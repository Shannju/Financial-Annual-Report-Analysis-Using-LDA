240One. Letter to ShareholdersI.  ForewordDear shareholders:The global economy remained largely stagnant throughout 2018 not only dueto interest rate hikes initiated by the Fed, but also because of the series of trade warswaged  by  President  Trump,  and  concerns  toward  China's  economic  prospectseventually resulted in the withdrawal of capital from equity markets. A weakenedRMB currency combined with foreign investors' decisions to underweight Taiwanequity caused the NTD to weaken from less than NT$30 per US$1 to nearly NT$31per US$1. At this point, we expect the global economy to slow down even furtherin 2019, which will ultimately affect Taiwan. Key areas to pay attention to include:whether the Fed ceases its rate hikes, whether the trade wars result in settlement,and whether capitals pending continue to weaken, but overall, the following  yearwill pose many challenges to Taiwan as far as economic growth is concerned.Despite intensifying volatility and competition within the global market, theBank still managed to maintain high growth thanks to its exceptional managementteam and highly efficient organization. Not only has the Bank out-performed peersin earnings, the organization also won recognition from local and major awards suchas: Global Finance - “The Best Banks in Taiwan from Global Finance”; Euromoney- “Regional Best Service in Asia Pacific”' The Banker - “Best Transaction Bank inAsia-Pacific 2018”; Asiamoney - “Best Bank for CSR from Asiamoney”; TaiwanAcademy of Banking and Finance - “Best Risk Management - Outstanding,” “BestWealth  Management  -  Excellent”  and  “Best Trust  Service  -  Excellent”;  IDC  DXAwards  -  “Omni  Experience  Innovator”;  and  Wealth  Magazine  -  “Best  WealthManagement.” It is evident that financial products and services offered by the Bankhave been well-perceived by experts local and abroad.At the end of 2018, the Bank had a total of 164 branches deployed throughoutTaiwan. With respect to key overseas markets, the Bank currently operates 2 whollyowned subsidiaries, 1 joint venture bank, 6 branches and 5 representative offices intotal. In the China market, the Bank commenced operation of its subsidiary - CathayUnited  Bank  (China)  Ltd.  on  September  3,  2018,  which  will  be  working  closelywith the Bank's  Hong  Kong Branch to grow  cross-border services and develop anew  variety  of  RMB-denominated  financial  products. As  for  the  Southeast Asianmarket, the Bank has already established presence in 9 of the 10 ASEAN countries,1making it the Taiwanese bank with the broadest service coverage in Southeast Asia.Through expansion of service network, integration of group resources and workingwith local strategic partners, the Bank aims to create a one-stop financial serviceplatform  to  the  benefit  of  more  corporate  customers,  and  take  progressive  stepstoward becoming “Asia's leading bank.”In  terms  of  service  innovation,  the  Bank  has  been  combining  intra-grouptechnologies  and  resources  locally  and  abroad  to  create  a  “smart  investment”platform that improved both the scope and added value of financial service. Frominformation, investment subscription to after-sale service, this new platform bringsdigital solutions to conventional processes. Furthermore, the Bank uses big data todevelop smart decision logics and applies them to products such as personal loanand credit card for optimal digital experience during application and transaction, aswell as strengthened customer relations in terms of breadth and depth.For  more  effective  fulfillment  of  corporate  social  responsibilities,  the  Banktransformed into Taiwan's first equator bank and has since been combining financialexpertise with environmental issues to support a low-carbon economy. The  Bankhas  long  been  supporting  domestic  and  foreign  solar  energy  industries  throughproject  lending  as  a  means  to  minimize  impact  of  industrial  activities  on  theenvironment and society. An announcement to voluntarily comply with UNEP FI“Principles  for  Responsible  Banking”  was  made  to  further  fulfill  the  Bank'scorporate sustainability efforts, its vision of becoming the market's leading brand ingreen  banking,  and  its  goals  toward  “sustainable  environmental,  social  andeconomic developments.”The  Bank  perceives  talent  as  the  cornerstone  to  future  growth,  and  hascommitted efforts into creating a complete talent bank and training programs, forwhich  it  was  awarded  “Best  Talent  Development  -  Outstanding”  by  TaiwanAcademy of Banking and Finance and ranked first in People Development Awardsof Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Awards. In the future,  the Bank  will continueintegrating resources throughout the financial group to build a stronger organization,and actively expand business in size and scope under rigorous risk control and strictcompliance with local as well as foreign laws to fulfill its long-term vision.II.  2018 business reportThe Bank had been able to maintain growth across all main business activitiesin 2018; key accomplishments as of the end of 2018 are as follows:2(I)Consumer banking service1.

Impacts of the competitive environment, regulatory environment,and overall business environment(I)  External competitionStagnation  of  the  global  economy  combined  with  curtailed  capitalexpenditure  have  given  the  IMF,  World  Bank  and  Fed  reasons  to  adjusteconomic  outlook  in  a  negative  way.  Rising  interest  rates  and  intensifyingtrade conflict between China and the USA may even put the global economyin recession. In response, the Bank will continue tightening control over creditexposures  while  promoting  financial  products  and  services  with  a  creativemindset that aims to cater for revenues and risks at the same time.The wave of “digital revolution” has given rise to new technologies anddigital  banking  service,  changed  the  conventional  banking  and  marketingpractices, and fueled the growth of virtual channels to the extent that physicalbranches are being forced to  undergo transformation. Today,  it is necessaryfor banks to invest into the creation of an online banking environment and toguide  branches  toward  transformation,  while  at  the  same  time  cater  forcustomers'  experience  and  transaction  security.  Technologies  have  alreadychanged the ways of the financial industry, and uprise of virtual and cloud-based services is believed to disrupt the competitive landscape even further,making FinTech companies the primary competitor.Although competition in the Greater China Region and Southeast Asiahas escalated due to deregulation on foreign investors, banks in general shouldbe able to take advantage of this development now that new business modelsare available.(II)  The regulatory environmentIn  light  of  major  information  security  incidents  reported  by  local  andforeign  financial  institutions  in  recent  years,  the  Financial  SupervisoryCommission  has  amended  “Implementation  Rules  of  Internal  Audit  andInternal  Control  System  of  Financial  Holding  Companies  and  BankingIndustries”  and  imposed  requirements  for  financial  service  providers  toestablish designated security units for the planning, monitoring and executionof  information  security  measures.  The  Bank  has  responded  to  the  legalrequirement and the need for additional security protection by assembling itsInformation Security Department in March 2018.16The  Bank  places  great  emphasis  on  how  the  regulatory  environmentaffects its business. In addition to enforcing internal control and compliance,the  Bank  has  internal  policies  in  place  to  address  important  issues  such  asconsumer  protection,  AML/CTF  and  corporate  social  responsibilities.Training and compliance self-assessments are being held on a regular and ad-hoc basis to promote compliance culture and practice among employees of allgrades and departments.(III) The overall business environmentOutlook  of  the  global  economy  in  2018  will  be  largely  affected  byuncertainties  surrounding  the  China-US  trade  conflict,  the  slowdown  inChina's  economic  growth,  monetary  policies  of  major  economies,  andpolitical/economic distractions in Europe. Overall, growth of global trade andeconomic activities are expected to lessen in the coming year. While the Fedcontinues to increase interest rates, other major economies remain divided intheir monetary policies. The world should expect more frequent cross-bordermovement of capital, and fragile economies may suffer as a result. Domesticinvestors and consumers may turn conservative in the coming year, and hindergrowth momentum of Taiwan's economy.The Bank will strive to maintain consistency of its business performance,bring  more  complete  financial  services  and  account  features  to  customers,secure deposit source, and optimize customer experience. The Bank also aimsto develop integrated investment solutions for customers of special needs, andtake  advantage  of  group  synergy  by  cross-selling  them  through  Cathaysubsidiaries online as well as offline to attract new capital.VI.

Bank profileI.  Date of Establishment:January 4, 1975II.  Bank history:The  United  World  Chinese  Commercial  Bank  (UWCCB)  and  CathayCommercial Bank (CCB) was merged and renamed Cathay United Bank. UWCCBwas  found  in  September  1971  during  the  4th  Cathay  Financial  AssociationGathering where representatives of Chinese  entrepreneurs  around the world gavetheir determined support to the economy of their motherland. A total of 17 nationaland  regional  overseas  Chinese  leaders  as  well  as  17  members  of  The  BankersAssociation of Taipei provided 50% of the investment shares to establish UWCCB.In May 1974, the Conference of Sponsors was convened, creating a bank with anapproved capital sum of US$ 12 million. Shares would be divided into equal halvesto  domestic  shareholders  and  overseas  shareholders.  In  December  1974,  theMinistry  of  Finance  submitted  the  relevant  applications  to  the  Executive  Yuan,which then approved the establishment of Cathay United Bank. UWCCB flagshipoffice  at  No.  10, Yongsui  Street, Taipei  City  formally  opened  for  business  on  20May  1975.  Cathay  United  Bank  later  acquired  Overseas  Chinese  Trust  andInvestment Co., Ltd. on 17 April 1995.Cathay Commercial Bank (CCB) was originally founded as the First Trust andInvestment Co., Ltd. which established in June 1971. The reelection of the entireboard of directors and election of Chen-yu Tsai as Chairperson of the Board in 1993served  as  a  turning  point  for  this  Company.  Mr.  Tsai  initiated  the  5-YearReformation  Program  and  successfully  renamed  the  Company  as  HuitongCommercial Bank Co., Ltd. on 16 November 1998. Cathay United Bank was laterrenamed as Cathay Commercial Bank (CCB) on 3 July 2002.We  have  initiated  financial  reformations  in  response  to  the  government'sFinancial  Holding  Company  Act.  Since  Taiwan's  entry  to  the  World  TradeOrganization  (WTO),  we  have  faced  intense  competition  from  multinationalfinancial  conglomerates.  We  thus  provided  our  clients  with  improved  andcomprehensive  financial  services.  Both  Cathay  Commercial  Bank  (CCB)  andUnited  World  Chinese  Commercial  Bank  (UWCCB)  joined  Cathay  FinancialHoldings Co., Ltd. in 22 April 2002 and 18 December 2002 respectively, becoming18two wholly-owned subsidiary banks under Cathay Financial Holdings. To maximizethe  combined  performance  of  Cathay  Financial  Holding,  we  have  implementedmeasures  such  as  integrating  the  resources  of  the  two  banks,  streamliningoperational  costs,  improving  operational  efficiency,  and  expanded  our  services.Both  UWCCB  and  CCB  have  been  merged  in  compliance  with  the  FinancialInstitution  Merger Act  and  other  relevant  laws.  UWCCB  would  be  the  survivingcompany  while  CCB  would be dissolved in  the  merger. The  merger contract  andother associated issues were resolved and passed in the Board of Directors meetingon 21 April 2003 and approved in 26 June by the Ministry of Finance. The referencedate for the merger was 27 October 2003. The merged bank was renamed “CathayUnited Bank Co., Ltd.”.To  expand  the  scope  of  services  provided  and  our  market  share,  we  thenacquired Diqi Shangye Yinhang (Seventh  Commercial  Bank) on 1 January  2007.Further  growth  was  achieved  by  accepting  specific  asset  debt  balances  andoperations of Zhonglian Xintuo on 29 December 2007. Since these acquisitions andmergers, Cathay United Bank has  continued  to expand its local branch offices inTaiwan, becoming a private bank with the largest number (164) of branches.19Three.

The basis of remuneration disclosed above is different from the basisof the Income Tax Act; for this reason, the amount has been prepared solelyfor information disclosure, and not for tax purpose.1.  Remuneration  to  directors,  supervisors  and  managers  are  determinedaccording  to  the  Bank's  “Director  and  Supervisor  CompensationGuidelines”  and  “Manager  Compensation  Guidelines”;  both  policieshave  been  resolved  in  board  meetings.  Amount  of  remuneration  isdecided  based  on  responsibilities,  capacity  and  annual  performance  ofeach  individual,  while  taking  into  consideration  the  benchmark  level.Both  the  remuneration  policy  and  amount  are  adjusted  according  tocurrent  and  future  risks  and  overall  business  performance  to  ensurealignment with shareholders' long-term interest.2.In the “Director and Supervisor Compensation Guidelines” (referred toas  the  “Guidelines”  below),  a  director’s  compensation  includes  fees,remuneration, and traffic and other allowances.(1)  Compensation:  The  Bank  may  compensate  directors  (includingChairman/Vice  Chairman)  who  personally  participateintheexecution of business activities.

These directors may also receive bonus at managers' ratedepending on annual performance.Compensation  for  independent  directors  and  external  directors59appointed by the parent company is evaluated according to rules ofthe parent company; directors who concurrently assume managerialposition  within  the  Bank  are  not  entitled  to  receive  directorcompensation.(2)  Remuneration:  In  profit-making  years,  the  Bank  may  pay  out  nomore  than  0.1%  of  earnings  as  remuneration  to  directors  andsupervisors (i.e. the parent company).(3)  Transportation and other allowances are paid at the standards statedin the Guidelines.3.  The Bank has “Manager Compensation Guidelines” in place that outlinesmanagers' monthly salary, allowance, bonus and retirement benefits.The board of directors of Indovina Bank convenes meetings twice a year,for which it is compensated with travel allowance of US$6,000 per session.Given  Indovina  Bank's  stature  as  a  Vietnam-registered  subsidiary  jointlycontrolled by Industrial and Commercial Bank of Vietnam (50%), the Bankrespects the decisions of its Vietnamese partner on related issues, includingdirector  remuneration,  provided  that  such  decisions  are  fair  and  do  notadversely impact shareholders' interest.60IV.Implementation of Corporate Governance:(I)Operation of the Board of Directors:A total of    7    meetings (A) were held in the last year(2018); below are directors’ andFunctionality of the Board of Directorssupervisors’ attendance records:TitleNameActualattendance(B)Attendanceby proxyChairmanViceChairmanManaging

Analysis  of  location  of  business,  future  market  supply,  demand  andgrowth, and competition(1)  Supply①  The government's efforts at creating a digital banking environment hasattracted financial institutions into developing big data applications anddiverse digital solutions such as investment, deposit, payment and loans,147all for the purpose of providing personalized and convenient service tocustomers.  Meanwhile,  deregulation  of  online-only  banks  will  furtherintensify competition within the financial industry.②  The domestic financial market is already saturated with competition, andas peers invest an increasing amount of resources into new technology,bringing innovations of financial services such as AI-based investmentservice,  and  developing  diversified  methods  to  manage  differentcustomer segments, such as ultra high net worth individuals and families,to explore business opportunities.(2)  Demand and growthThe global equity market has turned in strong gains in the last few yearsas investors' confidence recovered in line with the U.S. economy. However,concerns about the trade war between China and the USA will undoubtedlysuppress  economic  recovery  in  the  coming  year,  causing  central  banksaround  the  world  to  be  more  cautious  about  interest  rate  hikes.  The  low-interest  environment  is  expected  to  remain,  which  increases  investors'demand for income. Furthermore, recent reforms of government employeeannuity schemes have brought the public’s attention to retirement planning,and  increased  demands  for  principle-guaranteed  products  as  well  asinvestment solutions. There is ample room for banks to grow in midst of therising demand.(3)  Competitive advantageThe  Bank's  wealth  management  service  received  awards  on  manyoccasions in 2018, including: “Best Wealth Management” and “Best TrustService”  during  Taiwan  Banking  and  Finance  Best  Practice  Awardsorganized by Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance; and “Best WealthManagement of Banks” in Business Today's Wealth Management Survey.These accomplishments are a testament to the Bank's efforts and innovativecapacity.The  Bank  possesses  many  advantages  including  a  reputable  trackrecord,  trusted  corporate  image,  broad  customer  base,  extensive  servicenetwork, and diverse financial products and services. It also has the abilityto  integrate  group  resources  and  cross-sell  through  a  combination  ofphysical and virtual channels for synergistic effect, and ultimately improvecustomer relations and overall satisfaction.1482.  Future opportunities, threats, and response strategies(1)  Opportunities, threats and response strategies in Taiwan  Opportunities①  The Bank has several advantages including an extensive customerbase, diverse products from the financial group, and comprehensivebranch  coverage  that  enable  it  to  provide  timely,  suitable  andlocalized financial products and services to customers.②  The  government  is  actively  supporting  electronic  payments  andoffering  incentives  for  merchants  and  consumers  with  the  goal  toincrease  usage  by  multiple  folds.  These  efforts  will  also  result  inincreased credit card usage.③  The  Bank  currently  operates  164  branches  domestically.  Thisextensive  coverage  enables  it  to  build  relationship  and  offer  fullrange  of  financial  services  to  local  SME  customers  and  relatedparties for additional revenues.④  The  size  of  credit  cards  continues  to  grow,  and  online  and  offlinetransaction  data  now  offer  more  analytical  values  than  they  didbefore.  Exchanging  information  with  strategic  partners  fromdifferent  industries  helps  identify  customers'  needs  at  greaterprecision,  an  advantage  that  the  Bank  may  exploit  to  createdifferentiation  and  improve  brand  competitiveness  by  offeringservices beyond expectation.⑤  Fintech can be used to improve convenience of the trading platform,enrich the information provided, and enhance consultative servicesfor funds and insurance. Fintech also has the potential to integratedifferent services for better digital experience and added value.⑥  Research  institutions  are  generally  conservative  about  the  short-term  and  medium-term  outlook  of  the  global  economy  due  to  theChina-US trade war, China's economic slowdown, and stagnation indeveloped economies (such as EU). This strain on financial marketperformance is expected to continue into 2020. The business worldhas  grown  conservative  in  terms  of  capital  requirement  andinvestment,  which  the  Banking  industry  has  responded  by  closelymonitoring  credit  risks  and  industry  changes  in  lending  activities,and  shifting  focus  toward  asset  quality  and  service  diversity  forimproved performance.149  Threats①  Intensive  market  competition  and  aggressive  credit  card  privilegeofferings from peers have resulted in additional marketing costs andundermined profitability.②  Credit cards have been used more commonly as a payment tool andless so as a financing tool in recent years, which makes commissionsand  fees  the  primary  form  of  revenue.  Furthermore,  banks  arepromising higher levels of reward at higher costs in an attempt toappeal  to  customers,  which  limits  profit  potentials  of  the  entireindustry.③  Electronic  payment  service  providers  and  their  account  linkagefeatures present direct competition for credit card usage and youngcustomers without credit cards.④  Digital  innovations  around  the  world  have  changed  customers'demand and preferences to such an extent that conventional bankingservices and products can no longer satisfy customers' diverse needs,and the speed at which deregulations occur will present a significantobstacle to service innovations within the financial industry.⑤  In terms of industry competition, banks are facing challenges fromnew  (quasi-)  financial  service  providers  and  online-only  banks  asrecent  deregulations  no  longer  make  banking  an  exclusivelychartered business.⑥  The competent authority’s tightened control over the product-sellingprocess will impact business development and increase compliancecosts. Increasing revenues under balanced risk and compliance willprove to be a challenging task.⑦  It  is  difficult  for  banks  to  enjoy  excess  profit  margin  due  tosaturation of the domestic financial market and the prevailing low-interest  environment.  Furthermore,  given  the  rapid  changes  infinancial  products  and  the  banking  environment,  banks  have  toconstantly  adjust  and  adapt,  which  presents  major  challenge  tofuture operations.⑧  While domestic interest rates remain low, banks have very limitedroom  to  profit,  particularly  given  the  excessive  number  of  highlyhomogeneous  branches  operating  simultaneously.  The  margin  ondeposit and lending activities has been reduced to the point that they150no  longer  contribute  to  the  overall  performance.  As  a  result,Taiwan's banking industry now exhibits lower production value andprofitability compared to its Asia Pacific counterparts.  Response measures①  Combine channel resources and explore payment scenarios throughstrategic alliance; target high spending customers for profitability.②  Monitor  customers'  online  and  offline  transaction  activities;  learnand capitalize on the needs of target customers through data analysis;increase the size of highly loyal customers by creating the optimalfinancial ecosystem.③  Explore new payment scenarios and combine channel resources tocreate new pipelines for young customers.④  Coordinate  group  resources  toward  improving  overall  serviceexperience  of  existing  customers;  enforce  a  customer-centricbusiness  philosophy,  offer  products  and  services  needed  bycustomers  and  strive  to  deliver  consistent  customer  experienceacross all channels through service integration.⑤  Increase the depth and breadth of customer data gathered; apply bigdata  analysis  to  explore  customers'  potential  needs  and  providesuitable  service  and  product  referrals;  integrate  financial  servicecapacity across digital and physical channels, and create a cycle ofpositive experience that ultimately improves customer satisfaction.⑥  Integrating across devices, platforms and physical/virtual channels,provide  digital  cashflow  service  and  enhance  accountcollection/payment functions to become customers' primary banker.⑦  Make optimal use of existing customer base and physical channels,and intensify intra-group business referral in ways that improve thedepth and breadth of relationship with top customers.⑧  Given  the  rapid  evolution  of  financial  products,  the  financialindustry remains desperately in need of competent talents, which iswhy the Bank will continue improving its training system and aimto build a workforce of adequate quality, quantity, and professionalcharacters to support wholesale banking growth.151(2)  Opportunities, threats and response strategies in overseas markets  OpportunitiesThe Bank's target markets still present significant business opportunitiesgiven their strong growth potentials and favorable conditions.  ThreatsSupervisory  standards  have  tightened  around  the  world,  increasingoverall compliance cost.  Response measures①  Enhance  the  robustness  of  compliance  and  risk  managementsystems and enforce accordingly.②  Enhance risk management and customer analysis for more effectivemanagement of risk; grow overseas markets with an innovative yetconsistent strategy.(V)  Research and development of new financial instruments1.

1. [NPL ratio] decreased: Total loan balance at the end of 2018 was NT$135.7 billion higher compared to the end of 2017, and although asset quality remained consistent, overall NPL ratio decreased as a result. 
2. [Asset growth rate] decreased: Mainly attributed to a 130% reduction in the growth rate of “Security and derivative investments” at the end of 2018 compared to the end of 2017. 
3. [Profit growth rate] decreased: Mainly attributed to a NT$1.6-billion increase in loan loss expense and guarantee liability provision at the end of 2018 compared to the end of 2017. 
4. [Cash flow ratio], [cash flow adequacy] and [cash flow coverage ratio] decreased: Due to decreased net cash flow from operating activities in 2018.

4. [Cash flow ratio], [cash flow adequacy] and [cash flow coverage ratio] decreased: Due to decreased net cash flow from operating activities in 2018.(Note): Net cash flow from investing activities was negative, hence not calculated.* Companies that prepare standalone financial statements are also required to provide financial analysis on a standalone basis. 
* Companies that prepare IFRS-compliant financial information for less than 5 years are also required to complete Table (2) below and report financial information using financial accounting standards ofthe R.O.C.Note 1: Data from 2014 to 2018 have been audited and certified by the independent auditors. 
Note 2: Formulas of various analyses are defined below:1. Operating ability(1) Deposit to loan ratio = total loan/ total deposit 
(2) NPL ratio = total non-performing loan / total loan 
(3) Interest Expense to Average Total Deposits = total interest expense on deposits / yearly average deposit balance 
(4) Interest Revenue to Average Total Loans = total interest revenue from credit / yearly average creditbalance 
(5) Total asset turnover = net income / average total assets 
(6) Average revenues per employee (Note 7) = net income / total employees 
(7) Average earnings per employee = net profit after tax/ total employees2. Profitability(1) Return on tier 1 capital =net profit before tax / average tier 1 capital. 
(2) ROA = net profit after tax / average total assets. 
(3) ROE = net profit after tax/ average shareholders’ equity. 
(4) Net profit margin =net profit after tax/net income179(5) Earnings per share (EPS) = (attributable to shareholders’ equity of the parent – preferred stock dividends)/weighed average quantity of outstanding shares. (Note 5)3. Financial structure(1) Liabilities to assets ratio = total liabilities / total assets. 
(2) Ratio of property & equipment to shareholders' equity = net property, plant and equipment / shareholders’ equity.4. Growth rate(1) Asset growth rate = (total assets in current period – total assets in previous period)/total assets in previous period 
(2) Profitability growth rate = (net profit before tax in current period – net profit before tax in previous period)/ net profit before tax in previous period5. Cash flows (Note 8)(1) Cash flow ratio = net cash flow from operating activities / (interbank borrowing and overdraft + commercial papers payable + financial liability at fair value through profit or loss + Notes and 
bonds issued under repurchase agreements + account payable within one year). 
(2) Cash flow adequacy = net cash flows from operating activities in the last 5 years/(capital expenditure + cash dividend) in the last 5 years 
(3) Cash flow coverage ratio = net cash flow from operating activities /net cash flow from investing activities6. Liquidity reserve ratio = liquid assets mandated by The Central Bank / mandatory liquidity reserves. 
7. Scale of operation(1) Market share of assets = total assets / total assets of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activities (Note 6) 
(2) Market share of net worth = net worth / total net worth of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activities 
(3) Market share of deposits = total deposit / total deposit of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activities 
(4) Market share of loans = total loan / total loan of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activitiesNote 3: Total liabilities are net of provisions for guarantees and accidental losses. 
Note 4: Attention to the following is required when the aforementioned equations for the calculation of EPS are applied to assessment:1. The weighted average quantity of outstanding common shares shall be used as the standard, not the quantity of outstanding shares at the end of the year. 
2. In case of raising capital through issuing new shares or transactions of treasury stocks, calculate also the weighted average quantity of outstanding shares in the period of circulation. 
3. In case of capitalization of retained earnings or capitalization of capital surplus into new shares, adjustment shall be made in retrospect to the size of capitalization for each instance when calculatingthe earnings per shares annually or semi-annually. The time of issuance can be neglected.4. If the preferred shares are non-convertible accumulated preferred shares, the dividend declared in current period (whether paid or unpaid) shall be deducted from corporate earnings or as additionto earnings after taxation.5. If the preferred shares are not accumulative in nature, dividend for preferred shares shall be deducted fromnet profit after tax, if any. In case of loss, no adjustment shall be made.Note 5: Financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan-related activities include local banks, Taiwanese branches of Mainland banks, Taiwanese branches of foreign banks, credit cooperativeassociations, and credit departments of farmers / fishermen associations.Note 6: Revenue refers to the sum of interest and non-interest revenues. 
Note 7: The cash flow analysis takes into account the following:1. Net cash flow from operating activities is taken from the amount of net cash flow from operating activities presented in the cash flow statement. 
2. Capital expenditure refers to the amount of annual cash outflow for capital investments. 
3. Cash dividends include cash dividends to both common shares and preferred shares. 
4. Gross property, plant and equipment refers to the amount before deducting accumulated depreciation.180Capital adequacy ratioUnit:  NT$  thousandTitleCapitalYear20182017201620152014Capital adequacy ratio for the most recent yearConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneCommon share equity173,805,139166,969,563151,860,690149,392,107145,012,403142,855,418139,878,041137,882,930131,625,085129,668,042Tier 1 non-common share equity34,304,20628,371,34333,690,07331,871,91720,424,62018,882,42520,879,20319,364,36120,005,43518,565,629Tier 2 capitalCapital64,789,65951,801,63868,268,77664,210,86855,891,56652,872,41260,968,54357,726,82763,187,80260,342,558272,899,004247,142,544253,819,539245,474,892221,328,589214,610,255221,725,787214,974,118214,818,322208,576,229Standardized approach1,525,409,8361,445,220,0931,373,772,0641,315,254,8311,390,674,2521,333,208,6751,182,259,5771,135,664,6681,173,616,2321,136,962,763Credit RiskInternal ratings based approach----------Asset securitization20,415,15320,415,15310,723,54910,723,54914,450,81614,450,8169,457,0499,457,0498,411,8668,411,866Risk weightedassetsOperation RiskBasic indicator approach

[Securitized assets] increased: Securitized assets were NT$13.5 billion higher in 2018 compared to 2017. [Standardized approach] increased: Interest rate, exchange rate, and equity risk exposures decreased compared to the previous year, with equity 
risk exposure representing the highest decrease.1. All financial information from 2014 to 2018 has been verified by CPA. 
2. Capital, risk-weighted assets and total risk exposure shown in this table have been calculated according to “Regulations Governing the Capital Adequacy and Capital Category ofBanks” and “Calculation Explanation and Form for Bank Regulatory Capital and Risk-Weighted Assets.”3. Below are the formulas used for calculations in this table:(1) Capital = common share equity + Tier 1 non-common share equity + Tier 2 capital. 
(2) Total risk weighted assets = credit risk weighted assets + required capital for (operational risk + market risk) × 12.5. 
(3) Capital adequacy ratio = capital/ total risk weighted assets. 
(4) Tier 1 capital as a % of risk-weighted assets = (common share equity + other tier 1 capital that is not common share equity) / total risk-weighted assets. 
(5) Common share equity as a % of risk-weighted assets = common share equity / total risk-weighted assets. 
(6) Leverage ratio = net tier 1 capital / total risk exposure.4. TWSE and TPEX-listed companies are also required to disclose financial information up till the quarter immediately preceding the publication date of annual report, and specifywhether the financial information has been audited, auditor-reviewed or neither.5.

The  Bank  has  a  Risk  Management  Division  that  is 
supported by independent and specialized departments 
and functional teams to oversee management, planning, 
execution and control of credit management associated 
with credit, investment, and financial products.The credit risk reporting and assessment system covers

improvements  to  risk  quantification  technologies  and 
risk assessment models, the Bank also refines its stress 
testing methodology for better control of asset quality, 
and takes precautionary measures as deemed necessary.Borrowers and counterparties are regularly analyzed for 
credit  risk  profile  and  severity  of  losses  in  order  to 
determine  appropriate  measures  for  risk  avoidance  or 
mitigation,  including:  rejection  of  service,  conditional 
service, collateral or credit guarantee. With the help of 
systems  such  as  interim  credit  review  and  collateral 
management,  the  Bank  is  able  to  monitor  all  types  of 
mitigation tools used in business.5.

operational  risk  self-assessment,  reports  operational  risk 
incidents,  and  uses  key  risk  indicators  to  help  identify, 
assess, and monitor risks: 
(1)  Operational  risk  self-assessment:  To  identify  risks 
associated  with  operational  activities  as  well  as  the 
underlying  cause,  control  methods  and  risk  exposure, 
and thereby enable response plans.(2)  Operational  risk  incident  reporting:  The  reporting 
process  is  triggered  whenever  an  operational  risk 
incident  occurs,  so  that  the  underlying  cause  can  be 
identified, assessed, and discussed for improvement.(3)  Key risk indicators: Develop indicators for the potential

the  top  priority.  For  this  reason,  capital  estimates  are 
made  conservatively  and 
the  Bank  focuses  on 
developing diversity and stability in its funding sources. 
Furthermore,  uses  of  capital  are  balanced  between 
safety  and  profitability,  with  steps  taken  to  diversity 
liquidity risks.(2)  Both  the  Market  Risk  Management  Department  and 
Finance  and  Accounting  Department  are  informed 
immediately  of  any  material  changes  in  liquidity 
position,  whether  actual  or  anticipated,  which  are 
subsequently reported to the board of directors.(3)  The  Bank  has  liquidity  risk  tolerance  limits  and  alert 
indicators  in  place  to  manage  liquidity  risks.  Factors 
that  have  an  adverse  effect  on  liquidity  are  analyzed 
with  measures  taken  immediately  to  mitigate  liquidity 
risk impacts upon occurrence of an unexpected event.(1)  The  Bank  has  an  Asset  and  Liability  Management 
Committee  responsible  for  the  strategic  planning  and 
supervision  of  liquidity  risks.  Routine  execution  is2011. Liquidity risk managementstrategies and procedures2. Liquidity risk managementorganization and frameworkItemDetails3. Scope and features of theliquidity risk reporting and

Guidelines” available to manage liquidity position and 
liquidity  risks,  and  support  business  risk  management 
by maintaining solvency.(1) Some of the liquidity risk controls adopted by the Bank 
include: 
ratio,  deposit  diversity 
measure,  investment  diversity  measure,  and  funding 
diversity measure.loan-to-deposit(2)  The  Bank  manages  liquidity  risk  by  preparing 
“Liquidity  Reserve  Requirement  Report,”  “Maturity 
Analysis  Report,”  “Liquidity  Gap  Analysis  Report,” 
and  “Liquidity  Coverage  Ratio  Report”  on  a  regular 
basis.  These  reports  are  used  to  monitor  liquidity 
indicators and ensure that figures are within limit.(3) In addition to monitoring liquidity risk through monthly 
reports, the Bank also conducts quarterly liquidity stress 
tests as  means to assess its debt servicing capabilities. 
Outcomes  are  reported  to  the  board  of  directors  every 
six months.(1)  Deposit  concentration  is  examined  regularly  whereas 
“NTD  Maturity  Analysis  Report”  is  prepared  on  a 
monthly  basis  to  monitor  the  percentage  of  negative 
gaps accumulated in each  maturity interval relative to 
the  Bank's  current  net  worth,  and  therefore  determine 
the  level  and  extent  of  risk.  A  “Foreign  Currency 
Liquidity  Gap  Analysis”  is  prepared  for  any  foreign 
currency  that  accounts  for  more  than  5%  of  total 
liability.  This  report  monitors  negative  gap  in  foreign 
currency  assets  and  liabilities  relative  to  total  foreign 
currency assets, and provides decision makers with an 
indication  of  how  to  diversify  capital  source  and 
maturity.(2) Overseas branches are required to devise capital plans 
based  on  asset/liability  allocation  and  outcomes  of 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity analysis. Sourcing 
and use of capital shall comply with rules of the local 
authority  and  take  into  account  factors  such  as  safety 
and revenue potentials. Any mismatch in the maturity of 
assets and liabilities also have to be properly managed. 
Branches are required to discuss capital plans with the 
Head Office so that funding can be arranged on a bank-202ItemDetailswide basis. Any change in asset/liability allocation that 
requires an adjustment to the capital plan will have to 
be discussed with the Head Office before proceeding.(1) The Bank has implemented “Business Crisis Response 
Measures  and  Management  Guidelines”  to  prevent 
solvency and liquidity crises that may arise  in relation 
to  occurrences  such  as  abnormal  deposit  withdrawal, 
substantial  loss  of  capital  or  liquidity  shortage.  The 
Guidelines  not  only  ensure  timely  and  effective  crisis 
handling, but also mitigate impact from major or sudden 
occurrences  to  the  protection  of  deposit  holders, 
investors, traders and market discipline.(2)  The  Asset  and  Liability  Management  Committee 
convened  meetings  to  devise  responses  whenever 
liquidity reserve falls below a certain level.The Bank performs stress tests on liquidity risk at least on 
a quarterly basis to assess the Bank's debt-serving capacity 
should  a  liquidity  crisis  occur,  and  thereby  measure  and 
manage liquidity risks. Results of the stress test are reported 
to 
the  board  of  directors  every  six  months.  Any 
irregularities  noticed  on  the  reports  are  escalated  to  the 
Treasury  Department,  and  escalated  by  the  Finance  and 
Accounting  Department  during  Asset  and  Liability 
Management  Committee  meetings  to  adjust  the  Bank's 
asset and liability structure. 
(1) Source adequate cash support. 
(2)  Balance  sheet  adjustment:  recover  funds  or  explorealternative sources of capital or funding channel.(3) Issue official statements to clarify facts.

A  “risk-based  approach”  has  been  adopted  tomanage such impacts when performing various financial services.The  following  is  a  summary  of  key  compliance-related  actions  undertakenduring the year:1. Assessment and management of compliance risksThe  Bank  has  adopted  a  compliance  risk  management  and  supervisionframework, and will assess compliance risks on all business activities of theBank with succeeding actions commencing.2.

These Guidelines are current in effect.3. Implementation of information security unit and trainingThe  Bank  has  created  a  dedicated  information  security  unit  that  isadequately staffed and equipped to perform duties independently. The unitadopts  information  security  roadmap  of  the  parent  company  -  CathayFinancial  Holdings  as  guiding  principles  and  implements  informationsecurity protections throughout the Bank in accordance with laws and self-governing rules as part of its internal control environment. The unit is alsoresponsible  for  maintaining certification with  global information  securitystandards (such as ISO 27001 and PCIDS). Furthermore, the Bank engagesexternal consultants and white hat hackers to perform security assessmentsand tests on a yearly basis, so that improvements can be made as necessaryto enhance information security protection.(III)  Impact  on  the  Bank’s  financial  standing  due  to  technological  or  industrialchanges, and corresponding countermeasures:1. Considering  how  technology-inspired  mobile  solutions  have  become  anintegral part of consumers' lifestyle, the Bank continues to collaborate withnew businesses from different industries to introduce mobile services thatare convenient and relevant to customers' lifestyle, and thereby deliver theultimate  digital  banking  and  payment  experience.  By  analyzing  thetransaction  data  gathered,  the  Bank  is  able  to  analyze  customers'requirements  at  greater  precision,  and  incorporate  financial  service  into204various lifestyle scenarios to realize its vision of lifestyle banking.2. The ongoing mobility trend has inspired the Bank to research Fintech andrelated  applications,  and  develop  a  multitude  of  online  services  bygathering and analyzing customers' information through  big  data.  Today,customers are able to submit requests for a broad range of services onlinesuch as travel insurance, annuity insurance to property insurance all withoutthe  constraint  of  time  or  space.  The  mobility  enhancement  also  enablesfinancial  advisors  to  sell  insurance  using  tablets  (MI),  which  not  onlyappealed to young policyholders but also affirmed the Bank's commitmentto the paperless movement and environmental protection issues.3. Digital  banking  opens  up  innovations  while  payment  service  reducespeople's dependency on cash. Together, they create a cashless environmentand  give  rise  to  new  payment  channels  that  not  only  change  customers'shopping  needs  and  behaviors,  but  also  enable  gathering  of  transactioninformation for the creation of a banking environment that conforms withpeople's  needs.  This  integration  between  payment  service  and  mobiledevice allows merchants to develop new ways to interact with customersand presents banks with new profit models.4. Through integration of internal and external resources and cooperation withstrategic partners and Fintech companies, the Bank is able to create a digitalecosystem that further enhances its competitive position within the industry.5.

Before  1  January  2018,  the  Group  recognized  the  considerationreceived in advance from customers under other current liabilities (deferred income).Starting from 1 January 2018, in accordance with IFRS 15, it should be recognizedas  contract  liabilities.  The  amount  reclassified  from  deferred  income  to  contractsliabilities of the Group as at the date of initial application was $1,487,838 thousand.In addition, compared with the requirements of IAS 18, deferred income decreasedby $1,382,319 thousand and the contract liabilities increased by $1,382,319 thousandas at 31 December 2018.Please refer to Note 4, Note 5 and Note 6 for additional disclosure note required byIFRS 15.263B. IFRS 9“Financial Instruments”IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”. Inaccordance with the transition provision in IFRS 9, the Group elected not to restateprior periods at the date of initial application (1 January 2018). The adoption of IFRS9 has the following impacts on the Group:(A)  The Group adopted IFRS 9 since 1 January 2018 and it adopted IAS 39 before 1January 2018. Please refer to Note 4 for more details on accounting policies.(B)  In  accordance  with  the  transition  provision  in  IFRS  9,  the  assessment  of  thebusiness  model  and  classification  of  financial  assets  into  the  appropriatecategories are based on the facts and circumstances that existed as at 1 January2018.  The  classifications  of  financial  assets  and  its  carrying  amounts  as  at  1January 2018 are as follow:IAS 39Measurement categoriesFair value through profit or lossFair value through other comprehensive incomeAvailable-for-sale financial assets-netAt amortized costCash and cash equivalentsDue from the Central Bank and call loans to banksSecurities purchased under agreements to resellReceivables-netDiscounts and loans-netHeld-to-maturity financial assets-netOther financial assets-netCarryingamountsIFRS 9Measurement categories$311,985,059Fair value through profit or lossFair value through other comprehensive income148,480,669At amortized costCarryingamounts$332,975,371177,551,59347,851,927Cash and cash equivalents47,849,426125,163,780Due from the Central Bank and call loans to banks125,154,82587,483,656Debt instrument investment measured at amortized cost376,053,20776,980,817Securities purchased under agreements to resell87,477,3811,434,558,167Receivables-net34,345,085Discounts and loans-net1,276Other financial assets77,148,8051,434,558,1671,27618,353,3082,677,123,359(72,897)(5,993)(116,847)Investments in debt securities with no active market-net388,287,593Other assets-netOther assets-netSubtotalAllowance for impairment of off Balance Sheet ItemsReserve for losses on guaranteesThe letters of credit receivablesReserve for financing commitments18,354,6012,673,492,630SubtotalAllowance for impairment of off Balance Sheet Items(72,897)    Reserve for losses on guarantees(5,993)The letters of credit receivables-Reserve for financing commitmentsTotal$2,673,413,740Total$2,676,927,622264(C)  The  transition  adjustments  from  IAS  39  to  IFRS  9  for  the  classifications  offinancial assets and financial liabilities as at 1 January 2018 are as follow:IAS 39IFRS 9earningsequityItemsCarrying amountsItemsCarrying amounts    DifferenceAdjustmentAdjustmentOtherRetainedcomponents ofFinancial assets at fair value throughprofit or lossHeld-for-trading-netSubtotalAvailable-for-sale financial assets-netSubtotal$311,667,971Measured at fair value through profit or loss$311,667,830Debt instruments measured at fair value317,088through other comprehensive income311,985,05911,491,530317,08711,491,765Measured at fair value through profit or lossEquity instruments measured at fair value14,721,496122,267,643through other comprehensive incomeDebt instruments measured at fair valuethrough other comprehensive income148,480,66916,452,595122,267,643Held-to-maturity financial assets-net9,843,981Measured at fair value through profit or loss9,642,970SubtotalInvestments in debt securities withno active market-netSubtotalCash and cash equivalentsDue from the Central Bank and callloans to banksSecurities purchased underagreements to resellReceivables-netDiscounts and loans-netOther financial assets-netOther assets-netTotal financial assetsAllowance for impairment of offBalance Sheet ItemsReserve for losses on guaranteesthe letters of credit receivablesReserve for financing commitmentsTotal financial liabilitiesDebt instruments measured at fair value14,036,543through other comprehensive income10,464,561Debt instrument investment measured atamortized cost34,345,08514,968,52910,463,454162,817Measured at fair value through profit or loss172,80623,545,739365,589,75347,849,426125,154,82587,477,38177,148,8051,434,558,1671,27618,353,308Debt instruments measured at fair value22,522,413through other comprehensive income365,602,363Debt instrument investment measured atamortized cost388,287,59347,851,927Cash and cash equivalents125,163,780Due from the Central Bank and call loans tobanks87,483,656Securities purchased under agreements toresell76,980,817Receivables-net1,434,558,167Discounts and loans-net1,276Other financial assets-net18,354,601Other assets-net2,673,492,630Total financial assetsAllowance for impairment of off BalanceSheet Items(72,897)Reserve for losses on guarantees(5,993)the letters of credit receivables-Reserve for financing commitments(78,890)Total financial liabilities$(141)(1)2351,731,099-(201,011)931,986(1,107)9,989$(141)(212)(334,673)40,446(18,126)(201,011)(3,295)(1,107)9,989$-211334,9081,690,65318,126-935,281--1,023,326(2,724)1,026,050(12,610)(12,610)(2,501)(8,955)(2,501)(8,955)(6,275)(6,275)--------4,005,229----167,988--(1,293)2,677,123,3593,630,729(72,897)(5,993)(116,847)(195,737)--(116,847)(116,847)167,988--(1,293)(374,500)--(116,847)(116,847)Total$2,673,413,740Total$2,676,927,622$3,513,882$(491,347)$4,005,229265In addition to the effects of changes on financial assets and liabilities in the above 
table due to the transition from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 as at 1 January 2018, the effects 
of changes in deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities and income taxes are 
represented  by  the  increase  of  deferred  tax  assets  by  $4,694  thousand,  the 
increase of deferred tax liabilities by $319,634 thousand, the decrease of retained 
earnings  by  $1,268  thousand  and  the  decrease  of  other  equity  by  $313,672 
thousand.(D)  Effects on the date of initial applicationIn  accordance  with  classification  and  measurement  of  financial  assets  and 
impairment assessment in IFRS 9, the consolidated companies expect to increase 
assets  by  $3,635,423  thousand,  increase  liabilities  by  $436,481  thousand, 
decrease retained earnings by $492,615 thousand and increase other equity by 
$3,691,557  thousand  on  the  date  of  initial  application  (1  January  2018).  The 
related descriptions are as follows: 
 
a.  Classification and measurement of financial assetsParts of held-to-maturity financial assets and Investments in debt securities 
with no active market are reclassified to financial assets at fair value through 
other comprehensive income and parts of available-for-sale financial assets 
are reclassified to financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income,  thus  reflect  the  impact  from  adjustments  of  unrealized  gains.  The 
assets increased by $3,496,801 thousand, the liabilities increased by $314,205 
thousand, retained earnings decreased by $484,779 thousand and other equity 
increased by $3,667,375 thousand. 
 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
 
Financial assets which are classified as held-for-trading in financial assets at 
fair value through profit or loss (including stocks, short-term bills, beneficiary 
certificates, bonds and derivative instruments) in accordance with IAS 39, are 
classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9. 
 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
 
In accordance with of IAS 39, the Group’s available-for-sale financial assets 
included 
in  beneficiary  certificates,  stocks  and  bonds. 
Adjustment details are described as follow: 
 
(a)  Beneficiary certificatesinvestmentsAs the cash flow characteristics for beneficiary certificates are not solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, 
so beneficiary certificates are classified as financial assets mandatorily 
measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9. 
As at the date of initial application, the Group will reclassify available-
for-sale financial assets to financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss.266(b)  StocksUpon  de-recognition  of  equity  investments  currently  classified  as 
available-for-sale measured at fair value, the accumulated gains or losses 
previously  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  was  recycled  to 
profit or loss from equity. However, under IFRS 9, subsequent fair value 
changes  of  the  aforementioned  equity  investments  are  recognized  in 
other  comprehensive  income  and  cannot  be  recycled  to  profit  or  loss. 
Upon  de-recognition,  the  accumulated  amounts  in  other  component  of 
equity is reclassified to retained earnings (reclassification to profit or loss 
is not allowed). 
 
Based on the facts and circumstances that existed as on 1 January 2018, 
aside  from  part  of  the  financial  assets  which  are  not  held-for-trading 
investments  designated  to  measure  at  fair  value  through  other 
comprehensive  income,  the  others  should  be  reclassified  as  financial 
assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.  No  difference  from  carrying 
amount exists when stocks are mearsured at fair value.(c)  BondsAs  the  cash  flow  characteristics  for  bonds  are  solely  payments  of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, based on the 
facts and circumstances that existed as on 1 January 2018, bonds should 
be reclassified from available-for-sale financial assets to financial assets 
measured at  amortized cost  in  accordance with  IFRS 9 if the financial 
assets  are  held  within  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  to  hold 
financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows. The difference 
between  fair  value  and  amortized  cost  previously  recognized  will  be 
adjusted  to  other  equity  and  the  carrying  amount  of  the  reclassified 
financial  assets.  The  financial  assets  should  also  be  assessed  for 
impairment in accordance with IFRS 9. 
 
Bond  investments  held  within  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  to 
hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows should be 
classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income under IFRS 9. No difference from  carrying amount exists, and 
the  aforementioned  assets  should  be  assessed  for  impairment  in 
accordance with IFRS 9.   
 
Bond  investments  whose  cash  flow  characteristics  are  not  solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding 
should be classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
under IFRS 9. The reclassification doesn’t result in any difference from 
carrying amount.267Held-to-maturity financial assets and debt instrument investments for which 
no active market exists 
  
Bond investments classified as held-to-maturity financial assets and loans and 
receivables (placed in debt instrument investments for which no active market 
exists)  according  to  IAS  39  and  whose  cash  flow  characteristics  are  solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, based 
on  the  facts  and  circumstances  that  existed  on  1  January  2018,  should  be 
reclassified  from  held-to-maturity  financial  assets  and  debt  instrument 
investments for which no active market exists to financial assets measured at 
amortized  cost  in  accordance  with  IFRS  9  if  the  financial  assets  are  held 
within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order 
to collect contractual cash flows. No difference from carrying amount exists, 
and  the  aforementioned  assets  should  be  assessed  for  impairment  in 
accordance with IFRS 9. 
 
Held-to-maturity financial assets and debt instrument investments for which 
no active market  exists held within a business model whose objective is to 
hold  financial  assets  in  order  to  collect  contractual  cash  flows  should  be 
reclassified  as  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive 
income  under  IFRS  9. The  reclassification  of  business  model  will  increase 
other equity and the carrying amount of the reclassified financial assets. The 
aforementioned assets should also be assessed for impairment in accordance 
with IFRS 9. 
 
Bond  investments  classified  as  loans  and  receivables  (placed  in  debt 
instrument investments for which no active market exists) according to IAS 
39 and whose cash flow characteristics are solely payments of principal and 
interest on the principal amount outstanding should be classified as financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
Other effects 
 
The  Group  applies  to  the  classification  and  measurement  requirements  in 
IFRS 9, and increases the deferred tax assets and liabilities accordingly.b.  Impairment assessment of financial assetsThe  Group  recognized  adjustments  of  expected  credit  losses  of  on-balance 
sheet  and  off-balance  sheet  debt  instruments,  which  increased  assets  by 
$138,622  thousand,  increased  liabilities  by  $122,276  thousand,  decreased 
retained earnings by $7,836 thousand and increased other equity by $24,182 
thousand.268As for financial assets (e.g. on-balance sheet debt instruments and off-balance 
sheet debt instruments) that are not measured at fair value through profit or 
loss, the impairment of debt  instruments is evaluated by applying expected 
credit risk model in accordance with IFRS 9. If the credit risk of the financial 
assets doesn’t increase significantly after the initial recognition, the allowance 
for losses will be measured at 12-month expected credit losses. If the credit 
risk of the financial assets increases significantly after the initial recognition 
and is not low credit risk, the allowance for losses will be measured at credit 
losses  during  remaining  term  to  maturity.  For  receivables  and  contractual 
assets arose from the transactions in the scope of IFRS 15, credit losses are 
evaluated  by  simplified  method.  The  aforementioned  rule  of  impairment 
assessment is different from incurred losses model applied currently.(E)  A reconciliation of the allowance for impairment balance recognized by incurred 
loss model in IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” 
to the allowance for impairment balance under the expected credit loss model in 
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” as at 1 January 2018 are as follows:Accounting item and measurement typeReceivablesDue from the Central Bank and call loans to banksFinancial assets at fair value through profit orloss(IAS39)Classfied as financial assets at fair value through othercomprehensive income (IFRS 9)Available-for sale financial instruments (IAS 39)Classified as financial assets at fair value throughother comprehensive income (IFRS 9)Investments in debt securities with no active market (IAS39)Classified as financial assets at fair value throughother comprehensive income (IFRS 9)Classified as investments in debt instrument measuredat amortized cost (IFRS 9)Held-to-maturity financial assets (IAS 39)Classified as financial assets at fair value throughother comprehensive income (IFRS 9)Classified as financial assets measured at amortizedcost (IFRS 9)Financing commitmentsOthers (Note 1)TotalAllowance forimpairmentbalance underIAS 39$2,431,464reclassification    remeasurement$(167,805)$-Allowance forimpairmentbalance underIFRS 9$2,263,659---8,9558,955-3737146,379(146,379)18,12618,126-----13$2,577,856-2,7242,724-----$(146,379)13,74513,7453,2953,2951,107116,84710,069$7,1001,107116,84710,082$2,438,577Note1: Others contained cash and cash equivalents, securities purchased under agreement to resell, other financial assets and otherassets.269Notes:  As the Group compares the allowance for doubtful accounts provided inthe classification assessment of credit assets with the allowance for lossescalculated under the expected credit loss model in IFRS 9 and sets asidethe  higher  one  as  required  by  local  competent  authorities,  there  is  noimpact on the balance of allowance for losses provided for the discountsand loans, guarantee receivables and the letters of credit receivables as at1 January 2018.(F)  Please refer to note 4, 5, 6 and 12 for further details on disclosures under IFRS7 "Financial Instruments: Disclosures” and IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”.C. Prepayment features with negative compensation (Amendments to IFRS 9)The  amendment  allows  financial  assets  with  prepayment  features  that  permit  orrequire a party to a contract either to pay or receive reasonable compensation for theearly termination of the contract, to be measured at amortized cost or at fair valuethrough  other  comprehensive  income.  The  amendment  has  been  issued  by  IASB(effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019), but has not  yetbeen endorsed by FSC. However, for the Q&As issued by FSC on 12 December 2017,the Group considers them to be necessary for adoption, so the Group has early appliedthem on 1 January 2018. The Group does not expect the adoption of such standardswill have significant impact on the consolidated companies.D.

sheet  model  (subject  to  certain  exemptions).  Lessor  accounting  still  uses  the  dual 
classification approach: operating lease and finance lease.B. IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments”The interpretation clarifies application of recognition and measurement requirements 
in IAS 12 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.C. IAS 28 “Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures” – Amendments to IAS 28The  amendments  clarify  that  an  entity  applies  IFRS  9  to  long-term  interests  in  an 
associate or joint venture that form part of the net investment in the associate or joint 
venture before it applies IAS 28, and in applying IFRS 9, does not take account of 
any adjustments that arise from applying IAS 28.D. Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards (2015-2017 cycle)IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” 
 
The amendments clarify that an entity that has joint control of a joint operation shall 
remeasure its previously held interest in a joint operation when it obtains control of 
the business.   
 
IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements” 
 
The amendments  clarify that an  entity that  participates in,  but  does not  have joint 
control of, a joint operation does not remeasure its previously held interest in a joint 
operation when it obtains joint control of the business.   
 
IAS 12 “Income Taxes” 
 
The amendments clarify that an entity shall recognize the income tax consequences 
of  dividends  in  profit  or  loss,  other  comprehensive  income  or  equity  according  to 
where the entity originally recognized those past transactions or events. 
 
IAS 23 “Borrowing Costs” 
 
The amendments clarify that an entity should treats as part of general borrowings any 
borrowing made specifically to obtain an asset when the asset is ready for its intended 
use or sale.271E. Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement – Amendments to IAS 19The amendments clarify that when a change in a defined benefit plan is made (such 
as  amendment,  curtailment  or  settlement,  etc.),  the  entity  should  use  the  updated 
assumptions to remeasure its net defined benefit liability or asset.The  above-mentioned  standards  and  interpretations  issued  by  IASB  and  endorsed  by 
FSC. The  Bank  elected  to  apply  this  interpretation  prospectively  on  1  January  2019. 
Apart  from  item  A.  explained  below,  ths  change  in  accounting  principle  did  not 
significantly impact the Bank's recognition and measurement.A. IFRS 16 “Leases”IFRS  16  “Leases”  replaces  IAS  17  “Leases”,  IFRIC  4  “Determining  whether  an 
Arrangement contains a Lease”, SIC-15 “Operating Leases - Incentives” and SIC-27 
“Evaluating  the  Substance  of Transactions  Involving  the  Legal  Form  of  a  Lease”. 
The impact arising from the adoption of IFRS 16 on the Group are summarized as 
follows:a.  For the definition of a lease, the Group elects not to reassess whether a contract is, 
or contains, a lease at the date of initial application (1 January 2019) in accordance 
with the transition provision in IFRS 16. Instead, the Group is permitted to apply 
IFRS 16 to contracts that were previously identified as leases applying IAS 17 and 
IFRIC 4 but not to apply IFRS 16 to contracts that were not previously identified 
as containing a lease applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.The  Group  is  a  lessee  and  elects  not  to  restate  comparative  information  in 
accordance with the transition provision in IFRS 16. Instead, the Group recognizes 
the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 as an adjustment to the opening 
balance of retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) at the 
date of initial application.Leases classified as operating leasesFor  leases  that  were  classified  as  operating  leases  applying  IAS  17,  the  Group 
expects to measure and recognize those leases as lease liability on 1 January 2019 
at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee’s 
incremental borrowing rate on 1 January 2019 and; the Group chooses, on a lease-
by-lease basis, to measure the right-of-use asset at either:(A)  Its carrying amount as if IFRS 16 had been applied since the commencement 
date,  but  discounted  using  the  lessee’s  incremental  borrowing  rate  on  1 
January 2019; or(B)  an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid 
or  accrued  lease  payments  relating  to  that  lease  recognized  in  the  balance 
sheet immediately before 1 January 2019.272The Group expects the right-of-use asset will increase by 4,347,260 thousand, theother prepayments decrease 17,660 thousand, the lease liability will increase by4,354,604 thousand and  the other payables will decrease 25,004 thousand on 1January 2019.B. The additional disclosures of lessee and lessor required by IFRS 16 will be disclosedin the relevant notes.(3)  Newly issued, revised or amended standards or interpretations, which have been issuedby IASB but have not yet been endorsed by FSC, and have not yet been adopted by theGroup as at the date of issuance of the Group’s financial report, are listed below:Item

Amendments  to  IFRS  10  “Financial  Statements”  and  IAS  28  “Investments  in 
Associates and Joint Ventures”－Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investorand its Associate or Joint VentureThe  amendments  address  the  inconsistency  between  the  requirements  in  IFRS  10Financial Statements and  IAS  28  Investments  in Associates and Joint Ventures, indealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is contributed to an associate or ajoint  venture.  IAS  28  restricts  gains  and  losses  arising  from  contributions  of  non-monetary  assets  to  an  associate  or  a  joint  venture  to  the  extent  of  the  interestattributable  to  the  other  equity  holders  in  the  associate  or  joint  ventures.  IFRS  10requires full profit or loss recognition on the loss of control of the subsidiary. IAS 28was amended so that the gains  or losses resulting from  the sale or contribution ofassets  that  constitute  a  business  as  defined  in  IFRS  3  between  an  investor  and  itsassociate or joint venture is recognized in full.IFRS  10  was  also  amended  so  that  the  gains  or  losses  resulting  from  the  sale  orcontribution of a subsidiary that does not constitute a business as defined in IFRS 3between an investor and its associate or joint venture is recognized only to the extentof the unrelated investors’ interests in the associate or joint venture.273B. IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts”On initial recognition, an entity shall measure a group of insurance contracts at the 
total of the fulfilment cash flows and the contractual service margin. The fulfilment 
cash flows comprise of the following:   
 
(A)  estimates of future cash flows 
(B)  discount rate: an adjustment to reflect the time value of money and the financial 
risks related to the future cash flows, to the extent that the financial risks are not 
included in the estimates of the future cash flows(C)  a risk adjustment for non-financial risk 
 
Carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts as at the end of each reporting 
period represents the sum of the liability for remaining coverage and the liability for 
incurred compensation. 
 
In addition to general model, the standard provides:   
 
(A)  a  specific  application  approach  for  contracts  with  discretionary  participationfeatures (the variable fee approach).(B)  a  simplified  approach  for  short-term  contracts  (the  premium  allocationapproach).C. Definition of a Business (Amendments to IFRS 3)The  amendments  clarify  the  definition  of  a  business  in  IFRS  3  Business 
Combinations. The amendments are intended to assist entities to determine whether 
a  transaction  should  be  accounted  for  as  a  business  combination  or  as  an  asset 
acquisition.IFRS 3 continues to adopt a market participant’s perspective to determine 
whether  an  acquired  set  of  activities  and  assets  is  a  business.    The  amendments 
clarify the minimum requirements for a business; add guidance to help entities assess 
whether an acquired process is substantive; and narrow the definitions of a business 
and of outputs; etc.D. Definition of a Material (Amendments to IAS 1 and 8)The  main  amendment  is  to  clarify  new  definition  of  material.  It  states  that 
“information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be 
expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial 
statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial 
information about a specific reporting entity.”The  above-mentioned  standards  and  interpretations  issued  by  IASB  have  not  yet 
endorsed by FSC at the date when the Bank’s financial statements were authorized for 
issue,  the  local  effective  dates  are  to  be  determined  by  FSC. The  Group  is  currently 
determining the potential impact of the standards and interpretations.2744.  Summary of significant accounting policies(1)  Statement of complianceThe consolidated financial statements of the Group for the years ended 31 December 
2018 and 2017 have been prepared in accordance with the “Regulations Governing the 
Preparation  of  Financial  Reports  by  Public  Banks”,  the  “Regulations  Governing  the 
Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers”, the “Regulations Governing the 
Preparation  of  Financial  Reports  by  Securities  Firms”  and  “International  Financial 
Reporting  Standards”,  “International  Accounting  Standards”,  “Interpretations 
developed  by  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Interpretations  Committee  or  the 
former  Standing  Interpretations  Committee”  as  endorsed  and  became  effective  by 
Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic of China.(2)  Basis of preparationThe  consolidated  financial  reports  comprise 
the  consolidated  balance  sheet, 
consolidated  statements  of  comprehensive  income,  the  consolidated  statements  of 
change in equity, the consolidated statements of cash flows and related notes.   
 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  historical  cost  basis, 
except for financial instruments and investment property that have been measured at fair 
value. The consolidated financial statements are expressed in thousands of New Taiwan 
Dollars unless otherwise stated. 
 
The  Group  classifies  their  economic  activities  as  operating,  investing  and  financing 
activities in accordance with management’s judgment. The consolidated statements of 
cash  flows  presented  the  changes  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents  during  the  reporting 
period from operating, investing and financing activities. The components of cash and 
cash equivalents are disclosed in Note 6.(1).(3)  Basis of consolidationControl is achieved when the Bank is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement  with  the  investee  and  has  the  ability  to  affect  those  returns  through  its 
power over the Investee. Specifically, the Bank controls an investee if and only if the 
Group has: 
 
A. Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to directthe relevant activities of the investee)B. Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and 
C. The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns275When the Bank has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee,the  Bank  considers  all  relevant  facts  and  circumstances  in  assessing  whether  it  haspower over an investee, including:A. The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investeeB. Rights arising from other contractual arrangementsC. The Bank’s voting rights and potential voting rightsThe Bank re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstancesindicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the acquisition date, being the date on whichthe Bank obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such controlceases.    The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reportingperiod  as  the  parent  company,  using  uniform  accounting  policies.    All  intra-groupbalances,  income  and  expenses,  unrealized  gains  and  losses  and  dividends  resultingfrom intra-group transactions are eliminated in full.A  change  in  the  ownership  interest  of  a  subsidiary,  without  a  change  of  control,  isaccounted for as an equity transaction.Total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the parentand to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interestshaving a deficit balance.If the Bank loses control of a subsidiary, it:A. Derecognizes the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary;B. Derecognizes the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest;C. Recognizes the fair value of the consideration received;D. Recognizes the fair value of any investment retained;E. Recognizes any surplus or deficit in profit or loss; andF.  Reclassifies  the  parent’s  share  of  components  previously  recognized  in  othercomprehensive income to profit or loss.276The consolidated entities are listed as follows:InvestorSubsidiaryBusinessOwnership (%)nature2018.12.31  2017.12.31The Bank    Indovina Bank Limited (“Indovina Bank”) Indovina Bank wasWholesale50%incorporated in Vietnam on 21 November 1990.bankingThe Bank    Cathay United Bank (Cambodia) Corporation LimitedWholesale100%(”CUBC Bank”) SBC Bank was incorporated in Cambodia onbanking5 July 1993, and renamed as CUBC as of 14 January 2014.The Bank  Cathay United Bank (China) Limited (”CUBCN Bank”)Wholesale100%CUBCN Bank was incorporated in China on 3 Septemberbanking50%100%-2018. (Note)Note：  The  Bank  was  authorized  by  the  authorities  to  merge  Cathay  United  Bank-Shanghai  Branch,Cathay  United  Bank-Qingdao  Branch,  and  Cathay  United  Bank-Shenzhen  Branch’s  working 
capital into Cathay United Bank (China) Ltd.(4)  Business combinations and goodwillBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred,  measured at 
acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. 
For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets.    Acquisition costs incurred are expensed. 
 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the consideration transferred 
over  the  Bank’s  net  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.  If  this 
consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the 
difference is recognized in profit or loss. 
 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses.    For  the  purpose  of  impairment  testing,  goodwill  acquired  in  a  business 
combination  is,  from  the  acquisition  date,  allocated  to  each  of  the  Bank’s  cash-
generating  units  that  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the  combination,  irrespective  of 
whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. 
 
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within 
that  unit  is  disposed  of,  the  goodwill  associated  with  the  operation  disposed  of  is 
included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on 
disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based 
on the relative value of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating 
unit retained.277(5)  Investments accounted for using the equity methodThe  Bank’s  investment  in  its  associate  is  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method. An 
associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence. A joint venture is a 
type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement 
have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. 
 
When  an  associate  or  joint  venture  issues  new  stock,  and  the  Bank’s  interest  in  the 
associate  or  joint  venture  is  reduced  or  increased  as  the  Bank  fails  to  acquire  shares 
newly issued in the associate or joint venture proportionately to its original ownership 
interest,  the  increase  or  decrease  in  the  interest  in  the  associate  or  joint  venture  is 
recognized in additional paid-in capital and investments accounted for using the equity 
method. When the interest in the associate or joint venture is reduced, the cumulative 
amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit 
or  loss  or  other  appropriate  items.  The  aforementioned  capital  surplus  recognized  is 
reclassified to profit or loss on a pro rata basis when the Bank disposes the associate or 
joint venture. 
 
The  financial  statements  of  the  associate  or  joint  venture  are  prepared  for  the  same 
reporting  period  as  the  Bank.  Where  necessary,  adjustments  are  made  to  bring  the 
accounting policies in line with those of the Bank. 
 
In  accordance  with  IAS  28  “Investments  in Associates  and  Joint  Ventures”  (before  1 
January  2018:  IAS  39  “Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and  Measurement”),  the 
Bank determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the 
investment in the associate or an investment in a joint venture is impaired. If this is the 
case,  the  Bank  calculates  the  amount  of  impairment  as  the  difference  between  the 
recoverable  amount  of  the  associate  or  joint  venture  and  its  carrying  value  and 
recognizes the amount in the “share of profit or loss of an associate or joint venture” in 
the statement of comprehensive income as required by IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”. 
If using the investment’s value in use as the recoverable amount, the Bank determines 
the value in use based on the following estimates: 
 
A. Future cash flows the Bank expects to derive from the investment in the associate or 
joint venture, including cash flows from the operation of the associate and from the 
ultimate disposal of such investment, orB. Present value of the future cash flows from dividends expected to be received fromthe associate and from the disposal of the investment.Because  goodwill  included  as  part  of  the  carrying  amount  of  an  investment  in  an 
associate or an investment in a joint venture is not separately recognized, it is not tested 
for impairment separately by applying the requirements for testing goodwill impairment 
in IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”.278Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint venture, the Bank measures 
and recognizes any retaining investment  at  its fair value. Any difference  between the 
carrying amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant influence and 
the fair value of the retaining investment and proceeds from disposal is recognized in 
profit or loss. Furthermore, if an investment in an associate becomes an investment in a 
joint venture or an investment in a joint venture becomes an investment in an associate, 
the  Bank  continues  to  apply  the  equity  method  and  does  not  re-measure  the  retained 
interest.(6)  Foreign currency transactionsThe consolidated financial  statements are presented in  New Taiwan dollars, which is 
also the Bank’s functional currency. 
 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group entities at their 
respective functional currency rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional 
currency  closing  rate  of  exchange  ruling  at  the  reporting  date.  Non-monetary  items 
measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at 
the date when the fair value is determined. Non-monetary items that are measured at 
historical  cost  in  a  foreign  currency  are  translated  using  the  exchange  rates  as  at  the 
dates of the initial transactions. 
 
All exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating 
monetary items are taken to profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for 
the following: 
 
A. Exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings for an acquisition of 
a  qualifying  asset  to  the  extent  that  they  are  regarded  as  an  adjustment  to  interest 
costs are included in the borrowing costs that are eligible for capitalization.B. IFRS  9  “Financial  Instruments”  (Before  1  January  2018:  IAS  39  “Financial 
Instruments:  Recognition  and  Measurement”)  are  accounted  for  based  on  the 
accounting policy for financial instruments.C. Exchange  differences  arising  on  a  monetary  item  that  forms  part  of  a  reporting 
entity’s  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation  is  recognized  initially  in  other 
comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal of 
the net investment.When  a  gain  or  loss  on  a  non-monetary  item  is  recognized  in  other  comprehensive 
income,  any  exchange  component  of  that  gain  or  loss  is  recognized  in  other 
comprehensive income. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in 
profit or loss, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognized in profit or 
loss.279(7)  Translation of financial statements in foreign currencyThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into New Taiwan Dollarsat  the  closing  rate  of  exchange  prevailing  at  the  reporting  date  and  their  income  andexpenses  are  translated  at  an  average  rate  for  the  period.  The  exchange  differencesarising on the translation are recognized in other comprehensive income. On the disposalof a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating tothat foreign operation, recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated inthe separate component of equity, is reclassified from equity to profit or loss when thegain  or loss on disposal  is  recognized. When the partial  disposal  involves the loss ofcontrol of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, and the retained interest afterthe partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or a partial disposal of an interestin an associate that includes a foreign operation is a financial asset that includes a foreignoperation.Any  goodwill  and  any  fair  value  adjustments  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  andliabilities  arising  on  the  acquisition  of  a  foreign  operation  are  treated  as  assets  andliabilities of the foreign operation and expressed in its functional currency.(8)  Cash and cash equivalentsCash and cash equivalents in consolidated balance sheet comprise cash on hand, demanddeposits  and  short-term,  highly  liquid  time  deposits  or  investments  that  are  readilyconvertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk ofchanges  in  value.  The  Group  classifies  time  deposits  that  are  readily  convertible  toknown amounts of cash within twelve months and which are subject to an insignificantrisk of changes in value as cash equivalents. The consolidated statements of cash flowsconsist of cash and cash equivalents in consolidated balance sheet, due from the CentralBank and call loans to the banks and securities purchased under agreements to resellthat conformed to the definition of cash and cash equivalents in IAS 7.(9)  Bills and bonds under repurchase or resell agreementsBills  and  bonds  under  repurchase  or  resell  agreements  are  accounted  for  under  thefinancing method. Bills and bonds sold under repurchase agreements are presented as“Securities  sold  under  agreements  to  repurchase”  at  the  sale  date.  Bills  and  bondsinvested  under  resell  agreements  are  presented  as  “Securities  purchased  underagreements to resell” at the purchase date. The difference between the purchase or theselling price and the contracted resell or repurchase price is recorded as interest incomeor interest expense, respectively.280(10) Financial instrumentsFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
 
Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  within  the  scope  of  IFRS  9  “Financial 
Instruments” (Before 1 January 2018: IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement”)  are  recognized  initially  at  fair  value  plus  or  minus,  in  the  case  of 
investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. 
 
A. Financial assets: Recognition and MeasurementThe accounting policies from 1 January 2018 as follow: 
 
The Group accounts for regular way purchase or sales of financial assets on the trade 
date. 
 
The  Group  classified  financial  assets  as  subsequently  measured  at  amortized  cost, 
fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss 
considering both factors below: 
 
(A)  the Group’s business model for managing the financial assets and 
(B)  the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.   
 
Financial assets measured at amortized cost 
 
A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are 
met and presented as note receivables, trade receivables financial assets measured at 
amortized cost and other receivables etc., on balance sheet as at the reporting date:   
 
(A)  the  financial  asset  is  held  within  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  to  holdfinancial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows(B)  the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding.Such  financial  assets  are  subsequently  measured  at  amortized  cost  (the  amount  at 
which  the  financial  asset  is  measured  at  initial  recognition  minus  the  principal 
repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest 
method of any difference between the initial amount and the maturity amount and 
adjusted for any loss allowance) and is not part of a hedging relationship. A gain or 
loss is recognized in profit or loss when the financial asset is derecognized, through 
the amortization process or in order to recognise the impairment gains or losses.281Interest revenue is calculated by using the effective interest method. This is calculated 
by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset 
except for: 
 
(A)  purchased  or  originated  credit-impaired  financial  assets.  For  those  financial 
assets,  the  Group  applies  the  credit-adjusted  effective  interest  rate  to  the 
amortized cost of the financial asset from initial recognition.(B)  financial  assets  that  are  not  purchased  or  originated  credit-impaired  financial 
assets but subsequently have become credit-impaired financial assets. For those 
financial assets, the Group applies the effective interest rate to the amortized cost 
of the financial asset in subsequent reporting periods.Financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income 
 
A financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if 
both of the following conditions are met:   
 
(A)  the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achievedby both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and(B)  the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding.Recognition of gain or loss on a financial asset measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income are described as below: 
 
(A)  A  gain  or  loss  on  a  financial  asset  measured  at  fair  value  through  other 
comprehensive income recognized in other comprehensive income, except for 
impairment  gains  or  losses  and  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses,  until  the 
financial asset is derecognized or reclassified.(B)  When the financial asset is derecognized the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit 
or loss as a reclassification adjustment.(C)  Interest  revenue  is  calculated  by  using  the  effective  interest  method.  This  is 
calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of 
a financial asset except for:a.  Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets. For those financial 
assets,  the  Group  applies  the  credit-adjusted  effective  interest  rate  to  the 
amortized cost of the financial asset from initial recognition.b.  Financial assets that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial 
assets  but  subsequently  have  become  credit-impaired  financial  assets.  For 
those  financial  assets,  the  Group  applies  the  effective  interest  rate  to  the 
amortized cost of the financial asset in subsequent reporting periods.282In addition, for the equity instruments within the scope of application in IFRS 9 but 
neither held for trading nor applicable to the contingent consideration recognized by 
the acquirer in IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”, an irrevocable election can be made 
at  initial  recognition  to  recognize  subsequent  changes  in  fair  value  in  other 
comprehensive  income.  The  amount  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income 
should  not  be  subsequently  transferred  to  profit  or  loss  (the  accumulated  amount 
included in the other equity items should be transferred to retained earnings directly 
upon  the  disposal  of  such  equity  instruments),  but  should  be  presented  as  financial 
assets  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  in  the  balance  sheet. 
Dividends on investments are recognized in profit or loss unless the dividends clearly 
represent a recovery of part of the investment costs. 
 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
 
All financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss except that the 
aforementioned one that meet specific criterias are measured at amortized cost or at 
fair value through other comprehensive income, and presented as financial assets at 
fair value through profit or loss in the balance sheet. 
 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value. Gain 
or loss from the remeasurement are recognized in profit or loss. Dividends or interests 
on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in profit or loss. 
 
The accounting policies before 1 January 2018 as follow: 
 
The Group classifies its financial assets as either financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss, held-to-maturity financial assets, investment in debt securities with no 
active  market,  financial  assets  carried  at  cost,  available-for-sale  financial  assets, 
derivative financial assets for hedging and loans and receivables where appropriate. 
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss and financial liabilities carried at amortized cost. When financial assets 
or liabilities are recognized initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case 
of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction 
costs.   
 
The Group accounts for regular way purchase or sales of financial assets on the trade 
date (i.e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset). 
 
Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
 
Financial assets or liabilities include held for trading and designated by the Group at 
fair value through profit or loss are classified as financial assets or liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss.283A financial asset is classified as held for trading if: 
 
(A)  It is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing itin the near term;(B)  On initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments 
that  are  managed  together  and  for  which  there  is  evidence  of  a  recent  actual 
pattern of short-term profit-taking; or(C)  It is a derivative (except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract ora designated and effective hedging instrument).If  a  contract  contains  one  or  more  embedded  derivatives,  the  entire  hybrid 
(combined) contract may be designated as a financial asset at fair value through profit 
or loss; or a financial asset may be designated as at fair value through profit or loss 
when doing so results in more relevant information, because either: 
 
(A)  It  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  a  measurement  or  recognitioninconsistency; or(B)  A  group  of  financial  assets,  financial  liabilities  or  both  is  managed  and  its 
performances evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented 
risk  management  or  investment  strategy,  and  information  about  the  group  is 
provided internally on that basis to the key management personnel.Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value. When 
it  changes  in  fair  value  it  recognized  in  profit  or  loss.    Dividends  or  interests  on 
financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss 
(including those received during the period of initial investment).     
 
For  financial  liabilities  designated  as  at  fair  value  through  profit  and  loss,  the 
recognition of the full amount of change in the fair value in profit or loss only if the 
presentation of changes in the liability's credit risk in other comprehensive income 
would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. 
 
If financial assets do not have quoted prices in an active market and their fair value 
cannot be measured reliably, they are classified as financial assets measured at cost 
on balance sheet as at the reporting date. 
 
Held-to-maturity financial assets 
 
Non-derivative  financial  assets  with  fixed  or  determinable  collections  and  fixed 
maturity which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified 
as  held-to-maturity  financial  assets  and  reported  at  amortized  cost.  Such  gains  and 
losses are recognized when the investments are derecognized or impaired, as well as 
through amortized.284Available-for-sale financial assets 
 
Available-for-sale  financial  assets  are  measured  at  fair  value  with  gains  or  lossesbeing recognized as a separate component of equity except for impairment loss and 
foreign  currency  exchange  related  gains  or  losses,  until  the  investment  is 
derecognized at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity 
is  transferred  to  income  statement.  However,  any  difference  between  the  initialamount  and  the  maturity  amount  of  available-for-sale  financial  assets  shall  be 
amortized by effective interest method as interest income or expense over the relevant 
periods.Loans and receivables 
 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market other then:(A)  Those that the entity intends to sell immediately or in the near term, which shallbe classified as held for trading;(B)  Those that the entity upon initial recognition designates as at fair value throughprofit or loss;(C)  Those that the entity upon initial recognition designates as available-for-sale; or 
(D)  Those  for  which  the  holder  may  not  recover  substantially  all  of  its  initialinvestment, other than because of credit deterioration.Gains and losses are recognized when the investments are derecognized, impaired 
and as well as through the amortization process.Other financial assets 
 
(A)  Investments in debt securities with no active marketInvestment in debt securities with no active market are non-derivative financial 
assets  with  fixed  or  determinable  collections  that  are  not  quoted  in  an  active 
market.  Such  assets  are  carried  at  amortized  cost  using  the  effective  interest 
method.  Gains  and  losses  are  recognized  when  these  investments  arederecognized, impaired and as well as through the amortization process.(B)  Financial assets carried at costInvestment  in  equity  instruments  without  quoted  market  price  and  derivative 
instruments linked to or settled by delivery of such unquoted equity investments 
shall be measured at cost.285B. Impairment of financial assetsThe accounting policies from 1 January 2018 as follow: 
 
The Group recognizes and measures the allowance for losses of the debt instrument 
investments  measured  at fair value through other comprehensive income, the debt 
instrument  investments  measured  at  amortized  cost  and  off-balance  sheet  debt 
instruments on the basis of expected credit losses. The debt instrument investments 
measured  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  recognizes  the 
allowance for losses in other comprehensive income without reducing the carrying 
amount of such investments. In addition to be recognized and measured on the basis 
of expected credit losses, loans and receivables and off-balance sheet credit assets 
are also  recognized and  measured in  accordance  with  the  “Regulations Governing 
the  Procedures  for  Banking  Institutions  to  Evaluate  Assets  and  Deal  with  Non-
performing/Non-accrual  Loans”.  The  higher  values  are  used  to  make  appropriate 
provisions for the allowance for losses, reserve for losses on guarantees and reserve 
for financing commitments. 
   
The Group measures expected credit losses of a financial instrument in a way that 
reflects:   
 
(A)  an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating arange of possible outcomes;(B)  the time value of money; and   
(C)  reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or 
effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of 
future economic conditions.The loss allowance is measures as follow: 
 
(A)  At  an  amount  equal  to  12-month  expected  credit  losses:  the  credit  risk  on  a 
financial  asset  has  not  increased  significantly  since  initial  recognition  or  the 
financial  asset  is  determined  to  have  low  credit  risk  at  the  reporting  date.  In 
addition, the Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime 
expected  credit  losses  in  the  previous  reporting  period,  but  determines  at  the 
current  reporting  date  that  the  credit  risk  on  a  financial  asset  has  increased 
significantly since initial recognition is no longer met.(B)  At an amount equal  to  the lifetime expected credit losses:  the credit risk on a 
financial asset  has increased significantly since initial recognition  or financial 
asset that is purchased or originated credit-impaired financial asset.(C)  For trade receivables or contract assets arising from transactions within the scope 
of IFRS 15, the Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime 
expected credit losses.286In  addition,  in  accordance  with  the  “Regulations  Governing  the  Procedures  for 
Banking Institutions to Evaluate Assets and Deal with Non-performing/Non-accrual 
Loans”,  the  Bank  shall  allocate  sufficient  loan  loss  provision  and  reserves  against 
liability on guarantees. Classification system classifies normal credit assets under the 
first category, with poorer credit assets assessed based on the securities and the length 
of  time  overdue,  respectively  classified  as  second  category  special  mention,  third 
category  expectation  of  recovery,  fourth  category  difficulty  of  recovery,  and  fifth 
category no hope of recovery. 
 
The minimum loan loss provision and guarantee reserve shall be the sum of 1% of 
the outstanding balance of Category One credit asset’s claim (excluding assets that 
represent  claims  against  a  Taiwan  government  agency),  2%  of  the  balance  of 
Category Two credit assets, 10% of the balance of Category Three credit assets, 50% 
of the balance of Category Four credit assets, and the full balance of Category Five 
credit assets. 
 
At each reporting date, the Group needs to assess whether the credit risk on a financial 
asset has increased significantly since initial recognition by comparing the risk of a 
default  occurring  at  the  reporting  date  and  the  risk  of  default  occurring  at  initial 
recognition. Please refer to Note 12 for further details on credit risk. 
 
The accounting policies before 1 January 2018 as follow: 
 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence 
that a financial asset other than the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
is  impaired.    A  financial  asset  is  deemed  to  be  impaired  if,  and  only  if,  there  is 
objective  evidence  of  impairment  as  a  result  of  one  or  more  loss  events  that  has 
occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that loss event has an impact on 
the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset.    The carrying amount of the 
financial asset impaired, other than receivables impaired which are reduced through 
the use of an allowance  account,  is  reduced directly and the amount of the loss is 
recognized in profit or loss. 
 
A  significant  or  prolonged  decline  in  the  fair  value  of  an  available-for-sale  equity 
instrument below its cost is considered a loss event. 
 
Other loss events include: 
 
(A)  significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor; or 
(B)  a  breach  of  contract,  such  as  a  default  or  delinquency  in  interest  or  principalpayments; or(C)  it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financialreorganisation; or(D)  the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financialdifficulties.287thoughThe Group applies the following methods to determine the amount of any impairment 
loss:   
 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
 
When  a  decline  in  the  fair  value  of  an  available-for-sale  financial  asset  has  been 
recognized in other comprehensive income and there is objective evidence that the 
asset  is  impaired,  the  cumulative  loss  that  had  been  recognized  in  other 
comprehensive  income  shall  be  reclassified  from  equity  to  profit  or  loss  as  a 
reclassification  adjustment  even 
the  financial  asset  has  not  been 
derecognized.   
 
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, impairment losses 
are not reversed through profit or loss; increases in its fair value after impairment are 
recognized directly in other comprehensive income. If, in a subsequent period, the 
fair  value  of  a  debt  instrument  classified  as  available  for  sale  increases  and  the 
increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment losses 
was recognized in profit or loss, the impairment losses are reversed through, with the 
amount of the reversal recognized in profit or loss. 
 
Financial assets carried at amortized cost 
 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on a financial asset carried at 
amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured by the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash 
flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount 
of the financial asset is reduced either directly or through the use of an allowance 
account. The amount of the loss is recognized in profit or loss. 
 
If,  in  a  subsequent  period,  the  amount  of  the  impairment  loss  decreases  and  the 
decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was 
recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed either directly or 
by adjusting an allowance account. The reversal shall not result in a carrying amount 
of the financial asset that exceeds what the amortized cost would have been had the 
impairment not been recognized at the date the impairment is reversed. The amount 
of the reversal is recognized in profit or loss. 
 
Loans and receivables 
 
The  Group  first  assesses  whether  objective  evidence  of  impairment  exists 
individually  for  loans  and  receivables  that  are  individually  significant.  If  there  is 
objective evidence that an impairment loss on individual loans and receivables has 
been incurred, the amount of impairment loss should be assessed individually. If there 
is  objective  evidence  that  an  impairment  loss  on  a  loan  and  receivable  that  is  not 
individually significant has been incurred, the Bank shall include those assets in a 
group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assess 
them for impairment.288If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount 
of  loss  is  measured  as  the  difference  between  the  carrying  amount  of  loans  and 
receivables and the present  value of estimated  future cash flows  (excluding future 
credit losses that have not been incurred). The present value of the estimated future 
cash  flows  on  loans  and  receivables  is  discounted  at  the  financial  assets  original 
effective  interest  rate.  If  a  loan  has  a  variable  interest  rate,  the  discount  rate  for 
measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate. 
 
If,  in  a  subsequent  period,  the  amount  of  the  impairment  loss  decreases  and  the 
decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was 
recognized  (such  as  an  improvement  in  the  debtor’s  credit  rating),  the  previously 
recognized  impairment  loss  shall  be  reversed  either  directly  or  by  adjusting  an 
allowance account. The reversal shall not result in a carrying amount of the loan and 
receivable that exceeds what the amortized cost would have been had the impairment 
not  been  recognized  at  the  date  the  impairment  is  reversed.  The  amount  of  the 
reversal shall be recognized in profit or loss. 
 
In  addition,  in  accordance  with  the  “Regulations  Governing  the  Procedures  for 
Banking Institutions to Evaluate Assets and Deal with Non-performing/Non-accrual 
Loans”,  the  Bank  shall  allocate  sufficient  loan  loss  provision  and  reserves  against 
liability on guarantees. Classification system classifies normal credit assets under the 
first category, with poorer credit assets assessed based on the securities and the length 
of  time  overdue,  respectively  classified  as  second  category  special  mention,  third 
category    expectation of recovery, fourth category difficulty of recovery, and fifth 
category no hope of recovery. 
 
The minimum loan loss provision and guarantee reserve shall be the sum of 1% of 
the outstanding balance of Category One credit asset’s claim (excluding assets that 
represent claims against an ROC government agency), 2% of the balance of Category 
Two credit assets, 10% of the balance of Category Three credit assets, 50% of the 
balance of Category Four credit assets, and the full balance of Category Five credit 
assets.C.Derecognition of financial assetsA financial asset (or where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of 
similar financial asset) is derecognized when: 
 
(A)  The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired 
(B)  The Group has transferred the asset and substantially all the risks and rewards ofthe asset have been transferred(C)  The  Group  has  neither  transferred  nor  retained  substantially  all  the  risks  andrewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.On  derecognition  of  a  financial  asset  in  its  entirety,  the  difference  between  the 
carrying  amount  and  the  consideration  received  or  receivable  including  any 
cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income, is 
recognized in profit or loss.289D. Financial liabilities and equity instrumentsClassification between liabilities or equity 
 
The  Group  classifies  the  instrument  issued  as  a  financial  liability  or  an  equity 
instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement and the 
definitions of a financial liability, and an equity instrument. 
 
Equity instruments 
 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of 
an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group 
are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.The  transaction  cost  is  allocated  to  the  liabilities  and  equities  on  the  base  of  the 
proportion that convertible bonds allocated to the liabilities and equities at the initial 
recognition. 
 
When the holders of convertible bonds require to act the conversion rights before the 
due dates of the convertible bonds, adjust the book values of liabilities elements to 
the book values that should be at the time point of converting, as the basis of recoding 
the issuing of common share. 
 
Financial liabilities 
 
Financial  liabilities  within  the  scope  of  IFRS  9  “Financial  Instruments”  (before  1 
January 2018: IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”) are 
classified  as  financial  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  or  financial 
liabilities measured at amortized cost upon initial recognition. 
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held 
for trading and financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss.   
 
A financial liability is classified as held for trading if: 
 
(A)  it is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing itin the near term;(B)  on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments 
that  are  managed  together  and  for  which  there  is  evidence  of  a  recent  actual 
pattern of short-term profit-taking; or(C)  it is a derivative (except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract ora designated and effective hedging instrument).290If  a  contract  contains  one  or  more  embedded  derivatives,  the  entire  hybrid 
(combined) contract may be designated as a financial liability at fair value through 
profit or loss; or a financial liability may be designated as at fair value through profitor loss when doing so results in more relevant information, because either: 
 
(A)  it  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  a  measurement  or  recognitioninconsistency; or(B)  a  group  of  financial  assets,  financial  liabilities  or  both  is  managed  and  its 
performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented 
risk  management  or  investment  strategy,  and  information  about  the  group  is 
provided internally on that basis to the key management personnel.Gains  or  losses  on  the  subsequent  measurement  of  liabilities  at  fair  value  through 
profit or loss including interest paid are recognized in profit or loss.Before 1 January 2018, if the financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
do not have quoted prices in an active market and their far value cannot be reliably 
measured, then they are classified as financial liabilities measured at cost on balance 
sheet and carried at cost as at the reporting date.Financial liabilities at amortized cost 
 
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost include payables and loans that aresubsequently  measured  using  the  effective  interest  rate  method  after  initial 
recognition.    Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the liabilities 
are derecognized and amortized through the effective interest rate method.Amortized cost  is  calculated  by discount  or premium  happened in acquisition and 
transaction costs. 
 
Derecognition of financial liabilitiesA  financial  liability  is  derecognized  when  the  obligation  under  the  liability  is 
discharged,      cancelled or expired.When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on 
substantially  different  terms,  or  the  terms  of  an  existing  liability  are  substantially 
modified (whether or not attributable to the financial difficulty of the debtor), such 
an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability andthe  recognition  of  a  new  liability.  The  difference  between  the  respective  carrying 
amounts  and  the  consideration  paid,  including  any  non-cash  assets  transferred  or 
liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss.291E. Offsetting of financial instrumentsFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in thebalance sheet if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset therecognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize theassets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.(11) Derivative instrumentThe Group uses derivative instruments to hedge its foreign currency risks and interestrate risks.    A derivative is classified in the balance sheet as assets or liabilities at fairvalue through profit or loss except for derivatives that are designated effective hedginginstruments which are classified as derivative financial assets or liabilities for hedging.Derivative  instruments  are  initially  recognized  at  fair  value  on  the  date  on  which  aderivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  are  subsequently  remeasured  at  fair  value.Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financialliabilities when the fair value is negative.    Any gains or losses arising from changes inthe fair value of derivatives are taken directly to profit or loss, except for the effectiveportion of cash flow hedges, which is recognized in equity.Before  1  January  2018,  derivatives  embedded  in  host  contracts  are  accounted  for  asseparate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their economic characteristics and risksare not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not heldfor  trading  or  designated  at  fair  value  though  profit  or  loss.    These  embeddedderivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative. Theaforementioned  policy  are  applicable  to  host  contracts  as  financial  liabilities  or  non-financial assets since 1 January 2018.(12) Fair value measurementFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liabilityin an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement  date.    Thefair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the assetor transfer the liability takes place either:A. In the principal market for the asset or liability, orB. In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the assetor liabilityThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to by the Group.292The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market 
participants  would  use  when  pricing  the  asset  or  liability,  assuming  that  market 
participants in their economic best interest.   
 
A  fair  value  measurement  of  a  non-financial  asset  takes  into  account  a  market 
participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and 
best  use  or  by  selling  it  to  another  market  participant  that  would  use  the  asset  in  its 
highest and best use.   
 
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for 
which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant 
observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.(13) Impairment of non-financial assetsThe Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication 
that an asset in the scope of IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” may be impaired. If any 
such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the 
Bank  estimates  the  asset’s  recoverable  amount. An  asset’s  recoverable  amount  is  the 
higher of an asset’s or cash-generating units (“CGU”) fair value less costs to sell and its 
value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate 
cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. 
Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset 
is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
 
For  assets  excluding  goodwill,  an  assessment  is  made  at  each  reporting  date  as  to 
whether there is  any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no 
longer exist or may have decreased.  If such indication exists, the Bank estimates the 
asset’s  or  cash-generating  unit’s  recoverable  amount.  A  previously  recognized 
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been an increase in the estimated service 
potential  of  an  asset  which  in  turn  increases  the  recoverable  amount.  However,  the 
reversal  is  limited  so  that  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  does  not  exceed  its 
recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, 
net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. 
 
A cash generating unit, or groups of cash-generating units, to which goodwill has been 
allocated  is  tested  for  impairment  annually  at  the  same  time,  irrespective  of  whether 
there is any indication of impairment. If an impairment loss is to be recognized, it is first 
allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash generating 
unit (group of units), then to the other assets of the unit (group of units) pro rata on the 
basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit (group of units). Impairment losses 
relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods for any reason. 
 
An impairment loss of continuing operations or a reversal of such impairment loss is 
recognized in profit or loss.293(14) Financial guarantee contractsFinancial  guarantee  contracts  issued  by  the  Group  are  those  contracts  that  require  a 
payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified 
debtor  fails  to  make  a  payment  when  due  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  a  debt 
instrument.  Financial  guarantee  contracts  are  recognized  initially  as  a  liability  at  fair 
value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the 
guarantee.(15) Foreclosed propertiesForeclosed  properties  of  the  Group  represent  assets  acquired  by  repossession  of 
collateral for realization and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on the 
balance sheet date. If there is an objective evidence of impairment, the impairment loss 
shall be recognized.(16) LeaseAll the leasing contracts of the Group follow the regulations of IAS17 and SIC4 and are 
categorized as operating lease. If the Group is the lessee, the asset then is recorded as 
leased asset in the balance sheet. The rent payable and receivable of operating lease are 
recorded by its rental duration using straight-line method. They are recorded as “Other 
general and administrative expenses” and “Other net non-interest income”.(17) Property and equipmentProperty  and  equipment  is  stated  at  cost,  net  of  accumulated  depreciation  and/or 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of dismantling and 
removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located and borrowing costs for 
construction  in  progress  if  the  recognition  criteria  are  met. When  significant  parts  of 
property and equipment  are required to  be replaced in  intervals,  the Bank recognizes 
such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation, respectively. 
Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying 
amount  of  the  plant  and  equipment  as  a  replacement  if  the  recognition  criteria  are 
satisfied. All  other  repair  and  maintenance  costs  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  as 
incurred. 
 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line method over the following estimated useful 
lives: 
 
Building 
Machinery and equipment 
Transportation equipment 
Miscellaneous equipment5 - 60 
years 
3 -      8  years 
3 -      7  years 
3 - 15 
years294An  item  of  property  and  equipment  and  any  significant  part  initially  recognized  isderecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefit is expected from its useor disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is included in profitor loss.The  assets’  residual  values,  useful  lives  and  methods  of  depreciation  are  reviewed  ateach financial year end, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.(18) Investment propertiesInvestment  properties  are  measured  initially  at  cost,  including  transaction  costs. Thecarrying amount includes the cost of replacing part of an existing investment propertyat the time that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met and excludes the costsof day to day servicing of an investment property.    Subsequent to initial recognition,investment properties are measured using the fair value model in accordance with therequirements of IAS 40 “Investment property” for that model. Gains or losses arisingfrom changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in the consolidatedstatement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise, other than thosethat meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale (or are included in a disposal groupthat is classified as held for sale) in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Heldfor Sale and Discontinued Operations”.Investment properties are derecognized when either they have been disposed of or whenthe  investment  property  is  permanently  withdrawn  from  use  and  no  future  economicbenefit is expected from its disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceedsand  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  in  the  period  ofderecognition.The  fair  value  of  investment  properties  is  measured  on  the  character,  location  andcondition of specific property.(19) Intangible assetsIntangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.    Thecost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is its fair value as at the dateof acquisition.    Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost lessany accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any.    Internallygenerated intangible assets, excluding capitalized development costs, are not capitalizedand  expenditure  is  reflected  in  profit  or  loss  for  the  year  in  which  the  expenditure  isincurred.The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.295Intangible  assets  with  finite  lives  are  amortized  over  the  useful  economic  life  andassessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may beimpaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible assetwith a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each financial year. Changesin the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economicbenefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortization period ormethod, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.Intangible  assets  with  indefinite  useful  lives  are  not  amortized,  but  are  tested  forimpairment  annually,  either  individually  or  at  the  cash-generating  unit  level.    Theassessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinitelife  continues  to  be  supportable.    If  not,  the  change  in  useful  life  from  indefinite  tofinite is made on a prospective basis.Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as thedifference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset andare recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized.The category of intangible assets of the Group and the amortization method over theestimated useful lives are as follows:CategoryComputer softwareOther intangible assetsUseful livesAmortization method3 - 8 years4 yearsStraight-line methodStraight-line method(20) Income taxesIncome tax expense (income) is the aggregate amount included in the determination ofprofit or loss for the period in respect of current tax and deferred tax.Current income taxCurrent income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measuredat the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, usingthe tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end ofthe  reporting  period.  Current  income  tax  relating  to  items  recognized  in  othercomprehensive  income  or  directly  in  equity  is  recognized  in  other  comprehensiveincome or equity and not in profit or loss.The income tax for undistributed earnings is recognized as income tax expense in thesubsequent year when the distribution proposal is approved by the board of directors.296Deferred taxDeferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between the taxbases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  for  financial  reportingpurposes.Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:A. Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or ofan asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the timeof the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;B. In  respect  of  taxable  temporary  differences  associated  with  investments  insubsidiaries,  associates  and  interests  in  joint  ventures,  where  the  timing  of  thereversal  of  the  temporary  differences  can  be  controlled  and  it  is  probable  that  thetemporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognized  for  all  deductible  temporary  differences,  carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable thattaxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, andthe carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized, except:A. Where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arisesfrom the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a businesscombination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profitnor taxable profit or loss;B. In  respect  of  deductible  temporary  differences  associated  with  investments  insubsidiaries,  associates  and  interests  in  joint  ventures,  deferred  tax  assets  arerecognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences willreverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against whichthe temporary differences can be utilized.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to applyin the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and taxlaws  that  have  been  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at  the  reporting  date.  Themeasurement  of  deferred  tax  assets  and  deferred  tax  liabilities  reflects  the  taxconsequences that would follow from the manner in which the Bank expects, at the endof  the  reporting  period,  to  recover  or  settle  the  carrying  amount  of  its  assets  andliabilities. Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside profit or loss is recognizedoutside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognized in correlation to the underlyingtransaction  either  in  other  comprehensive  income  or  directly  in  equity.  Deferred  taxassets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognized accordingly.297Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable rightexists to set off current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and thedeferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.In accordance with Article 49 of the Financial Holding Company Act, the Company andits parent company jointly filed corporation income tax returns and 10% surcharge onundistributed retained earnings since 2002 under the integrated income tax system. Sucheffects on current tax and deferred tax are accounted for as receivable or payables.Effective  from  1  January,  2006,  the  Company  has  considered  the  impact  of  the“Alternative Minimum Tax Act” to estimate their income tax liabilities.(21) Employee benefitsDefined contribution plansThe Bank has a pension plan covering all full-time employees (the defined benefit plan).Under  the  plan,  pension  benefit  payments  for  each  employee  are  based  on  theemployee’s years of service and final average compensation. The Bank has establishedtwo employee retirement fund committees to supervise the employees’ retirement fundbased on the regulations of the employee retirement plan. Contribution to the pensionfund is made to the separate accounts of the above two committees monthly. The Bankmakes  contributions  to  the  pension  plan,  which  is  administered  and  operated  by  anindependent employee retirement fund committee. The pension plan is not reflected inthe consolidated financial statements. Pension benefits for employees of the overseassubsidiaries  and  the  branches  are  provided  in  accordance  with  the  respective  localregulations.The  Labor Pension Act  of the ROC (the  “Act”),  which adopts a defined  contributionpension plan, is effective on 1 July 2005. In accordance with the Act, employees of theBank may elect to be subject to either the Act, and maintain their seniority before theenforcement  of  the Act,  or  the  pension  mechanism  of  the  Labor  Standards Act.  Foremployees  subject  to  the  Act,  the  Bank  shall  make  monthly  contributions  to  theemployees’  individual  pension  accounts  on  a  basis  6%  of  the  employees’  monthlywages. Monthly contributions are recognized as pension costs.298The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and 
The date that the Group recognizes restructuring-related costsDefined benefit plans 
 
Post-employment  benefit  plan  that  is  classified  as  a  defined  benefit  plan  uses  the 
Projected Unit  Credit Method  to  measure its obligations and costs based on actuarial 
assumptions.Re-measurements,  comprising  of  the  effect  of  the  actuarial  gains  and 
losses, the effect of the 
asset ceiling (excluding net interest) and the return on plan assets, excluding net interest 
are recognized as other comprehensive income with a corresponding debit or credit to 
other equity in the period in which they occur.   
 
Past service costs are recognized in profit or loss on the earlier of: 
 
A. 
B. 
 
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability 
or asset, both as determined at the start of the annual reporting period, taking account of 
any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of 
contribution and benefit payment. 
 
Employee preferential interest rate deposits 
 
The  Bank  offers  its  employees  with  preferential  deposit,  including  providing  finite 
amount  preferential  interest  rate  deposits  to  current  employees  and  providing  the 
preferential interest rate deposits to current employees and retired employees after their 
retirement.  The  difference  between  the  interest  rate  of  preferential  deposits  and  the 
market rate is recognized as employee benefits.   
 
The finite amount preferential deposits that the Bank paid to its current employees are 
calculated  monthly  on  accrual  basis.  The  difference  between  the  interest  rate  of 
preferential deposit and the market rate is recorded as “Employee benefits expenses”. 
In  accordance  with  the  article  30  of  the  “Regulations  Governing  the  Preparation  of 
Financial Reports by Public Banks”, when the interest incurred from preferential interest 
rate deposits exceed the interest generated from market rate, it should be considered the 
actuarial  amount  according  to  defined  benefit  plan  regulated  on  IAS  19  “Employee 
Benefits” since the employee’s retirement date.(22) ProvisionsProvisions are recognized when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) 
as  a  result  of  a  past  event,  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Bank expects some or all of a provision 
to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset but only when the 
reimbursement is virtually certain. If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to 
the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage 
of time is recognized as a borrowing cost.299(23) Interest incomeInterest income is recognized over the period by applying the interest rate method andmeasured  except  for  delinquent  accounts  and  troubled  accounts  whose  interest  isrecognized when received.(24) Service fee income and award credits deferred incomeThe  revenues  from  contracts  between  the  Group  and  customers  mainly  include  theservice fee and award credits deferred income.The Group earns service fee from a diverse range of services it provides to its customers.The  award  credits  deferred  income  represents  the  award  credits  granted  to  the  creditcard  holders  by  the  Group.  The  accounting  treatments  are  described  respectively  asfollows:The accounting policies from 1 January 2018 are as follows:The  Group  earns  service  fee  and  award  credits  and  deferred  income  from  servicesprovided  at  a  specific  time  point,  over  a  period  of  time  or  from  transaction  servicesprovided then recognizes revenue. A contract asset is recognized when it has transferredservices  to  customers  but  has  not  yet  obtained  the  right  to  receive  the  considerationunconditionally.  While,  in  some  cases,  the  Group  has  received  part  of  considerationfrom customers when signing contracts, the Group shall bear the obligation to provideservices subsquently, then contract liability is recognized.Generally, the aforementioned contract liability of the Group should be transferred intoincome within one year, so there is no significant financial component resulted.The accounting policies before 1 January 2018 are as follows:The  Group  earns  service  fee  from  services  provided  at  a  specific  time  point,  over  aperiod of time or from transaction services provided then recognizes revenue. Awardcredits deferred income is recognized as deferred income at its fair value. The relatedpart of redeemed or expired award credits in deferred income are recognized as revenuewhen the award credits are redeemed or expired.300(25) Operating segment informationAn operating segment is a component of an entity that has the follow characteristics: 
 
A. Engaging in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses; 
B. Whose  operating  results  are  regularly  reviewed  by  the  entity’s  chief  operating 
decision marker to make decisions about resource to be allocated to the segment and 
assess its performance, andC. For which discrete financial information is available.5.  Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptionsThe  preparation  of  the  Group’s  consolidated  financial  statements  require  management  to 
make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, 
expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the 
reporting period. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result 
in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability 
affected in future periods. 
 
(1)  JudgmentIn the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the 
following judgments, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized 
in the consolidated financial statements: 
 
A. Investment propertiesCertain properties of the Bank comprise a portion that is held to earn rentals or for 
capital  appreciation  and  another  portion  that  is  owner-occupied.  The  property  is 
classified  as  investment  property  in  its  entirety  only  if  the  portion  that  is  owner-
occupied is under 5% of the total property.B. Operating lease commitment－the Group as the lessorThe Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property 
portfolio.  The  Group  has  determined,  based  on  an  evaluation  of  the  terms  and 
conditions of the arrangements, that it retains all the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership of these properties and accounts for the contracts as operating leases.(2)  Estimates and assumptionsThe  key  assumptions  concerning  the  future  and  other  key  sources  of  estimation 
uncertainty  at  the  reporting  date,  that  have  a  significant  risk  of  causing  a  material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year 
are discussed below:301A. Impairment losses on loans and receivablesThe accounting policies from 1 January 2018 are as follows:The estimate of impairment losses on loans and receivables of the Group is measuredby the amount of expected credit losses during the remaining term to maturity. Underthe contract, the present  value of the difference between the contractual cash flow(carrying  amount)  and  the  expected  cash  flow  (assessment  of  prospectiveinformation) is credit loss, which is measured by the undiscounted difference in casethat the impact from discounting of short-term loans and receivables is insignificant.When the future actual cash flow is less than expection, it may result in significantimpairment loss. Please refer to note 12 for further details.The accounting policies before 1 January 2018 as follow:The Group review their loans and receivables to assess whether an impairment lossshould be recorded in profit or loss on a monthly basis. When the Group determineswhether to recognize impairment losses, they mainly decide if there is any observableevidence  indicating  possible  impairment.  The  evidence  may  include  observableinformation indicating unfavorable changes in debtor payment status, or sovereignor the local economic situation related to debt payment. While analysing expectedcash flow, the estimates by the management are based on past losses experience onthe  assets  of  similar  credit  risk  characteristics.  The  Group  periodically  reviewsmethods and assumptions behind the amount and schedule of expected cash flow, toreduce the difference between expected and actual loss.B. Fair value of financial instrumentsWhere the fair value of financial instruments cannot be derived from an active marketor a quoted price, it is determined using a valuation technique. Observable marketdata for similar financial instruments  is utilized as inputs to  measure fair value.  Ifobservable inputs are not available, prudent assumptions are used for estimating fairvalue.  In  applying  valuation  techniques,  the  Group  adopts  pricing  models  inaccordance with its procedure for valuation. All models are adjusted to ensure thattheir results reflect actual data and market prices.302C. Impairment of non-financial assetsImpairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds 
its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its 
value in use. The fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on available data 
from  binding  sales  transactions  in  an  arm’s  length  transaction  of  similar  assets  or 
observable market prices less incremental costs that would be directly attributable to 
the disposal of the asset or cash generating unit. The value in use calculation is based 
on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows projections are derived from the 
budget  for  the  next  five  years  and  do  not  include  restructuring  activities  that  the 
Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the 
asset’s performance of the cash generating unit being tested. The recoverable amount 
is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well 
as  the  expected  future  cash-inflows  and  the  growth  rate  used  for  extrapolation 
purposes. 
 
The  Bank  determines  whether  goodwill  is  impaired  on  an  annual  basis  and  when 
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  may  be  impaired.  This  requires  an 
estimation  of  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  CGU  or  groups  of  CGUs  to  which 
goodwill is allocated. Estimating the recoverable amount requires the Bank to make 
an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGU or groups of CGUs and 
also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those 
cash flows.D. Award credits deferred incomeThe accounting policies from 1 January 2018 are as follows: 
 
As to customer loyalty program, the bank recognizes the fair values of all the relative 
consideration received and receivable, and also evaluates the cost and the liabilities 
might  derive  from  award  credits  and  other  consideration. The  revenue  belongs  to 
award credits would be deferred and recognized as contract liabilities. It would be 
recognized as revenue only when the obligation  of the bank is  fulfilled. As points 
issued  under  the  program  do  not  expire,  such  estimates  are  subject  to  significant 
uncertainty. 
 
The accounting policies before 1 January 2018 as follow: 
 
The  Bank  recognizes  the  fair  value  of  all  considerations  received  or  receivable  as 
revenue at the time of sale, and estimates the cost and related liabilities resulting from 
the awards given. The consideration allocated to the award credits should be deferred 
and only recognized as revenue when award credits are redeemed and the Bank fulfils 
its obligations to supply awards. As points issued under the program do not expire, 
such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.303E. Income taxUncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations andthe  amount  and  timing  of  future  taxable  income.  Given  the  wide  range  of 
international  business  relationships  and  the  long-term  nature  and  complexity  of 
existing contractual  agreements, differences arising between the actual results and 
the  assumptions  made,  or  future  changes  to  such  assumptions,  could  necessitatefuture  adjustments  to  tax  income  and  expense  already  recorded.  The  Group 
establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of 
audits  by  the  tax  authorities  of  the  respective  counties  in  which  it  operates.  The 
amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previoustax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the 
responsible  tax  authority.  Such  differences  of  interpretation  may  arise  on  a  wide 
variety  of  issues  depending  on  the  conditions  prevailing  in  the  respective  Group 
entity’s domicile.Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognized  for  all  carry  forward  of  unused  tax  losses  and 
unused  tax  credits  and  deductible  temporary  differences  to  the  extent  that  it  is 
probable that taxable profit will be available or there are sufficient taxable temporarydifferences  against  which  the  unused  tax  losses,  unused  tax  credits  or  deductible 
temporary differences can be utilized. The amount of deferred tax assets determined 
to be recognized is based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits 
and taxable temporary differences together with future tax planning strategies.F.  Pension benefitsThe cost of post-employment benefit and the present value of the pension obligationunder  defined  benefit  pension  plans  are  determined  using  actuarial  valuations. An 
actuarial  valuation  involves  making  various  assumptions.  These  include  the 
determination of the discount rate and future salary increases.According to internal regulation of the Bank or hiring agreement, IAS 19 “Employee 
Benefit” applies to the excess interest of retiring employee preferential interest rate 
deposits once the employee is retired.G. Fair value of investment propertyThe fair value of investment property is derived from valuation techniques, including 
income  approach  (such  as  discounted  cash  flow  model  and  direct  capitalizationapproach), comparison approach, and  cost  approach,  while the assumptions used in 
applying  valuation  techniques  will  have  impacts  on  the  fair  value  of  investment 
property. Please refer Note 6.(13) for more details.3046.  Breakdown of Significant Accounts(1)  Cash and cash equivalentsCash on hand

$(3,777)A. As  of  31  December  2018  and  31  December  2017,  no  investment  property  waspledged.B. The Bank appointed appraisers from REPro Valuation and Professional Services (Fu-
Xue Shi, Zhi-Hao Wu, Hong-Xu Wu, You-Xiang Cai) to evaluate the fair value of 
investment property at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, respectively.Fair value has been supported by observable evidences in the market. The appraisal 
approaches  used  are  mainly  the  income  approach  (such  as  discounted  cash  flow 
model  and  direct  capitalization  approach),  sales  comparison  approach  and  cost 
approach, etc. 
 
(A)  Office building has market liquidity and their rent levels are more comparable 
with  similar  items  from  the  same  neighborhood.  The  fair  value  has  been 
determined by comparison approach and income approach.Net rental income is based on the current market practices, assuming an annual 
rent  increase  of  between  0%  to  1.5%  to  extrapolate  the  total  income  of  the 
underlying property, excluding losses as a result of idle and other reasons and 
related operation costs. 
 
According  to  the  ROC  Real  Estate Appraisers Association  Gazette  No.5,  the 
house tax has been determined based on the reference tables of current  house 
values  assessed  for  each  city/county  to  estimate  the  total  current  house  value 
assessed. House tax is calculated based on the tax rates provided by the House 
Tax Act and the actual payment date.316Land  value  tax  is  based  on  the  changes  in  the  announced  land  values  of  the 
underlying property in the past few years and the actual payment data, to further 
extrapolate the announced land value in the future. 
 
The  replacement  allowance  is  calculated  renovation  cost  base  on  15% 
construction cost, presume the useful life of 20 years, according to the ROC Real 
Estate Appraisers Association Gazette No.5, the replacement allowance is based 
on 0.5% to 1.5% of construction or building cost.

  1.98%-5.73% 
  0.76%-2.89%(B)  The fair value has been determined by the method of land development analysis 
and  comparison.  Reserved  area  in  hillside  land,  Scenic  land  site,  areas  for 
agriculture, animal husbandry and forestry had fewer market transactions as their 
uses are restricted by law, and will not have significant changes in the market in 
the near year.Rate of return

A. Key  assumptions  used  in  recoverable  amount  calculations  of  the  cash-generatingunit:The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit has been determined based on 
value in use, using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the 
management of the Bank covering a five-year period.B. The calculation of value in use for the cash-generating unit is most sensitive to thefollowing assumptions:(A)  Discount ratesDiscount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to the 
unit. Discount rates are calculated by the Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM).(B)  Projected growth rates, used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period:Assumptions are based on published industry research.C. Sensitivity to changes in assumptions:The  Bank  believes  that  reasonable  possible  changes  in  key  assumptions  used  to

The Bank adopts a defined contribution plan in accordance with the Labor Pension Act 
of the R.O.C. Under the Labor Pension Act, the Bank will make monthly contributions 
of  no  less  than  6%  of  the  employees’  monthly  wages  to  the  employees’  individual 
pension accounts. The Bank has made monthly contributions of 6% of each individual 
employee’s salaries or wages to employees’ pension accounts. 
 
Expenses under the defined contribution plan for the years ended 31 December 2018 
and 2017 were $381,983 thousand and $331,604 thousand, respectively, and recorded 
as “Employee benefits expenses”. 
 
Defined benefit plan 
 
The Bank adopts a defined benefit plan in accordance with the Labor Standards Act of 
the R.O.C. The pension benefits are disbursed based on the units of service years and 
the average salaries in the last month of the service year. Two units per year are awarded 
for the first 15 years of services while one unit per year is awarded after the completion 
of the 15th year. The total units shall not exceed 45 units. Under the Labor Standards 
Act, the Bank contributes an amount equivalent to 2% of the employees’ total salaries 
and wages on a monthly basis to the pension fund deposited at the Bank of Taiwan in 
the name of the administered pension fund committee. Before the end of each year, the 
Bank assesses the balance in the designated labor pension fund. Based on Article 56 of 
Labor  Standards  Act  of  the  R.O.C.,  if  the  amount  is  inadequate  to  pay  pensions 
calculated for workers retiring in the same year, the Bank will make up the difference 
in one appropriation before the end of March the following year. 
 
The Ministry of Labor is in charge of establishing and implementing the fund utilization 
plan  in  accordance  with  the  Regulations  for  Revenues,  Expenditures,  Safeguard  and 
Utilization of the Labor Retirement Fund.    The pension fund is invested in-house or 
under  mandation,  based  on  a  passive-aggressive  investment  strategy  for  long-term 
profitability. 
  The  Ministry  of  Labor  establishes  checks  and  risk  management 
mechanism based on the assessment of risk factors including market risk, credit risk and 
liquidity  risk,  in  order  to  maintain  adequate  manager  flexibility  to  achieve  targeted 
return without over-exposure of risk.    With regard to utilization of the pension fund, 
the minimum earnings in the annual distributions on the final financial statement shall 
not be less than the earnings attainable from the amounts accrued from two-year time 
deposits with the interest rates offered by local banks.    Treasury Funds can be used to 
cover the deficits after the approval  of the  competent authority. The  Bank expects  to 
contribute $196,937 thousand to its defined benefit plan during the 12 months beginning 
after 31 December 2018. 
 
As of 31 December 2018 and 2017, the Bank expects its defined benefits plan obligation

The methodologies and  assumptions used by the Group to  estimate the above fairvalue of financial instruments are summarized as follows:(A)  The carrying value of short-term  financial instruments, such as  cash  and cash 
equivalents,  receivables,  securities  purchased  under  agreements  to  resell, 
securities sold  under agreements to  repurchase, payables, refundable deposits, 
guarantee deposits, borrowed funds, due from the Central Bank and call loans to 
banks  and  due  to  the  Central  Bank  and  call  loans  from  banks  arising  in  the 
ordinary course of business, approximate the fair value because of the relatively 
short period of time between their origination and expected realization.(B)  Quoted market prices, if available, are utilized as estimates of the fair values of 
financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss financial assets at fair value 
through other comprehensive income, available-for-sale financial instruments, debt 
instrument  investment  at  amortized  cost  held-to-maturity  financial  assets, 
purchase of foreign exchange, debt instrument investment without active market. 
If no quoted market prices exist for certain financial instruments, the fair value 
of such instruments has been derived based on pricing models. A price model 
incorporates all factors that market participants would consider in setting a price. 
The discounted cash flow technique is used to estimate the fair value of a debt 
instrument where an active market does not exist. The estimates, hypotheses and 
discount rates for valuation refer to quoted prices, from financial instruments, of 
financial  instruments  having  substantially  the  same  terms  and  characteristics, 
including  the  credit  quality  of  debtors,  the  remaining  term  over  which  the 
contractual  interest  rate  is  fixed,  the  remaining  term  to  repayment  of  the 
principal, and the currency in which the payments are to be made.353(C)  Discounts  and  loans,  deposits,  financial  debentures  payable  and  principalsreceived from  the sale of structured products  are classified as interest-bearingfinancial instruments. Thus, their carrying value is equivalent to their fair value.The  face  value  of  delinquent  accounts  deducted  from  allowance  for  doubtfulaccounts is adopted as fair value.(D)  The fair value of financial debentures payable which designated as at fair valuethrough profit or loss is estimated by discounting future cash flows using ratescurrently available for debt on similar terms and remaining maturities.(E)  If the derivatives do not have market prices available to compare, the discounted-cash-  flow  model  is  applied  to  forward  currency  and  interest  rate  swap  andBlack-Scholes model, Binomial Option Price model or Monte-Carlo-method areapplied to option derivatives.(F)  The  Bank  adopts  the  exchange  rates  and  market  interest  rates  provide  byThomson  Reuters’  system  to  evaluate  the  fair  value  of  forward  currency,currency swap, interest rate swap and cross currency swap. The average price orclosing price is used to figure the fair value of each contract.(G)  Under  the  assumption  that  the  Bank  will  not  default,  the  Bank  determines  itscredit  value  adjustment  by  multiplying  three  factors,  probability  of  default(“PD”),  loss  given  default  (“LGD”),  and  exposure  at  default  (“EAD”)  of  thecounterparty. On the other hand, under the assumption that the counterparty willnot default, the Bank calculates its debit value adjustments by multiplying threefactors, PD, LGD, and EAD of the Bank.The estimated exposure at default for current period is evaluated by consideringthe fair value of the derivative instruments traded at OTC.The Bank sets estimated LGD at 60 % for most of the counterparties, but mayapply other assumptions when risk character and data are available.The Bank has considered the adjustment of credit risk in the calculation of thefair  value  of  financial  instruments  to  reflect  credit  risk  and  credit  quality  ofcounterparty and the Bank, respectively.354(2)  The fair value hierarchy information of the financial instrumentsA. The definition of the hierarchy of the financial instruments is measured at fair value:1st Level:  Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets orliabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.2nd Level: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect onthe recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.3rd Level: Techniques  which  use  inputs  which  have  a  significant  effect  on  therecorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial statement on a recurring 
basis,  the  bank  determines  whether  transfers  have  occurred  between  levels  in  the 
hierarchy by re-assessing categorization at the end of each reporting period.B. The  Group  measures  financial  instruments  and  investment  properties  based  on 
recurring basis, and assets held for sale are measured on the lower of non-recurring 
basis and fair value minus cost of goods sold. The Group’s fair value hierarchy is 
described as follows:2018.12.312nd Level3rd Level1st Level$3,657

meet  the  criteria  for  full  removal  are  mostly  made  up  of  debt  securities  used  as 
counterparty collateral for repurchase agreements or equity securities lent out as part 
of securities lending agreement. The nature of these transactions are secured loans, 
and reflects the liability where the Bank are obligated to repurchase the transferred 
financial  assets  according  to  a  fixed  price  in  future  periods.  With  respect  to  such 
transactions, the Bank will not be able to use, sell or pledge such transferred financial 
assets during the effective period.    However the Bank is still exposed to interest rate 
risk and credit risk, hence they are not removed.359The following table analyses financial assets and financial liabilities that have not

executed  enforceable  master  netting  arrangement  or  other  similar  agreements  with 
counterparties. Financial instruments subject to enforceable master netting arrangement 
or  other  similar  agreements  could  be  settled  at  net  amount  as  chosen  by  the 
counterparties,  or  the  financial  instruments  could  be  settled  at  gross  amount  if  not.   
However, if one of the counterparty defaults, the other party could choose to settle the 
transaction at net amount.360Information related to offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities is disclosed

In order to comply withthe  above  requirements,  the  Bank  adopted  different  risk  management  methods  toidentify its risks and the Bank followed the spirit and regulation of the “Basel Accord”to keep strengthening its assets and the practices of capital management to maintain thebest capital adequacy ratio.The  Bank  organized  the  risk  management  committee  and  its  responsibilities  areillustrated as below:A. To amend the risk management policies, risk appetite or risk tolerance and report theabove issues to board of directors for approval.B. To  manage  and  decide  the  strategy  about  the  Bank’s  credit  risk,  market  risk  andoperational risk management.C. To  report  the  significant  risk  management  issues,  such  as  credit  ratings,  marketassessment and risk indicators.D. To analyze the issues that the Bank’s business unit brought up for discussion.E. Other issues.The Bank organized a risk management group to monitor, lead, develop, and establishthe integral risk management framework.(6)  Market riskMarket risk is the potential loss arising from adverse movements of market price, suchas interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity securities.The Bank organized market risk management department and the committee of assetsand liabilities management is responsible for monitoring the market risk management.The department and committee periodically examine the Bank’s structure of assets andliabilities; plan the pricing principle of deposit and loan and financing and using schemeof  medium  and  long  term  funding  while  executing  the  market  risk  management,  themarket  risk  management  department  periodically  provides  the  related  information  ofmanagement and reports to the authorized managers of the Bank for the managementsystem, such as valuating position, risk limit management, calculating of profit and loss,pricing model and risk analysis, in order to control the overall market risk.362Market risk management processA. Identification and measurementThe operations department and risk management department of the Bank identifiedthe  market  risk  factors  of  risk  exposure  position,  and  measured  the  market  riskfurther. Market risk factors are the components that could have an impact on valueof  financial  instrument,  such  as  interest  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates,  equitysecurities…etc., including position, gain and loss, the loss of stress test, sensitivity(DV01, Delta, Vega, Gamma) and Value at Risk (VaR)…etc., to measure the extentof investment portfolio that is influenced by interest risk, foreign exchange risk andequity securities.B. Monitoring and reportingThe risk management department periodically  reports the execution of market riskmanagement  target,  position  and  gain/loss  control,  sensitivity  analysis,  stress  test,and VaR of equity securities to the board of directors, and helps the board of directorsto fully understand the status of market risk management. The Bank also establishesa clear reporting process. Each transaction has the requirements about limitation andstop-loss points. If the transaction reaches its stop-loss limitation, stop-loss processwill be implemented immediately.  If the stop-loss process is not implemented, thetransaction department should document the reason of non-implementing stop lossprocess  and  responding  plan.  Furthermore,  the  department  shall  report  to  theexecutive management for approval and report to the board of directors regularly.Risk management policy of the trading bookThe trading book is the portfolio of financial instruments and physical investment forthe purpose of trading or the hedge on the trading book. Portfolio is held for trading,which is intended to earn the profit from bid-ask spread. Any positions aside from theabove trading book will be in the banking book.A. StrategyIn  order  to  control  market  risk  effectively  and  ensure  flexibility  in  operating  thetransaction  strategy,  the  Bank  carries  out  various  assessment  and  control.  Theportfolio of trading book has the risk limitation of each investment portfolio whichis  set  according  to  the  transaction  strategy,  category  of  investment  and  the  annualprofit target.363B. Policy and procedureThe  Bank  sets  the  “Regulation  Governing  of  Market  Risk  Management”  as  the 
important regulation that should be complied with when holding trading portfolio.C. Valuation policyIf  the  financial  instruments  of  trading  book  have  market  values,  they  should  be 
evaluated  at  least  once  each  day  by  the  information  that  is  from  an  independent 
source  and  easily  accessible.  If  it’s  evaluated  by  a  model,  a  mathematical  model 
should be used prudently, and the assumptions and parameters of the valuation model 
should be regularly reviewed and examined.D. Method of measurement(A)  The assumption and calculation of VaR: see VaR section. 
(B)  The  Bank  executes  the  stress  test  monthly  with  the  following  scenarios:  the 
fluctuation  of  interest  rate  at  100bp,  equity  securities  at  15%  and  foreign 
exchange rate at 3%, and reports to the risk management committee regularly.Interest risk management of trading book 
 
A. Definition of interest riskInterest risk is the risk that the trading portfolios suffer losses or the change of its fair 
value  which  is  caused  by  the  fluctuation  of  interest  rate.  The  main  instruments 
include the securities and derivatives that relate to interest rates.B. Interest risk management procedure of trading bookThe  Bank  prudently  choose  its  investment  target  by  studying  the  credibility  and 
financial  position  of  the  securities  issuers,  their  sovereign  risk  and  the  trend  of 
interest  rates.  According  to  the  operating  strategy  and  the  circumstances  of  the 
market, the Bank sets the transaction limit and stop-loss limit (including the limits of 
dealing room, traders, and investment…etc.) of the trading book that are reported to 
the executive management or the board of directors for approval.C. Method of measurement(A)  The assumption and calculation of VaR: see VaR section. 
(B)  The Bank measures the investment portfolio’s interest risk exposure monthly.364Interest risk management of banking book 
 
The main objective of interest risk management of the banking book is to enhance the 
interest risk management, increase the operating efficiency of the fund and strengthen 
the business operation.   
 
A. StrategyInterest  risk  management  enhances  the  Bank’s  ability  take  responsive  actions  to 
measure, to manage and avoid the risk that the fluctuation of interest rate may cause 
on the profit and the economic value of assets/liabilities.B. Management procedureWhen  undertaking  the  operations  relating  to  interest  rate  instruments,  the  Bank 
identifies the repricing risk of interest rate, yield curve risk, basis risk and options 
risk  characteristics.  In  additional,  the  Bank  also  measures  the  potential  impact  of 
interest  rate  changes  on  the  profit  and  economic  value  of  the  Bank.  The  Bank 
analyzes  and  monitors  the  interest  risk  limits  and  each  target  of  interest  risk 
management monthly. The results of analysis and monitoring are regularly reported 
to not only the risk management committee but also the board of directors. 
 
If any risk management targets is  found to  exceed the limit during the monitoring 
process, it will be reported to the risk management committee and a solution should 
be proposed.C. Method of measurementThe interest risk of the Bank mainly measures the repricing risk that is caused by the 
difference between maturity date and repricing date of the assets, liabilities, and off 
balance sheet items in banking book. To stabilize long-term profitability and ensure 
business  growth,  the  Bank  sets  the  monitoring  indicators  of  interest  sensitivity  in 
major terms and implements stress test. Each interest risk indicator and the result of 
stress test are reported to the executive management regularly for review.Foreign exchange risk management 
 
A. Definition of foreign exchange riskForeign exchange risk is the gain/loss caused by two currencies exchange at different 
times. The Bank’s foreign exchange risk arises from the derivative instruments, such 
as spot exchange, forward exchange and foreign exchange option…etc. The Bank’s 
foreign exchange transactions are implemented daily to offset clients’ position. Thus, 
the Bank suffers little foreign exchange risk.365B. Policy,  procedure  and  measurement  methodology  of  foreign  exchange  riskmanagementIn order to control foreign exchange risk, the Bank sets the limits of transaction andstop-loss limits for the dealing room and traders. Meanwhile, the Bank also sets themaximum annual  loss limit  to control the loss within  the tolerable extent. Foreignexchange risk is controlled based on VaR. The assumption and calculation of VaR isdescribed in VaR section.For foreign exchange risk, the Bank sets the scenario at 3% fluctuation  of interestrate of major currencies  to  execute the stress  test quarterly, and reports to  the riskmanagement committee.Risk management of equity securities priceA. Definition of risk of equity securities priceThe  market  risk  of  equity  securities  held  by  the  Bank  includes  the  individual  riskfrom the fluctuation of individual equity securities’ market price and general marketrisk from the fluctuation of the overall price trend.B. Purpose of risk management in equity securities pricesTo  avoid  the  massive  fluctuation  of  equity  securities  price  to  worsen  the  Bank’sfinancial situation or earnings. Also, to raise the operating efficiency of capital andstrengthen the business operation.C. Procedure of risk management of equity securities pricesThe  Bank  sets  investment  limit  on  industries,  using  the  β  value  to  measure  theinvestment portfolio affected by the systemic risk monthly. The stop-loss point mustbe  authorized  by  the  board  of  directors,  and  the  equity  investment  should  beauthorized by the executives if the stop-loss point is reached but the investment isnot going to be disposed of.D. Measured methodologyThe risk of equity securities prices in trading book is mainly controlled by VaR.The Bank’s risk of equity securities prices from its non-trading portfolio should becontrol by each bank according to its own business scale to develop a stress test underappropriate scenarios and report to the risk management committee.366The Bank adopts many methodologies to manage its market risk. Value-at-risk (VaR)is one of the methodologies. VaR is a statistical measure that assesses potential lossesthat might be caused by changes in risk factors over a specified period of time and ata specific level of statistical confidence. The Bank applies historical simulation witha  statistic  confidence  of  99%  to  extrapolate  the VaR  of  one-year  fluctuations. Thefollowing form indicates the VaR which is the estimation of potential amount of losswithin  one  day.  While  the  statistic  confidence  of  99%  represents  the  possiblefluctuations that would be included in assumed adverse market changes. Base on theassumption, the VaR may exceed the amounts listed in 1 of 100 days due to the pricechanges in the market. The overall VaR in the market may be less than the aggregateVaR of individual market risk factors.2018.12.31Factors of marketMaximumrisk(Note)Average balancebalanceMinimum balanceInterest rateForeign exchangeEquity securities price$307,882147,353318,530$701,219202,948424,067$52,816104,364230,176Factors of marketMaximumrisk(Note)Average balancebalanceMinimum balance2017.12.31Interest rateForeign exchangeEquity securities price$569,756252,124232,500$858,800554,769303,251$273,155115,940165,345Note:  The  information  of  factors  of  market  risk  is  defined  by  risk  managementpolicy of the trading book.The Bank enters into a variety of derivatives transactions for both trading and non-
trading  purposes.  The  objectives  in  using  derivative  instruments  are  to  meet

A. Interest rate riskInterest  rate  factor  sensitivities  (the  present  value  of  one  basis  point,  or  “PVBP”) 
represent the change in the net present value of the interest rate derivatives portfolios 
caused by a parallel unit shift of 0.01% (1 basis point) in the interest rates in various 
yield  curves  affecting  the  portfolio.  The  Bank’s  interest  rate-sensitive  portfolios 
include  bonds,  interest  rate  swaps  and  structured  products  composed  of  such 
products.B. Foreign exchange riskForeign exchange rate factor sensitivities (“FX delta”) represent the change of the 
foreign  exchange  portfolios  caused  by  the  underlying  currency  exchange  rate 
fluctuation.368C. Equity securities price riskEquity securities price factor sensitivities (“Equity delta”) represent the  change of 
the equity securities price portfolio caused by a parallel unit shift of 1% (100 basis 
points)  in  the  underlying  stocks  prices  fluctuation.  The  Bank’s  equity  partfolios 
include stocks and equity index options.2018.12.31Sensitivity ofForeign exchange rate factor sensitivity (FX Delta)Interest rate factor sensitivity (PVBP)Equity securities price factor sensitivity (Equity Delta)Foreign exchange rate factor sensitivity (FX Delta)USD+1%

The Bank, Indovina Bank and CUBCN Bank 
 
To  centralize  risk  management  functions  currently  handled  by  different 
departments,  the  Bank,  Indovina  Bank  and  CUBCN  Bank  board  of  directors 
resolved that a risk management department would be established to manage the 
credit  risk.  The  objectives  of  a  credit  risk  management  are  to  improve  asset 
quality  and  to  generate  stable  profits  while  reducing  risk  through  a  diversified 
and balanced loan portfolio. The Bank, Indovina Bank and CUBCN Bank board 
of directors sets the counterparty credit limits, which are then implemented by 
the credit committee. The credit committee also monitors current and potential 
credit  exposure  to  individual  counterparties  and  on  an  aggregate  basis  to 
counterparties and their affiliates. The Bank and Indovina Bank perform periodic 
and systematic detailed reviews of its lending portfolios to identify credit risks 
and to assess the overall collectability of those portfolios.The  Bank,  Indovina  Bank  and  CUBCN  Bank  maintain  a  strict  policy  to  evaluatecustomers’ credit ratings when providing loan commitments and commercial letters ofcredit transactions. Certain customers are required to provide appropriate collateral forthe related loans, and the Bank, Indovina Bank and CUBCN Bank retains the legal rightto  foreclose  on  or  liquidate  the  collateral.  The  disclosure  of  the  maximum  creditexposure shall not take account of any collateral held or other enhancements.CUBC BankThe CUBC Bank board of directors resolved that a risk management department 
would be established to manage the credit risk. The CUBC Bank board of directors 
sets the counterparty credit limits, which are then implemented by the credit committee.Loan Committee is the top lending authority within the CUBC bank. It is in chargedwith  approval  of  all  credit  in  excess  of  CUBC  Bank  lending  authorities.  Certaincustomers are required to provide appropriate collateral for the related loans, and theCUBC  Bank  retains  the  legal  right  to  foreclose  on  or  liquidate  the  collateral.  Thedisclosure of the maximum credit exposure shall not take account of any collateral heldor other enhancements.The management procedure and measurement methodology of credit risk in the Bank’smain business are as follows:370The judgement of significant increase in credit risk after the initial recognitionThe Bank and CUBCN BankThe Bank and CUBCN Bank assesses the movement in default risk during the expectedlifetime of various types of credit assets at each reporting date to determine if the creditrisk has increased significantly since the initial recognition. To make this assessment,the  Group  has  considered  to  show  the  reasonable  and  corroborative  information(including prospective information) on the significant  increase in  credit risk after theinitial recognition. The key indicators for consideration include:A.Quantitative indicators(A)  Changes on credit ratingWhen  the  credit  rating  at  the  reporting  date  has  decreased  to  some  extentcompared with that on initial recognition and the credit rating has not met theinvestment  grade  (i.e.  the  credit  rating  is  lower  than  the  credit  rating  Baa3  ofMoody's, an international credit rating agency), it is determined that the creditrisk has increased significantly since the initial recognition.(B)  Information on the overdue status of the contractWhen  the  contract  payment  was  overdue  for  more  than  30  days  as  at  thereporting  date,  it  is  determined  that  the  credit  risk  has  increased  significantlysince the initial recognition.B. Qualitative indicatorsWhen the information observed at the reporting date meets the following conditions,it  is  determined  that  the  credit  risk  has  increased  significantly  since  the  initialrecognition.(A)  The refund records are reported(B)  Accountants have expressed significant doubt on its ability to continue as a goingconcern(C)  Other internal or external information on judging the credit quality changes371Indovina Bank 
 
The  Indovina  Bank  assesses  the  movement  in  default  risk  during  the  expected 
lifetime of various types of finacial assets at each reporting date to determine if 
the credit risk has increased significantly since the initial recognition:A.  Notch downgradeA notch downgrade of obligor’s internal or external ratings between the current grade 
and the grade at initial recognition greater than specific threshold would be classified 
as a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.B.  Low credit risk criteriaAn exposure rated below Moody’s investment grade at the reporting date would be 
classified as a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.C.  Past Due InformationD.The  contract  payment  over  30  days  past  due  would  be  classified  as  a  significant 
increase in credit risk since initial recognition. 
Internal Credit Assessment Indicators 
The  indicators  with  credit  quality  information  that  is  weaker  than  upon  initial 
recognition  would  be  classified  as  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  since  initial 
recognition.CUBC Bank 
 
The  CUBC  Bank  assesses  the  movement  in  default  risk  during  the  expected 
lifetime of various types of finacial assets at each reporting date to determine if 
the credit risk has increased significantly since the initial recognitionA. Past Due InformationThe  contract  payment  over  30  days  past  due  would  be  classified  as  a  significant 
increase in credit risk since initial recognition.B. Loan Classification from NBCA loan contract with special mention position at reporting date would be classified 
as a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.C. Internal Credit Assessment IndicatorsThe  indicators  with  credit  quality  information  that  is  weaker  than  upon  initial 
recognition  would  be  classified  as  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  since  initial 
recognition.Default and credit impairement of financial asset 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank definition of default on financial assets is the same with 
the one of judging the credit impairement of financial assets. Where one or more of the 
following conditions are met, the Bank determines the financial assets to be subject to 
default and credit impairement.372A. Quantitative indicator(A)  Changes on credit ratingWhen  the  credit  rating  at  the  reporting  date  fell  into  the  default  level,  it  is 
determined as credit impairement.(B)  Information on the overdue status of the contractWhen the contract payment was overdue for more than 90 days as at the reporting 
date, it is determined as credit impairement.B. Qualitative indicatorWhen the information observed at the reporting date meets the following conditions, 
it is determined as credit impairement. 
 
(A)  Bailout,  reorganization,  individual  agreement  due  to  debtor’s  financialdifficulties(B) Lawsuit action has been taken 
(C)  Debt settlement, debt negotiation 
(D)  Issuer  or  borrower  has  gone  bankrupt  or  may  file  for  bankruptcy  or  financialreorganization(E)  Principal or interest failed to be paid according to the issuing terms 
(F)  Other  internal  or  external  information  on  judging  the  deterioration  in  creditqualityThe  aforementioned  definition  of  default  and  credit  impairment  applies  to  all 
financial assets held by the Bank, and is consistent with the definition applied on the 
significant financial assets for the purpose of internal credit risk management, and is 
also applied in the relevant impairment assessment model.Indovina Bank 
 
The  Indovina  Bank  assesses  the  movement  in  default  risk  during  the  expected 
lifetime of various types of finacial assets at each reporting date to determine if 
the credit risk subjected to default:A. Notch downgradeAn obligor who has failed to pay one or more of its financial obligations or is rated 
as default at the reporting date is considered to be credit-impaired.B. Past Due InformationThe contract payment over 90 days past due would be classified as a credit-impaired 
loan.C. Internal Credit Assessment IndicatorsThe  indicators  with  credit  deterioration  information  used  for  internal  credit  risk 
management purpose at the reporting date would be recognized as credit-impaired 
assets.373CUBC Bank 
 
The  CUBC  Bank  assesses  the  movement  in  default  risk  during  the  expected 
lifetime of various types of finacial assets at each reporting date to determine if 
the credit risk subjected to default:A. Past Due InformationThe contract payment over 90 days past due would be classified as a credit-impaired 
loan.B. Loan Classification from NBCA  loan  contract  with  specific  positions,  such  as  substandard,  doubtful  and  loss,  at 
reporting date would be classified as a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition.C. Internal Credit Assessment IndicatorsThe  indicators  with  credit  deterioration  information  used  for  internal  credit  risk 
management purpose at the reporting date would be recognized as credit-impaired 
assets.The measurement of expected credit loss 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank 
 
For  the  purpose  of  assessing  the  expected  credit  losses,  the  Bank  and  CUBCN  Bank 
classify the credit assets into the following groups based on credit category, credit rating, 
risk characteristics, enterprise size, product category and so on. 
 
Credit category  Definition 
Enterprise loan  Grouped by risk characteristics, enterprise size and internal/external credit rating 
Consumer loan  Grouped by product category and internal credit rating 
Credit card 
Grouped by product category and internal credit rating 
 
When the credit risk of the financial instrument has not increased significantly after the 
initial recognition (Stage 1), the allowance for losses should be measured at the expected 
credit losses over 12 months by the Bank and CUBCN Bank. When the credit risk of 
the financial instrument has increased significantly (Stage 2) or the credit impairment 
has  existed  (Stage  3)  after  the  initial  recognition,  the  allowance  for  losses  should  be 
measured at the expected credit losses over the life time by the Bank and CUBCN Bank.   
 
For the measurement of the expected credit losses, the Bank and CUBCN Bank calculate 
its expected credit losses over 12 months and the life time respectively by multiplying 
three factors, i.e. probability of default (“PD”), loss given default (“LGD”) and exposure 
at  default  (“EAD”)  of  the  borrower  over  the  next  12  months  and  the  life  time,  also 
considering the effect of the life time value of money.374The PD and  LGD applied in  the impairment  assessment of the credit business  of theBank and CUBCN Bank are adjusted and calculated based on the internal and externalinformation  of  each  group  as  well  as  the  currently  observable  data  and  the  forward-looking macroeconomic information    (such as economic growth rate, etc.).The Bank and CUBCN Bank assessed the EAD of loan at the reporting date. Accordingto  internal  and  external  information,  the  Bank  considers  the  portion  of  the  loancommitment that is expected to be drawn on over 12 months after the reporting date andthe lifetime, to determine the EAD for calculating the expected credit losses.The  PD  used  in  the  impairment  assessment  of  the  Bank  and  CUBCN  Bank  debtinstrument measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and measuredat amortized cost, represents the PD of the issuer, guarantee agency or borrower. TheLGD represents the loss rate resulted from the default of the issuer, guarantee agency orborrower.  The  LGD  used  in  the  Bank  and  CUBCN  Bank  relevant  impairmentassessment is based on the information regularly published by Moody's, an internationalcredit rating agency; the PD is based on the information regularly published by TaiwanRatings  and  Moody's,  and  calculated  after  adjusting  the  historical  data  based  on  thecurrently  observable  data  and  the  looking-forward  macroeconomic  information  (eg,gross domestic product and economic growth rate, etc.). The EAD is measured at theamortized cost of financial assets and interests receivable.The valuation  techniques or significant  assumptions for assessing the expected creditlosses have no significant change in 2018.Indovina BankIndovida  Bank  has  grouped  their  exposures  on  the  basis  of  shared  credit  riskcharacteristic, including product and counterparty types as follows.CategoryDescriptionLoan portfolio  Grouped by  product  class,  counterparty  type  and  enterprise  size,  such  as largecorporate, SME and retail loans.Bond portfolioGrouped by product class, external credit rating and payment ranks, such assovereign and corporate bonds.375A. Loan portfolioThe  segmentation  of  the  Indovina  bank’s  loan  portfolio  is  based  on  its  risk 
characteristics,  such  as  product  class,  counterparty  type  and  enterprise  size.  The 
measurement of expected credit loss is estimated by three main parameters, including 
probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. The probability of 
default  and  loss  given  default  were  built  by  the  bank’s  historical  delinquent 
information and recovery data and calibrated by selected macroeconomic factors for 
forward-looking  adjustment.  The  estimated  amounts  of  exposure  at  default  were 
calculated by the amortized cost and interest receivable. At each financial reporting 
date, the above criteria for a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition 
are  not  hit,  the  allowance  loss  shall  be  measured  on  the  basis  of  the  12-month 
expected  credit  loss  method.  If  financial  assets  meet  the  foregoing  conditions  of 
significant increases in credit risk or credit deterioration since initial recognition, the 
allowance losses shall be estimated according to the respective methods on the basis 
of lifetime expected credit losses.B. Bond portfolioThe segmentation of the Indovina bank’s bond portfolio is based on its product class, 
external  rating  and  payment  rank.  The  measurement  of  expected  credit  loss  is 
estimated  by  three  main  parameters,  including  probability  of  default,  loss  given 
default and exposure at default. The probability of default and loss given default were 
built by external information with sufficient historical default data and recovery rates 
and calibrated by selected macroeconomic factors for forward-looking adjustment. 
The estimated amounts of exposure at default were calculated by the amortized cost 
and  interest  receivable.  At  each  financial  reporting  date,  the  above  criteria  for  a 
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are not hit, the allowance 
loss shall be measured on the basis of the 12-month expected credit loss method. If 
financial assets meet the foregoing conditions of significant increases in credit risk 
or  credit  deterioration  since  initial  recognition,  the  allowance  losses  shall  be 
estimated according to the respective methods on the basis of lifetime expected credit 
losses.Cathay United Bank Cambodia (CUBC)CUBC measures their expected credit losses by the following segments.Category

The measurementof expected credit loss is estimated by three main parameters, including probability ofdefault, loss given default and exposure at default. The probability of default and lossgiven default were built by the internal and external historical delinquent information,default rates and written-off amounts and calibrated by selected macroeconomic factorsfor  forward-looking  adjustment.  The  estimated  amounts  of  exposure  at  default  werecalculated by the amortized cost and interest receivable. At each financial reporting date,the above criteria for a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are nothit, the allowance loss shall be measured on the basis of the 12-month expected creditloss method. If financial assets meet the foregoing conditions of significant increases incredit risk or credit deterioration since initial recognition, the allowance losses shall beestimated according to the respective methods on the basis of lifetime expected creditlosses.Write-off policyIf any of the following conditions apply, the Group writes off its non-performing andnonaccrual loans as uncollectible, less the estimated recoverable amount.The  Group  can’t  expect  reasonably  to  collecte  the  financail  assets  that  including  thefollowing index:A. The recovery activity has stopped.B. Assessed the borrower doesn’t have sufficient assets or sources of income to pay theoverdraft.Financial assets have been written-off by the Group may still have ongoing recoveryactivity, and continue to follow the relevant policies to litigation proceedings.The consideration of forward-looking informationThe Bank and CUBCN BankThe Bank and CUBCN Bank use historical data to analyze and identify the significanteconomic factors that affect the credit risks and expected credit losses of each group ofassets, and use the regression model or imputation adjustment method to estimate theimpairment  parameter  after  the  prospective  adjustment.  The  significant  economicfactors  and  their  impact  on  PD  and  LGD  differ  depending  on  the  type  of  financialinstruments.377The significant economic factors identified by the Bank and CUBCN Bank in 2018 areas follows:Credit categoryProbability of Default (PD)Loss Given Default (LGD)GDP%Enterprise loanInflation IndexProportion of investment in GDP(%)Growth rate of GDP(%)Consumer loanProportion of savings in GDP(%)GDP%Unemployment rate %Implied Purchasing Power Parities(“PPP”) rateCredit cardGrowth rate of GDP(%)Proportion of government revenue in GDP(%)Indovina BankBased  on  the  qualitative  and  quantitative  analysis  of  historical  default  data  andmacroeconomic  factors,  the  Indovina  bank  applies  the  selected  local  and  globaleconomic  factors  in  different  portfolios.

Category of credit riskThe credit risk of the Bank was classified into five categories. Normal credit assetsshall be classified as “Category One.” The remaining unsound credit assets shall beevaluated based on the status of the loan collaterals and the length of time overdue.Assets that require special mention shall be classified as “Category Two,” assets thatare substandard shall be classified as “Category Three,” assets that are doubtful shallbe classified as “Category Four,” and assets for which there is loss shall be classifiedas  “Category  Five”.  For  managing  the  default  credits,  the  Bank  established  theregulations governing the procedure to deal with non-performing loans, non-accrualloans and bad debts.B. Grade of credit qualityThe  Bank  sets  the  level  of  credit  quality  based  on  the  characteristics  and  scale  ofbusiness  (such  as  establishing  the  internal  rating  model  of  credit  risk,  setting  thecredit rating table or relevant rules to classify) to proceed with risk management.In  order  to  measure  the  credit  risk  of  the  clients,  the  Bank  employs  the  statisticmethods  and  the  professional  judgment  from  the  experts.  The  Bank  develops  therating  model  of  business  credit  after  considering  the  clients’  relevant  information.The model shall be reviewed periodically to verify if the calculated results conformto the reality and revise every parameter to optimize the results.With respect to consumer credit assets such as mortgages, credit cards, and small-amount credit loans, the Bank also evaluates default risk of clients by using the creditrating scores developed by the Bank and the external due diligence services.The credit quality of the Bank’s corporate borrowers is classified as excellent, good,average, and bad.To ensure the reasonable estimated values of credit rating system’s design, process,and  relevant  risk  factors,  the  Bank  executes  the  relevant  verification  and  tests  themodel according to the actual default every year so that the calculated results will beclose to actual default.387The Bank evaluates the counterparties’ credit quality before transactions and refersto the domestic and foreign credit rating agencies, when rendering different lines ofcredit based on the credit quality.C. Hedge of credit risk and easing policy(A)  CollateralThe  Bank  adopts  a  series  of  policies  to  lower  the  credit  risk,  and  one  of  thefrequently-used  methods  is  requesting  borrowers  to  provide  collaterals.  Toensure the creditor’s rights, the Bank sets the scope available as collaterals andthe  procedures  of  appraising,  managing,  and  disposing  the  collaterals.  Inaddition,  a credit contract  is  in  place to  provide the credit claim  preservation,collaterals, and offset provisions to stipulate when a credit trigger event occurs,the Bank may reduce the limit, cut down the payback period, or deem all debtsmature. Also, the Bank will use the deposits that the borrowers saved in the Bankto offset the liabilities to lower the credit risk.Other non-credit business collaterals shall depend on the characteristics of thefinancial  instruments.  Only  the  asset-backed  securities  and  other  similarfinancial instruments are secured by an asset pool of financial instruments.(B)  Limit of credit risk and control of credit risk concentrationTo avoid the excessive risk concentration, the Bank limits the credit amounts ofsingle counterparties and groups; the Bank also sets the investment  guide andregulation of risk control of equity investment to restrict the investment limits ofsingle  person  (company)  or  related  company  (group).  Furthermore,  the  Bankestablishes relevant regulations to control the concentration risk of assets, andsets the credit limits by industry, group, country, and stock types to monitor thecredit concentration risk.(C)  Net settlement agreementThe  Bank  usually  settles  by  the  gross  balance,  but  signs  contract  with  somecounterparties to settle by net balance. If a default happens, the Bank will terminateall transactions with the counterparty and settle by net balance in order to lower thecredit risk.388D.

$-To reduce the risk from any businesses, the Bank conducts an overall assessment 
and takes appropriate risk reduction measures, such as obtaining collaterals and 
guarantors.  For  obtaining  of  collaterals,  the  Bank  has  Collateral  Management 
Guidelines, to ensure that collaterals meet the specific criteria and has the effect 
of reducing the business risk. 
 
The management deems the Group is able to control and minimize the credit risk 
exposures  in  off-balance-sheet  items  as  the  Group  uses  more  strict  rating 
procedures when extending credits and conduct reviews regularly.E. Credit concentration risk of the GroupWhen  the  counterparties  are  obviously  the  same  party,  or  there  are  several 
counterparties  but  engaging  in  similar  business  activities  and  sharing  similar 
economic  characteristics,  and  vulnerable  to  the  same  economic  impacts  or  other 
changes, the credit concentration risk is apparent. 
 
Credit  concentration  risk  of  the  Group  derives  from  the  assets,  liabilities  and  off-
balance-sheet  items,  and  arise  from  performing  obligations  or  engaging  in 
transactions or cross-line portfolio of risk exposures including credit extension, due 
from and call loans to other banks, securities investment, receivables and derivatives. 
The Group does not significantly concentrate on a single client or counterparty, and 
the transaction amount with a single client or counterparty accounted for the Bank’s 
total bills discounts and loans and overdue receivables is not significant. Discounts 
and  loans,  guarantees,  bills  purchased,  and  acceptances  receivable  of  the  Group

from the Central Bank and call loans to banks, financial assets at fair value through 
profit and loss, securities purchased under agreements to resell, refundable deposits, 
operating  deposits  and  settlement  fund,  are  excluded  from  this  analysis  since  the 
counterparty is normally with good credit quality and is considered as low credit risk.

Overview(A)  The capital management objectives of the Group are as follows:a.  The  eligible  capital  of  the  Group  must  conform  to  the  regulatory  capital 
requirements and achieve the minimum adequacy ratio. The calculation of the 
eligible capital and regulatory capital should follow the rules issued by the 
competent authority.b.  To ensure the Group possesses sufficient capital to assume various risk, the 
Group assesses required capital for the portfolios and characteristics of risk 
and  execute  risk  management  through  capital  allocation  to  realize 
optimization of resources.400B. Capital management procedures(A)  The Group follows the guides and the spirit established by the Basel Committeeon Banking Supervision, “The Banking Act of The Republic of China” and thelocal regulations governing the foreign operations to assess and monitoring thecapital adequacy ratio monthly. The information about capital adequacy ratio isreported to the competent authority quarterly.(B)  The  Group  maintains  the  BIS  (Bank  for  International  Settlement)  capitaladequacy ratio at 8%, the minimum standard set by the competent authority. Toimplement  capital  management,  the  Group  considers  not  only  the  businessdevelopment  but  also  the  revised  regulation  from  the  competent  authority,significant  fund  operations  and  capital  increase  plans  to  evaluate  the  capitaladequacy ratio. To enhance internal monitoring efficiency, the Bank establishedan  early-warning  mechanism  to  reduce  the  impact  of  significant  events,  tomaintain  the  capital  adequacy  ratio  and  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  the  capitalstructures.(C)  The risk management team is responsible for monitoring the regulatory capitalof the Group. The regulatory capital is divided into net Tier 1 Capital and netTier 2 Capital listed as follows:a.  Net Tier 1 Capital: The aggregate amount of net Common Equity Tier 1 andnet additional Tier 1 Capital.Net  common  equity  tier  1  capital:  Primarily  consists  of  common  equity  minusintangible  assets  (including  goodwill),  unamortized  losses  on  sales  of  non-performing loans, deferred tax assets due to losses from the previous year and otherstatutory adjustments.Net  additional  tier  1  capital:  Consists  of  the  aggregate  amount  of  non-cumulative  perpetual  preferred  stocks  and  non-cumulative  perpetualsubordinated debts, etc.b.  Net  Tier  2  Capital:  Consists  of  cumulative  perpetual  preferred  stocks,cumulative perpetual subordinated debts, revaluation increments, convertiblebonds, operating reserves and allowance for uncollectible accounts.401(D)  According  to  “Regulations  Governing  the  Capital  Adequacy  and  CapitalCategory of Banks”, terms of risk-weighted assets are defined as follows:a.  Total  Risk-weighted Assets:  The  sum  of  the  risk-weighted  assets  and  the 
capital requirements for market risk and operational risk multiplied by 12.5. 
Those assets already deducted from the regulatory capital, however, shall be 
deducted from the total risk-weighted assets.b.  Risk-weighted Assets  for Credit Risk: The measurement of the risk of loss 
caused by the counterparty’s default. This risk measurement is expressed as 
the total of each of the bank’s transaction items on and off the balance sheet 
times a risk weight.c.  The Capital Requirement for Market Risk: The capital required for assessed 
losses from the bank’s transaction items on and off the balance sheet arising 
from movements in market prices (interest  rates, exchange rates, and stock 
prices, etc.).d.  The Capital Requirement for Operational Risk: The capital required for the 
risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal process, people and 
systems or external events.C. Regulatory capital ratioPursuant  to  of  the  Banking Act,  the  ratio  of  a  bank’s  eligible  capital  to  its  risk-
weighted assets must not be lower than a certain ratio; if such ratio is lower than the 
prescribed ratio, the Bank’s ability to distribute cash earnings or repurchase its shares 
may be restricted by the regulatory.As of 31 December 2018 and    31 December 2017, the ratio of the Group eligible 
capital  to  its  consolidated  risk-weighted  assets  were  15.67%  and  15.78%, 
respectively.(10) Structured entitiesUnconsolidated structured entities
