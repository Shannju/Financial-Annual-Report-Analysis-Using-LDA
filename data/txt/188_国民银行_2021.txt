amid the rapidly changing financial market environment. In line with the strategies, 
we’ve set the key strategic goals for 2022 as ‘R.E.N.E.W. 2022’, mobilizing the 
Groupwide resources to attain them.Esteemed Shareholders, Investors, and Customers,Firstly, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for your unwavering support and encouragement for 
KB Financial Group’s innovation and growth.Even amid the challenging business environment due to the prolonged pandemic, we have mobilized 
Groupwide resources towards a brighter future driven by world-class talent and tireless innovation under 
the Group mission, ‘Financial services delivering change.’The Group continued solidifying its market presence as Korea’s leading financial group by strengthening 
the core competencies of its subsidiaries. In particular, the integration of Prudential Life and the robust 
performance of securities operations expanded the contribution of non-bank subsidiaries to more than 
40 percent of the Group’s overall net profit. On the global front, aggressive global expansions resulted in 
the M&As of Prasac Microfinance Institution in Cambodia and PT Bank KB Bukopin in Indonesia, securing 
future revenue sources through a balanced business portfolio as a leading financial group.Domestically, we made meaningful progress in 2021 towards our mid-term strategic goal of becoming 
‘your trusted financial partner for life’ as the top financial platform company. In October, we polished 
up KB Star Banking app, the Group’s flagship platform, drastically improving the simplicity, speed, and 
security of the customer experience. Customer convenience has been bolstered as the single platform 
integrates the key financial services of six distinct KB Financial Group subsidiaries, including: Easy Stock 
Trading Service of KB Securities; Digital payment service of KB Kookmin Card; and the Smart Insurance 
Claim service of KB Insurance.We are also broadening customer touchpoints for our non-financial platforms through such services as 
KB Real Estate, KB Cha Cha Cha, and Liiv M. In October, KB Insurance became the first Korean insurer to 
establish a healthcare subsidiary.Moreover, five of our subsidiaries—KB Kookmin Bank, KB Securities, KB Insurance, KB Kookmin Card, 
and KB Capital—have all obtained licenses for the MyData Service, so as to take the lead in the MyData 
market, which will become fully operational in 2022. Each subsidiary will provide personalized products 
and services relative to their respective specialties.004INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONIn the meantime, we raised the bar higher with our leadership in ESG 
management practices for sustainable growth. In June, KB Financial 
Group officially committed to carbon neutrality by 2050 under the 
strategy ‘KB Net Zero S.T.A.R.’ and became the first financial company 
in Asia and the first-ever Korean company to obtain approval from 
SBTi (Science-Based Target initiatives) for its carbon reduction goal. 
Moreover, KB Financial Group was the first Korean financial group to 
join the RE100 (Renewable Energy 100), a global corporate renewable 
energy initiative facilitating the collaboration of hundreds of large, 
ambitious businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity.Let me touch on the business financial results of the past year.KB Financial Group posted KRW 4.4 trillion in net profit for 2021, up 
KRW 941 billion from a year ago. Even after the preemptive provisioning 
for COVID-induced uncertainties, the Group’s net profit surge can 
be attributed to the growth in interest income led by an increase in 
corporate loans and improved net interest margin. Non-interest income 
also rose from wealth management, investment banking, credit cards, 
and insurance operations thanks to the enhanced fundamentals of the 
non-banking subsidiaries.The Group’s total assets grew by KRW 53.2 trillion year on year, reaching 
KRW 663.9 trillion as of the end of 2021. This considerable success was 
attainable through solid growth in corporate loans extended to prime 
SOHO and SMEs, expanded investments in securities as part of our 
profit diversification strategy, and global business expansion.These remarkable increases in earnings and assets stand out amid the 
adverse business environment mired in pandemic-induced uncertainty. 
Credit for this should go as much to the unwavering support of our 
customers and shareholders as it does to the tireless hard work of our 
dedicated employees. Going forward, we at KB Financial Group will 
do our utmost to continue developing through ceaseless growth and 
innovation.The pandemic has induced uncertainty both at home and abroad, and 
it poses yet another challenging year ahead for the financial sector. 
We are at the crossroads of a paradigm shift, where the ‘money move’ 
trend is observed from deposits to investments, while expediting the 
separation between the manufacturing and distribution of financial 
instruments.In meeting these transformative times, we at KB Financial Group 
remain focused on implementing our mid-to long-term strategies 
in 2022. We will channel the groupwide resources into achieving the 
R.E.N.E.W. 2022 key strategies.First, we will Reinforce the Core competitiveness to consolidate our 
profit base and achieve sound growth.To prepare for a fluctuating base rate trend, we will increase our 
income sources in corporate financing and capital markets and 
employ our professional asset management competencies to be a 
truly reliable financial partner both to our customers and the market.Expansion of Global & New Biz is our second goal to materialize 
business results in our global and non-financial business operations.On the global front, we will keep with the two-track strategy, where 
we will pursue retail banking business in the Southeast Asian markets 
while strategically pivoting to asset management and wholesale 
banking operations in advanced markets. To bolster the Group’s future 
growth drivers, we will fortify our market dominance in the four non-
financial platforms we selected for greater customer touchpoints. 
These include telecommunications, automobile services, and real 
estate, as well as digital healthcare services, in which we became the 
first to advance among all Korean financial institutions.Fourth, we will enhance ESG management practices to scale to new 
heights in our ESG Leadership.While seeking out new business opportunities in Net Zero facility 
investments, we will advance our practices for carbon neutrality. We 
will favorably finance businesses with proven success in their carbon 
reductions while expanding investments in the green sector. In 
fulfilling our social responsibility, we will adopt projects from a ‘win-
win’ perspective for SME companies with little or no experience or 
knowledge in ESG management.Lastly,  World-Class  Talents  &  Culture  is  our  ultimate  goal  for 
cultivating an open and creative organizational culture that will foster 
a higher caliber of talent.In recruiting and reassigning employees to ensure the digital and core 
growth sectors are adequately staffed, we will promote ‘KB-style agile 
organization’—an agile and well-organized corporate culture—at the 
Groupwide level.Looking ahead, 2022 will mark a milestone year for KB in our efforts 
to gain greater trust and support from our customers. To this end, 
we will continue with our unique customer-centric management 
practices that place the customer’s perspective at the core of our 
business strategies and make their values a paramount priority.Our third goal is to become No. 1 Customer-Centric  Platform, most 
trusted by customers through the enhanced KB Star Banking app and 
MyData Service.In  closing,  I  would  like  to  ask  for  your  continued  support  and 
encouragement this year. I wish our customers, shareholders, and 
their families abundant health and prosperity.The Group’s flagship application, KB Star Banking, will serve as the 
sole platform to access our financial services, including securities, 
insurance, credit cards, and banking services. We will establish a truly 
customer-centric platform by upgrading the user experience through 
a constant feedback flow of customer pain points.Thank you.We will also secure an edge with the MyData business by offering 
hyper-personalized services based on our refined data analysis results. 
Our focus will be to refine the customer experience by seamlessly 
connecting advanced customer services and optimal products via our 
integrated channels using innovative technologies.Yoon Jong-kyoo

society and leave economic turmoil in its wake. For a swift and systemic response to the 
challenges, KB Financial Group has established a Group-level Emergency Management 
Committee, which provides immediate support to companies, SMEs, and the 
underprivileged adversely affected by this unprecedented calamity. As such, KB Financial 
Group is translating its vision into reality as its financial services delivering change support 
its customers through the COVID-19 crisis for a happier life and a better world.Contributing to a Better WorldFinancing a Better WorldSupport for the Underprivileged
KB Financial Group’s COVID-19 relief programs are 
directed towards the underprivileged in our society. 
We donated masks and other PPE (personal protective 
equipment  for  COVID-19)  packages  to  1,900 
community childcare centers and 300 elderly homes 
nationwide and provided free delivery on prescriptions 
to 12,000 low-income families. We improved the 
living conditions of 375 underprivileged families and 
sponsored their heating bills to help them stay safe 
and warm over the cold winter months. We offered 
discounts on mobile phone bills to customers from 
the regions hit hard by the pandemic and for students 
of all grade levels, who had to go online at school 
under the physical distancing policy. We also donated 
COVID-19 preventive kits to several Southeast Asian 
countries, including Indonesia, Laos, and Cambodia, 
who struggled from the lingering spread of COVID-19.
 
Support for Small Business Owners
KB Financial Group focused its social contribution 
activities on small businesses ailing from COVID-19. 
The “Goodwill Consumers Campaign” encouraged 
cardholders  to  make  pre-payments  and  pre-
purchases to help local small companies mitigate the 
liquidity crunch. The Group also subsidized employees 
with KRW 11 billion Onnuri gift certificates for use 
at traditional markets. For the Korean Thanksgiving 
holiday,  known  as  Chuseok,  KB  Kookmin  Bank 
purchased KRW 600 million worth of rice and meat 
from local shops and traditional markets all across the 
nation and donated this food to 10,000 financially-
distressed people enduring hard times. Participating in 
the “Compassionate Landlord Campaign,” the Group 
reduced the rent for small business tenants from the 
buildings in its holding. We initiated a relay campaign 
to help floriculturists whose sales plummeted due to 
the COVID-19 physical distancing policy.Increased Issuance of ESG Bonds
KB Financial Group expanded its issuance of ESG 
bonds  to  finance  the  underprivileged  and  SME 
and microenterprises ailing under the pandemic. 
In addition, KB Kookmin Bank issued social bonds 
totaling KRW 400 billion and USD 1 billion worth of 
sustainability bonds to finance companies affected by 
COVID-19. In particular, the Bank was the first in the 
industry to issue foreign currency-denominated bonds 
to finance COVID-19 relief programs for companies. 
KB Kookmin Card issued social bonds totaling KRW 
1.3 trillion on eight separate occasions for the early 
settlement of credit sales for small business merchants 
suffering liquidity shortages due to the pandemic. 
 
Financial Support for Companies Damaged by 
COVID-19
KB Kookmin Bank provided new loans, extended 
the maturity of existing loans, and deferred the loan 
principal and interest payments for corporates clients 
who experienced direct/indirect pandemic-induced 
hardships. As of the end of 2021, we held a total

was extended for KRW 4.2 trillion existing loans. The 
loan balance of deferred principal reimbursements 
for installments amounted to KRW 380 billion, and 
the  loan  balance  for  deferred  principal/interest 
repayments stood at KRW 480 billion. KB Kookmin 
Bank  also  extended  the  reimbursement  period

financial experts boldly navigate and lead the financial paradigm 
so as to become the top-tier financial group that customers turn 
to first as a financial partner for life.2021 Key Activities and AchievementsReinforce the Core  
KB Financial Group recorded a historic-high net profit of KRW 4.4 trillion 
in 2021 thanks to continued revenue growth and sound risk management 
in the face of the protracted COVID-19 pandemic challenges. Each 
subsidiary did their part in dedicating great efforts to reinforcing their 
business competitiveness. Meanwhile, we also focused on strengthening 
the core competitiveness of our business lines, such as WM, CIB, and the 
capital markets at the Group level. As a result, the contributions from 
non-banking subsidiaries to the Group’s overall income jumped to 43% 
at the end of 2021, demonstrating the Group’s ability of generating 
profits from a balanced group portfolio.
 
Expansion of Global & New Biz  
Since the cross-border mergers and acquisitions of Prasac and Bukopin 
Bank, KB Financial Group has channeled its resources to more cohesively 
incorporate  their  global  assets  and  network  into  its  operations. 
Domestically, we are seeking out new opportunities beyond the financial 
landscape. In October, KB Insurance became the first Korean insurer to 
establish a digital healthcare subsidiary, KB Healthcare, and KB Kookmin 
Bank launched an upgraded Liiv Real Estate service. Meanwhile, the 
Group is also exploring innovative financial service areas through equity 
investments and business alliances with the Korea Digital Asset (KODA) 
and FINT, an AI-based wrap account service.
 
No.1 Platform (Customer-Centric)  
With the aim of becoming the No. 1 financial platform operator, KB 
Financial Group is actively embracing a customer-oriented digital 
transformation to enhance platform competitiveness as a comprehensive 
financial service provider. In October 2021, we reinforced our platform 
competitiveness with the launching of our remarkable app service, New 
KB Star Banking. This app seamlessly connects the primary services of all 
our subsidiaries, as well as the banks. We also introduced Liiv Next, a 
financial platform targetting the Z-generation as future potential 
customers. Furthermore, five of our subsidiaries—Kookmin Bank, KBSecurities, KB Insurance, KB Kookmin Card, and KB Capital—have 
obtained the MyData Service license, making it possible to provide data-
based hyper-personalized financial services.
 
ESG Leadership   
KB Financial Group is systematically implementing the Groupwide ESG 
strategies in tandem with the KB Green Wave 2030, the Group’s mid-to 
long-term ESG management roadmap. The Group declared its carbon 
neutrality goal, termed ‘KB Net Zero S.T.A.R., to be achieved by 2050. We 
were also the first Korean financial company to join the RE100 (Renewable 
Energy 100) initiative in 2021. These endeavors earned us both rewards 
and recognition for our ESG leadership at home and abroad: we scored 
an A+ rating on all the criteria for the second consecutive year in the ESG 
evaluation by the Korea Corporate Governance Service (KCGS); and we 
ranked first in the global sector of the banking industry in the 2021 Dow 
Jones  Sustainability  Index  World,  where  we  were  listed  for  a  sixth 
consecutive year.
 
World Class Talents & Culture  
KB Financial Group is committed to building an open and creative 
corporate culture that cultivates high-caliber talent. Through ‘reskill and 
upskill’ strategies, we continue to train and reassign our workforce to 
staff up the digital and core growth areas. Furthermore, Kookmin Bank 
became the first in the Group to introduce the DevOps (a set of practices 
that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops)) 
platform structure while expanding shared service centers (SSC) to future 
contact centers and KB One Cloud to promote an agile and open 
corporate culture.021INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONVision & Strategy

it poses yet another challenging year ahead for the financial sector. We 
are  at  the  crossroads  of  a  paradigm  shift,  where  the  ‘money  move’ 
trend is observed from deposits to investments, while expediting the 
separation  between  the  manufacturing  and  distribution  of  financial 
instruments.In meeting these transformative times, we at KB Financial Group remain 
focused on implementing our mid-to long-term strategies in 2022. We 
will  channel  the  groupwide  resources  into  achieving  the  R.E.N.E.W. 
2022 key strategies.First,  we  will  Reinforce  the  Core  competitiveness  to  consolidate  our 
profit base and achieve sound growth.
To prepare for a fluctuating base rate trend, we will increase our income 
sources in corporate financing and capital markets and employ our 
professional asset management competencies to be a truly reliable 
financial partner both to our customers and the market.Expansion of Global & New Biz is our second goal to materialize business 
results in our global and non-financial business operations.
On the global front, we will keep with the two-track strategy, where we 
will pursue retail banking business in the Southeast Asian markets while 
strategically  pivoting  to  asset  management  and  wholesale  banking 
operations in advanced nations. To bolster the Group’s future growth 
drivers, we will fortify our market dominance in the four non-financial 
platforms we selected for greater customer touchpoints. These include 
telecommunications, automobile services, and real estate, as well as 
digital healthcare services, in which we became the first to advance 
among all Korean financial institutions.Our third goal is to become the No. 1 Customer-Centric Platform most 
trusted by customers through an enhanced KB Star Banking app and 
MyData Service.
The Group’s flagship application, KB Star Banking, will serve as the sole 
platform to access our financial services, including securities, insurance, 
credit cards, and banking services. We will establish a truly customer-
centric platform by upgrading the user experience through a constant 
feedback flow of customer pain points.
We  will  also  secure  an  edge  with  the  MyData  business  by  offering 
hyper-personalized services based on our refined data analysis results. 
Our  focus  will  be  to  refine  the  customer  experience  by  seamlessly 
connecting advanced customer services and optimal products via our 
integrated channels using innovative technologies.Fourth, we will enhance ESG management practices to scale to new 
heights in our ESG Leadership.
While seeking out new business opportunities in Net Zero facility 
investments, we will advance our practices for carbon neutrality. We will 
favorably finance businesses with proven success in their carbon 
reductions while expanding investments in the green sector. In fulfilling 
our social responsibility, we will adopt projects from a ‘win-win’ 
perspective for SME companies with little or no experience or knowledge 
in ESG management.Lastly, World-Class Talents & Culture is our ultimate goal for cultivating 
an open and creative organizational culture that will foster a higher 
caliber of talent.
In recruiting and reassigning employees to ensure the digital and core 
growth sectors are adequately staffed, we will promote ‘KB-style agile 
organization’—an agile and well-organized corporate culture—at the 
Groupwide level.021INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONCORE COMPETENCY023ESG Leadership032Global Business030Digital Transformation034Risk ManagementINTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONESG LeadershipKB Financial Group, guided by its mission ‘financial services delivering change’, is committed to ESG

goal to ‘create sustainable value and enhance customer trust by promoting responsible management for 
the environment and society while disseminating healthy corporate governance’, KB Financial Group has 
set a three-pronged ESG strategy. First, we will advance our climate change strategy to help protect the 
environment; second, we will internalize responsible management for the good of society; and third, we 
will broaden the overall culture of transparent governance. These directions set the course of our focus 
areas in selecting and implementing ESG strategic tasks.In 2021, we established KB Net Zero S.T.A.R., our medium- and long-term carbon neutrality promotion 
strategy to address climate change. It will guide our commitment to support eco-friendly companies 
speed up their transformation into the low-carbon economy and align our strategies with the Paris 
Agreement to restore the environment. To that end, our goal is to achieve carbon neutrality in 
operational emissions by 2040 and for our Group’s financed emissions by 2050. The KB GREEN WAVE 
2030, our mid- to long-term ESG roadmap, expresses our intentions to expand the balance of ESG 
products, investments, and loans to KRW 50 trillion by 2030. This is just one of the ways we are making a 
positive impact on society through sustainable finance, and how we do our part in adding environmental 
and social value while securing green leadership in the green financial ecosystem.Sustainability ReportESG Governance
Advancing ESG Governance System and Implementation
In March 2020, KB Financial Group became the first Korean financial group to establish an ESG Committee within 
its Board of Directors. Comprised of all directors—both executive and non-executive, as well as non-standing 
directors, the committee performs a significant role in Groupwide ESG management practices. As the Group’s 
highest decision-making body concerning ESG management practices, the committee oversees the establishment 
of ESG strategies and policies and in monitoring/controlling that they are implemented. In 2021, the committee 
resolved the Group’s carbon neutrality strategies and the agenda for establishing the environmental & social risk 
management  standards  at  the  Group  level.  Each  subsidiary  also  operates  their  own  level-appropriate  ESG 
committee and consultation body, in which, they set their respective ESG strategic directions, expand green 
finance products and investments, and establish a risk management system for addressing climate change.Create sustainable value and enhance customer trustby promoting responsible management for environment and society anddisseminating healthy corporate governanceCarbon NeutralityInternal emissions by 2040

Environmental Conservation
KB Financial Group is well aware of the urgency in 
addressing climate change. In an effort to help offset the 
effects of pollution, we have established and phased in the 
Groupwide mid- to long-term carbon neutrality initiative KB 
Net Zero S.T.A.R. For the systematic management of climate 
change risks, we also upgraded our climate change risk 
management process with the Groupwide environmental 
and social risk management system. Moreover, we are 
securing our green leadership through global initiatives in 
various environmental sectors.CO2KB Net Zero S.T.A.R: a Mid-to Long-Term Carbon Neutrality 
Strategy 
In  June  2021,  KB  Financial  Group  established  KB  Net  Zero  S.T.A.R.,  a 
Group-level mid- to long-term carbon neutrality initiative to lend our 
financial acumen to transition into a low-carbon economy. The purpose 
of KB Net Zero S.T.A.R. is to foster and support eco-friendly businesses to 
accelerate the transformation into a low-carbon economy and restore 
the environment by aligning with the Paris Agreement. We’ve measured 
the  Groupwide  carbon  emissions  by  applying  the  methodologies 
recommended  by  the  global  initiatives,  SBTi  (Science-Based  Targets 
initiative) and PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials), to 
calculate and disclose our financed emissions from our investments in 
and loans to companies.Based on the outcomes, we have developed our mid- to long-term goals 
of achieving carbon neutrality in operational emissions by 2040 and our 
financed emissions by 2050. According to this strategy, we set a goal to 
cut our financed emissions by 33% by 2030 and by 61% by 2040; and 
operational emissions to be reduced by 42% by 2030. These carbon 
neutrality goals have been approved by the SBTi in October 2021, for the 
first time in Korea and among any financial company in Asia. This is a 
significant accomplishment, as our reduction goals are globally recognized 
for their objectivity through rigorous scientific verification.A Risk Management Base to Combat Climate Change  
KB Financial Group is keenly aware of the pivotal role the financial industry 
plays in fighting climate change. To this end, it has developed an environmental 
and social risk management policy (ESRM Policy) for a Groupwide integrated 
and systematic approach to managing the direct/indirect risks associated 
with environmental/social impacts. Our ESRM Policy classifies social and 
environmental risks into three areas: Exclusion, Attention, and Support. 
Social  and/or  environmental  impacts  that  are  considered  high  risk  are 
designated as Exclusion; significant risks to climate change are categorized 
as Attention for Climate Change; and those that positively impact the 
mitigation of climate change and support new green growth industries are 
classified as Support for Green Industries area. While we preemptively sift 
out the risk factors in the Exclusion and Attention areas, we actively finance 
the projects that fall within the Support area.Committed to a preemptive response to environmental crises, including 
climate change and natural disasters, KB Financial Group became the first 
Korean financial group to declare coal-free finance in September 2020. 
We took it upon ourselves to suspend any new project financing or the 
underwriting of bonds for the construction of coal-fired power plants, 
both domestically and abroad. In February 2021, KB Kookmin Bank joinedthe Equator Principles, which prohibits the financing of any large-scale 
development project that poses a risk to the environment. The Bank has 
completed an in-house process to align its business activities with the 
Equator Principles. Before investing in large-scale development projects, 
it  weighs  any  potential  social  and/or  environmental  risks  and  impacts. 
Relevant departments of the Bank appoint a staff who they provide with 
regular training on managing social and environmental risks to oversee 
the Equator Principles. The Bank transparently discloses its annual 
performance results through the annual publication of the Equatorial 
Principles Implementation Report.ESRM PolicyReport on Equator Principles Implementation 2020Member of ‘RE100’, a Global Initiative for the Renewable

In September 2021, KB Financial Group became the first Korean financial 
group  to  join  the  global  initiative  for  the  renewable  energy  transition, 
‘RE100’, which brings together the world’s most influential businesses 
committed to 100% renewable electricity. As a new and committed 
member, the Group plans to replace its electric power source with all 
renewable  energy  sources  by  2040.  To  this  end,  a  renewable  power 
generation facility will be constructed at the Group’s headquarters. Several 
options will be considered, including the power purchase agreement (PPA) 
on the purchase of electricity from renewable energy suppliers, the 
purchase of the renewable energy certificate (REC) and active investments 
in renewable energy projects.Green Buildings and a Green Corporate Culture

The  Financial  Stability  Board  (FSB)  created  the  Task  Force  on  Climate 
Change related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to meet the global call for 
standardized guidelines on financial information disclosure s concerningclimate change. In 2017, the TCFD released recommendations for the Task 
Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD Recommendations) 
for the consistent and voluntary disclosure of such information. Committed 
to a preemptive response to the climate change crisis, KB Financial Group 
became  a  member  of  the  TCFD  initiative  in  2018.  Since  then,  we  have 
faithfully implemented the Recommendations and disclosed the results in 
our annual Sustainability Report. In December 2021, we published the first 
TCFD Report detailing our achievements in addressing climate change in 
the four key areas of governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics

Since  signing  an  agreement  with  the  Ministry  of  Education  in  2018, 
allocating a total of KRW 75 billion funds over a period of five years, we 
have  funded  afterschool  programs  at  elementary  schools  nationwide, 
aided in the construction & expansion of public kindergartens, and added 
new preschools in regions that lack quality childcare programs. As of the

we increase the corporate value of the companies we invest 
in and introduce the products of and expand investments in

KB Financial Group actively works to enhance its corporate value for

of various stakeholder groups. Our ongoing efforts towards transparent 
and stable governance include the overhaul of the appointment and 
succession process of the CEO, reinforced internal controls, an industry-
first adoption of the Stewardship Code, and the independent operation 
of the BoD. The principles of the corporate governance of the Group 
entail the following: 1) to ensure a stable corporate governance through 
the formation of a BoD able to provide the Group with checks and 
balances; 2) to maintain transparent and objective governance through 
the disclosure of its standards, procedures, and outcomes of its business 
issues; 3) to ensure the composition of the BoD contains experts in 
various sectors to effectively address management issues and challenges 
facing the Group 4) to preserve the independence in the governance to 
shore up the BoD’s function of checking and balancing the power of 
the management. As a result of the close adherence to these principles, 
our  governance  practices  have  received  positive  ratings  from  both

consecutive year. 
 
(Stewardship Code) Advancing Stewardship Code Practices
KB Financial Group is the first Korean financial group that has adopted 
the Stewardship Code, which is currently being implemented at six of 
our significant subsidiaries: KB Kookmin Bank, KB Securities, KB Insurance, 
KB Asset Management, KB Life Insurance, and KB Investment. In 2021, 
we expanded the scope of governance-oriented stewardship liability. 
We  enhanced  the  ESG  assessment  and  our  monitoring  of  the  ESG 
performance status of the investee companies by establishing the 
standards for the exercise of proxy voting rights concerning environmental 
and social issues.KB Financial Group reports its stewardship code performance status to the 
Board of Directors on an annual basis. Each subsidiary’s website specifies 
the Stewardship Code and its policy/guidelines on the exercise of proxy 
voting rights and transparently discloses the exercise of voting rights. In 
2021, the Group exercised 1,003 proxy voting rights on 158 companies in 
Korea  and  sent  public  letters  to  and/or  made  confidential  questions  to 
investee companies in fulfillment of fiduciary duties as a steward managing 
the assets entrusted by our customers.2022 PlansKB Financial Group will further stabilize its governance structure and lay 
the foundation for mid- and long-term management to protect stakeholder 
interest in sustainable growth, enhanced corporate value, and shareholder 
value. In 2022, we will continue making reasonable and transparent decisions 
to further enhance corporate and shareholder value.Corporate Governance at KB Financial GroupThe Board of Directors (BoD) of KB Financial Group is the top decision-
making body deliberating and deciding on major business management 
issues of the Group and its subsidiaries. As of the end of March, 2022, non-
executive directors make up the majority of the BoD (7 non-executive,  
1 executive, and 1 non-standing), which helps ensure the management 
remains in check.Board of DirectorsKB Financial Group’s BoD assists non-executive directors in holding the 
management accountable by utilizing various systems that advance the 
independence  of  the  governance.  All  the  subcommittees,  except  the 
Subsidiaries’ CEO Director Nominating Committee and the ESG Committee, 
are  made  up  entirely  of  non-executive  directors,  which  protects  the 
independence of subcommittee operations and keeps the management 
in check. Non-executive directors’ rights and duties are stipulated in the 
BoD Regulations to protect their independence from the management. 
The BoD is supported by the Office of Board of Directors, which attends 
to its affairs autonomously.KB  Financial  Group  transparently  publicizes  the  standards,  procedures, 
and progress of all its business on its website to ensure transparency in its 
corporate governance. BoD and subcommittee activities, along with 
other governance issues are published annually in the Annual Report on 
Governance & Compensation.Principles of Director Appointment
Consisting solely of non-executive directors, the CEO Nominating 
Committee creates a shortlist of candidates through impartial and stringent 
qualification checks. It then nominates the selected candidates to the 
General Shareholders’ Meeting, which appoints the Chairman and CEO of 
KB Financial Group as stipulated in the Articles of Incorporation.The BoD of KB Financial Group has defined the core principles of appointing 
non-executive directors as ‘shareholder representativeness, expertise, and 
diversity.’ The pool of non-executive director candidates is managed year-028INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONround in terms of finance, business management, accounting, finance & 
risk management, laws & regulations, digital & IT and ESG & consumer 
protection. The non-executive director candidate nominating process 
involves three steps—pooling, evaluating, and nominating. Each step is 
carried out by different entities—the pooling by shareholders & external 
search firms, the evaluations by external advisory panels and nominating 
by the committee.We  manage  a  long  list  of  non-executive  director  candidates,  which  is 
regularly checked and scrutinized on a semi-annual basis through 
recommendations  from  shareholders  and  external  search  firms.  In 
particular, any shareholder possessing one or more shares in the Group 
can recommend candidates, and KB Financial Group is the first in the 
industry  to  adopt  such  a  practice.  To  ensure  objectivity  in  candidate 
evaluations, we hire advisory panels from outside the Group. The Non-
executive Director Nominating Committee finalizes the shortlist based on 
the results and following reference checks.The committee then reviews the qualifications of the shortlisted candidates 
as per the criteria set by relevant regulations and the Articles of Incorporation 
before nominating them to the GSM. In compliance with the Articles of 
Incorporation, the Chairman of the BoD is appointed from among non-
executive directors: the chairman presides over BoD meetings and ensures 
that it operates in accordance with the principles of checks and balances.Subcommittees of the Board
BoD  committees  are  delegated  with  specific  functions  of  the  BoD  as 
stipulated in the laws and the Articles of Incorporation, consisting of member 
directors with various background expertise in their respective fields. Under 
the BoD are several permanent committees and one special committee: the 
permanent committees include Audit Committee, Risk Management 
Committee, Evaluation & Compensation Committee, Non-Executive Director 
Nominating Committee, CEO Nominating Committee, Subsidiaries’ CEO 
Director Nominating Committee and the ESG Committee; and the special 
committee is the Audit Committee Member Nominating Committee.Assessment of the Board of Directors
Every year, the KB Financial Group BoD assesses the performance results 
of  the  Board  and  non-executive  directors  to  ensure  their  roles  and 
responsibilities have been properly fulfilled. The assessment reviews the 
following four areas: BoD Composition & Efficiency, Functions & Roles, 
Responsibilities, and Shareholders’ Right Protection & Shareholder Relations. 
The results are then reported at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders 
as feedback for improvements in the Board’s future operations. Executives 
and peer board members review the yearly performance of non-executive 
directors  against  the  criteria  of  Faithfulness,  Expertise,  Leadership,  and 
Contribution. They also take account of each non-executive directors’ 
yearly activities and attendance rate at the various meetings of the BoDand subcommittees. The results of the non-executive director assessment 
are then published in the annual corporate governance report, which also 
functions as a reference for reappointment by the Non-executive Director 
Nominating Committee.2021 Major Achievements 
In 2021, KB Financial Group held 13 BoD meetings, with an average 
attendance rate of 99.1%. The regular quarterly meeting received reports 
on quarterly business results and checked the progress in implementing 
management plans. It also received reports and discussed important issues, 
along  with  those  issues  mandated  for  report  to  the  Board  by  relevant 
regulations. In particular, the BoD decided to issue hybrid bonds to improve 
the  capital  adequacy  and  financial  structure  of  the  Group.  Under  the 
revised Act on the Structural Improvement of the Financial Industry, KB 
Financial Group (both the holding company and the Bank) was selected as 
“[one of the] systematically important financial institutions.” Accordingly, 
the Board came to a resolution on the KB Financial Group Contingency 
Plans, preparing expedient responses in the event of a management 
emergency. In a bid for bettering its shareholder returns, the Board also 
passed the 2021 Quarterly Dividend Plan, paying the first interim dividends 
since the launch of the Group. Based on the review results of the 2021 
performance results and business environment analysis, the Board 
deliberated and resolved the 2022 management plans.Governance StructureCommittees of the Board of DirectorsGeneral Meeting ofShareholdersBoard of DirectorsChief ExecutiveOfficerAudit CommitteeGeneral management of audit worksRisk Management CommitteeBuilding and determining policies and systems

Korea amidst the pandemic, while the MZ generations have risen 
up as a new powerful financial consumer group. Such trends have 
fueled the rapid proliferation of contact-free financial 
transactions, further blurring the boundaries between financial 
and non-financial services. Ultimately, such developments serve 
to intensify platform competition among fintech and big tech 
players. KB Financial Group is working to develop a top-tier 
digital platform, with its super app, KB Star Banking, playing an 
instrumental role. We aim to become the No. 1 financial platform

our differentiated expertise in wealth management.KB Star Banking MAU6.56.15.6(million)8.88.07.1201620172018201920202021Reinforcing the Competitiveness of Core Financial Platforms 
In November 2021, KB Financial Group launched the New KB Star Banking 
app. This super app serves as a Groupwide hub platform connecting the 
key functions of the Group’s subsidiaries, including its securities, insurance, 
credit cards, and the bank. The app received positive market feedback for 
its upgraded platform competitiveness, serving to reinforce its reputation 
as a comprehensive financial group. In order to buoy customer engagement 
and the resultant 3T (traffic, time-sharing, transaction) performance, the 
app added on the core functions of the KB subsidiaries and renewed the 
mobile-friendly UI/UX, enhancing its convenience and service capability. 
The total digital payment app, KB Pay, has forged a leading financial 
platform that integrates banking services with wealth management and 
payment services. For the purpose of expanding our customer base, new 
customized platforms targeting key demographics were added. M-able 
mini is a simple mobile trading system (MTS) platform for the MZ generation 
and for those interested in stock-trading and wealth management, while 
Liiv Next is a specialized platform aimed at the interests of generation Z. In 
a bid to lead the platform service in the corporate financing sector, we 
upgraded the Star CMS (cash management service) and forex internet 
banking service while revamping our corporate banking (internet/mobile) 
services to produce a comprehensive corporate financial service in anticipation 
of the competitive market for corporate digital financial services.Meanwhile,  we  bolstered  the  monitoring  and  quality  assurance  on  the 
Group platforms to systemize the analysis of digital platforms and gain an 
objective insight into advancing our platform competitiveness. In addition 
to our suggestions to improve the usability of our major platforms, we 
consulted external digital research agencies and a customer panel 
(comprised solely of individuals from the MZ generations (KB D.N.A.)) to 
gather ideas for reinforcing the UI/UX and competitiveness of our platforms.Reaching Far into Every Aspect of Our Customers’ Daily Lives
By converging lifestyle services with financial services, our platforms set 
themselves apart from our competitors and big tech firms. The upgraded 
UI and UX of the KB Real Estate have been vastly improved in terms of 
infrastructure and content. Boasting the nation’s most extended list of 
used cars available for sale, KB Cha Cha Cha integrates auto financing with 
a platform service that relates to automotive interests. In October 2021, KB 
Insurance established a healthcare subsidiary, which launched the 
healthcare platform, O-Care.KB Financial Group commands market dominance in the authentication 
service, a critical part of the financial business linking platforms to services. 
KB  Mobile  Certification,  launched  last  year  as  the  industry’s  first  self-
developed  private  authentication  service,  has  locked  in  9.6  millionsubscribers as of the end of 2021. More importantly, the certification is not 
only compatible with every service platform at our subsidiaries, it is also 
used for integrated authorization with MyData Services and governmental 
services like the Home Tax service of the National Tax Service and the 
Korean  government’s  virtual  assistant  service  “Public  Secretary.”  The 
secure and reliable performance of KB Mobile Certification enabled us to 
earn  licenses  in  a  digital  signature  certification  business  and  certified 
electronic document intermediary service in October 2021.KB Financial Group explores how it can creatively apply the varied big data 
of its customers, such as in offering personalized products and services and 
attracting new customers. KB Kookmin Bank, KB Kookmin Card, KB 
Securities, KB Insurance, and KB Capital have been designated as MyData 
Service  providers.  KB  Kookmin  Bank  and  KB  Kookmin  Card  piloted  the 
MyData Service as of December 1, 2021. In a bid to lead the fierce competition 
for the dominance of MyData Service, KB Financial Group subsidiaries will 
contribute their specialty products and services to the MyData Service and 
their key content to the Group’s flagship platform KB Star Banking app.Systematic and Segmented Marketing Approach Corresponding 
to the Customer Journey 
To attend to the rising significance of digital marketing and the growing 
demand for a systematic and professional marketing approach, KB Kookmin 
Bank established a Retail Marketing Group within its organization, increasing 
investments  and  adding  to  the  digital  marketing  workforce.  Meanwhile, 
we’ve reinforced our Groupwide digital marketing competitiveness through 
customer-oriented  marketing  tailored  to  the  different  stages  of  the 
customer journey, along with a Groupwide data-based marketing system, 
Group Data Management Platform (DMP).Fundamental Transformation into an Agile Organization
In order to create an agile corporate culture that quickly addresses customer 
needs and boldly embraces innovation, KB Financial Group restructured 
and  consolidated  the  Bank’s  business  and  technology  groups  into  a 
platform-based organization. We also adopted an Agile Coaching Program

finance market, KB Financial Group will focus its 2022 initiatives on providing 
customers with the most convenient and valuable benefits through 
platform innovation, content power enhancement, data application system 
upgrades, and DT change management.030INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONPlatform Innovation
The Group’s hub app, KB Star Banking, will expand its scope of service 
connection with subsidiaries and external services to become the key 
platform. It will also enhance individualized total wealth management 
services based on the MyData Service and process innovation for product 
subscription. In the corporate banking operation, we will reinforce custom-
made product/service lineups based on the integrated analysis of big data. 
While upgrading the KB Star Corporate Banking Service through strengthening 
the cash management service (CMS) function, we are developing an open 
API platform to connect with external platforms. We will utilize the magnetic 
security transmission (MST) technology of Samsung Pay to achieve the 
scalability of KB Pay. We also plan an Open Pay service that will enable the 
service to be compatible with the credit card services of other companies, 
while inducing customer use with our reinforced products/service lineups.Content Power Enhancement
We will provide differentiated wealth management services specialized in 
MyData-based finance to gain a competitive edge. Our MyData Services 
will specialize in the business models of each subsidiary (KB Kookmin Bank 
in total wealth management, KB Securities in investments, KB Insurance 
in health-related content, KB Kookmin Card in lifestyle services, and KB 
Capital in auto asset management). Also, in featuring the core content of 
our subsidiaries, the MyData Service will offer customers varied MyData 
Service experiences, in pursuit of more cross-selling opportunities. In 
addition, KB Wallet, which is digital wallet platform, will seamlessly provide 
comprehensive  customer-oriented  content,  including  electronic 
documents, coupons, and certificates. In terms of the certification, KB 
Mobile Certification will play a key role in our business expansion into the 
authentication  business.  We  will  apply  for  authorized  agencies  of 
identification to secure the public credibility of our certification. Based on 
our certified license for the service, we will implement the certified 
electronic  document  intermediary  service  and  make  the  certification 
system more scalable in tandem with the growing number of users.Advancing the Data Application System
We will discover the behavioral data specified by our subsidiaries’ MyData 
and their industries and refine the big data collected from external 
channels to upgrade the customer analysis and insightful results from the 
Group’s data management platform (DMP). Based on these outcomes, 
we will refine the segments of the customer journey analytics and 
reinforce our competitiveness of data-driven personalization marketing. 
To increase the efficiency of the Group’s data analysis, we will take advantage 
of the business intelligence and devise the roadmap for developing data 
analytic personnel to reinforce the Groupwide data analysis capabilities.Digital Transformation Change Management
We will strive to enhance digital quality control to minimize negative 
customer feedback and eradicate misselling practices. To this end, we are 
creating a digital quality control unit that oversees the quality assurance 
(QA) on the Groupwide platform, which will effectively address customer 
pain points and reinforce our service quality as a customer-centered 
platform. We also plan to complete a Groupwide KB Future ContactCenter by 2023. While seamlessly coordinating the customer centers of 
each subsidiary at the Groupwide level, the Center will tap into innovative 
technologies, including AI, to attend to the needs of customers 24/7 with 
the help of the Callbot and Chatbot functions as a life-care assistant 
service. Platform service will be further perfected through seamless 
customer-oriented services.KB Star Banking: KB Financial Group’s Super App 
KB  Financial  Group  revamped  its  KB  Star  Banking  App  to  become  the 
Groupwide super app. The new KB Star Banking app is a scalable total 
financial platform that serves as the Groupwide hub platform providing its 
customers with comprehensive financial services. KB Star Banking offers 
easy access to the 33 key services of six subsidiaries, including KB Securities’ 
‘Easy Stock Trading’ service, KB Kookmin Card’s ‘Digital payment service’ 
service, and KB Insurance’s ‘Smart Insurance Claims’ service. Moreover, 
featuring the MyData-based wealth management service, the app 
provides  personalized  wealth  management  services  based  on  its 
comprehensive analysis of the complete customer asset information, 
including their assets with other financial institutions and non-financial 
assets as well as individual bank deposits. Custom-tailored services 
have improved the utility for customers with their increased capabilitiesand convenience. Such services include personalized financial content, 
customized services according to customer preference, and adjustable/
personalized user interfaces.KB Star Banking continues to evolve through 2022. The app will continue 
to reinforce its function as the Groupwide hub platform by internalizing 
the subscription functions of subsidiaries, which will facilitate a seamless 
switch to the key services of subsidiaries within the app without having 
to close it out. It will expand the product/service lineups of its subsidiaries 
and will adequately equip the Group’s non-financial benefits, such as 
KB Real Estate, KB ChaChaCha, KB Healthcare, and Liiv M services to 
succeed. As it will also feature public service functions, KB Star Banking 
will be the only platform for an unrivaled user experience as it will serve

When  it  comes  to  emerging  markets,  KB  aims  to  transform  the  major 
target  markets  of  Indonesia,  Cambodia,  and  Vietnam,  into  the  second 
“Mother Market”. KB subsidiaries enter into such markets to provide local 
customers with KB’s range of comprehensive financial services, while 
expanding its market power with its digital services.Indonesia
KB Kookmin Bank successfully secured the management rights of the PT 
Bank KB Bukopin by appointing an executive member of its Indonesian 
bank. The Bank also laid the groundwork for sustainable growth through 
a capital increase in November 2021. As it has established a customer 
base for key Korean corporations active in the local market, the Bank has 
developed its sales organization and management system to build quality 
asset portfolios in the local SME and retail banking operations. In its 
aim to introduce its IT and digital expertise to PT Bank KB Bukopin, KB 
Kookmin  Bank  is  confident  it  will  become  a  leading  bank  in  the  local 
Indonesian market of digital banking.In May 2021, KB Securities signed a shareholders’ agreement with one of 
Indonesia’s top 10 securities companies. Under the agreement, KB Securities 
has acquired a 65% stake in Valbury Securities as from February 2022. The 
acquisition is strengthening our standing as a total financial group in 
Indonesia, creating synergy with the KB subsidiaries active in the local 
market. As KB Securities has already successfully fostered its Vietnamese 
subsidiary KBSV, the Company is well poised to transform Valbury into a 
leading Indonesian-based securities firm.In 2020, KB Capital established the local subsidiary SKBF (PT. Sunindo 
Kookmin Best Finance) in Indonesia. Since then, the Company is growing 
its market power in its main business area of auto financing. In 2021, it 
became the designated local financier for Hyundai Motor Company and 
Hyundai Construction Equipment. Leveraging its captive customer base 
of Hyundai affiliates, SKBF will seek additional opportunities to collaborate 
with peer subsidiaries within the market, such as PT Bank KB Bukopin 
and PT Kookmin Best Insurance Indonesia, to lead the local auto financing 
market.Cambodia
In October 2021, KB Kookmin Bank bought out the remaining 30% stake 
in Prasac Microfinance Institution. This completed KB Kookmin Bank’s full 
100%  stake  acquisition  of  the  largest  microfinance  deposit-taking 
institution (MDI) in Cambodia. Despite the disruptions the pandemic 
brought on, Prasac Microfinance has maintained steady growth throughits 182 sales networks throughout the nation. KB Kookmin Bank plans to 
turn its new subsidiary into a commercial bank in the very near future 
which is set to become a leading bank in Cambodia.Vietnam  
In December 2020, KB Securities launched the joint venture, KB FINA Joint 
Stock Company, in Vietnam, and began operating its total digital financial 
platform. In 2021, the Company launched a service enabling customers to 
open accounts with KB Securities Vietnam on the app without visiting a 
brick-and-mortar branch. The service gained 550,000 subscribers in its 
first year in service. In November 2021, it became the first non-financial 
institution in Vietnam to obtain a third-party distributor license, which 
entitles the Company to sell mutual funds. KB FINA will further expand its 
mass market customer base through user-friendly services and is expected 
to serve as a future digital facilitator among KB subsidiaries entering into 
the local market.Thailand   
In January 2021, KB Kookmin Card acquired a 49.99% stake in KB J Capital, 
a Thai credit finance company (a board seat requires at least 50.99% stake). 
This made the Company the first Korean credit card issuer to enter the 
Thai market since the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. KB J Capital makes full 
use  of  the  sales  channels  of  its  local  partners  and  is  sustaining  stable 
growth with the reduced funding costs thanks to the payment guarantee 
by KB Kookmin Card. KB Kookmin Card will take advantage of KB’s core 
financial capabilities to reinforce its product lineup and channel network 
to secure its customer base and diversify revenue sources.Advanced Markets 
In advanced markets, we will continue to promote the OTD (origination-
to-distribution) project. By increasing collaboration and strategic alliances 
with global leaders, we will develop diverse products targeting advanced 
markets and expand our distribution into the Korean market. In the global 
financial hubs, such as New York, London, Hong Kong, and Singapore, we 
will expand the growth of a wholesale network that will secure large local 
and multinational companies to reinforce our market position.Singapore   
In April 2021, KB Kookmin Bank obtained a preliminary license from the 
Monetary Authority of Singapore for a local branch office, which began 
operations  in  January  2022.  Aside  from  local-currency-based  retail 
banking, the Singapore branch is qualified to handle all business, from 
corporate  and  investment  banking  to  capital-market  activities  and 
brokerage transactions.032INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONEntering Asia’s largest financial hub market, along with its capital markets, 
KB  Financial  Group  has  completed  a  round-the-clock  capital  market 
infrastructure connecting London and New York. We will utilize the 
experience and capabilities we accumulated in the global IB and capital 
markets to develop the Singapore branch into a CIB and capital market 
base for the Asia-Pacific region.2022 PlansIn 2022, KB Financial Group is assuming a different approach with its 
subsidiaries, which will continue exploring M&A opportunities while seeking 
organic growth for their existing networks.In Indonesia, where we have the most local subsidiaries, the peer subsidiaries 
(KB Kookmin Bank, KB Securities, KB Insurance, KB Kookmin Card, and KB 
Capital) will closely collaborate while scaling up their respective business 
competencies. In particular, the PT Bank KB Bukopin will primarily focus on 
swiftly  normalizing  its  operations  and  reinforcing  its  stability.  It  will  also 
expand its retail and SME banking asset portfolios while bolstering its digital 
banking competency. As for Valbury Securities, which will be fully acquired 
in  2022,  it  will  completely  rebrand  itself  as  a  member  of  KB  Financial 
Group on the local market. In Cambodia, we will focus on the expedient 
transformation of Prasac Microfinance Institution a commercial bank. 
By transferring KB’s advanced competencies and corporate value, Prasac 
will increase its deposit-taking activities and loan product lineups, upgrade 
its credit rating models, and reinforce digital competencies to become a 
commercial bank.In the future, KB Financial Group will expand its sustainable growth engine 
by strengthening and expanding its global business operations.KB Global Expansion Milestones2017201920202021Vietnam

level to respond to both the rapidly-changing business environment, and the 
regulatory shifts and challenges in the financial markets. The Group-level risk 
management system focuses on increasing group risk transparency and 
preventing risk transfer among subsidiaries. Most importantly, its prime concern 
lies in facilitating a more efficient and comprehensive approach to management 
decision-making in line with the Group-level management goal and business 
strategies. We run biannual Groupwide stress testing to develop responsive 
measures by scenario and monitor potential risk factors on an ongoing basis. The 
outcomes are also instrumental in determining the Group-level risk appetite and 
for making management decisions.Group Risk GovernanceRisk Management CommitteeRisk Management CouncilRisk Management Department∙  Set risk appetite & internal capital limitsDevelop group-level risk policies∙   Consult on the matters delegated bythe Risk Management Committee and  
pending risk management issuesKB Kookmin BankKB SecuritiesKB InsuranceKB Kookmin CardPrudential Life InsuranceKB Asset ManagementKB CapitalKB Life InsuranceKB Real Estate TrustKB Savings BankKB InvestmentKB Data SystemsKB Credit InformationRisk GovernanceIn principle, all of KB Financial Group’s risk-related policies, regulations, 
management systems, and decision deliberations, align with the risk 
management philosophy of ‘pursuing stable and sustainable growth [through 
the balance] between risk, profit and capital in our management activities.’ 
To implement risk management strategies in compliance with the 
aforementioned principle, we established a Groupwide risk management 
system for integrated risk monitoring at the Group-level.The Risk Management Committee is a subcommittee under the Board of 
Directors,  which  delegates  risk  management-related  authorities  to  the 
Committee to set the Group-level risk management strategies, determine 
risk appetites, and supervise risk management policies and system 
appropriateness.The Risk Management Council consists of risk management officers from 
the holding company as well as from the subsidiaries, and is responsible for 
deliberating on matters delegated by the Risk Management Committee 
and consulting on detailed risk management issues.The risk management department of the holding company monitors and 
manages the status of the Groupwide risk operations and the limits of 
internal capital by developing risk management policies and operating 
relevant processes. The risk management departments at each subsidiaryprovide  around-the-clock  checks  on  risk  types  and/or  any  emerging 
developments and reports these findings to the Group Risk Management 
Committee  and  Board  of  Directors  through  the  subsidiary’s  Chief  Risk 
Officers (CRO) and the Group’s CRO.
 
Risk Management StrategiesOur risk management strategies focus on improving our enterprise-wide risk 
transparency,  preventing  risks  from  transferring  among  subsidiaries,  and 
efficiently  supporting  our  mid-to  long-term  strategies  and  management 
decision-making  through  preemptive  responses  to  the  rapidly  changing 
financial environment. Recognizing credit, the market, interest rates, liquidity, 
operational  issues,  credit  concentration,  strategy,  our  reputation,  and 
insurance risks as the key risk factors to keep watch on, we develop risk 
management  strategies  and  set  risk  appetites  by  type  to  measure  and 
manage them through the use of statistical techniques.Stress Testing 
KB  Financial  Group  runs  stress  testing  at  least  twice  a  year  to  reflect 
economic  cycles  and  forecasts  in  order  to  analyze  and  proactively 
respond to the impact of any unforeseen environmental disruptions to 
the Group. The test results by profit/loss, capital adequacy, and risk type 
in different scenarios are then reported to the management and the RiskManagement Committee to assist in the projection of their Groupwide 
risk tolerance and management decision-making for the future.Scenarios are set in three stages: Base, Medium, and Severe according to 
the severity of each scenario based on probable risk factors that could 
gravely impact on the Group portfolio from the risk factors recognized 
from  the  business  environmental  analysis.  We  apply  different  stress 
testing models to analyze different risk types.Basel III-based Approach for Group Credit Risk Management 
KB Financial Group has been calculating Group risk-weighted assets and 
capital adequacy ratios by the Basel III standards since December 2013 
following the introduction of the Basel III framework by the Korean Financial 
Services Commission (FSC). To further elevate the efficacy of risk 
management across all subsidiaries, we developed a single model-based 
Internal  Ratings  Based  Approach  (IRB)  in  2016,  which  was  thoroughly 
vetted by the Financial Supervisory Services (FSS), and have since been 
using it to calculate BIS ratios. KB Financial Group and KB Kookmin Bank, in 
particular,  have  both  gained  FSS  approval  on  their  methodology  for 
calculating risk-weighted assets, as permitted in ‘Basel Ⅲ: Finalizing post-
crisis reforms’, which were then reflected as of September 2020. We expect 
that the application of IRB in credit risk management will help advance risk 
management systems and ultimately enhance the soundness of management 
at the Group level.034INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION2021 Major Achievements
Advancing the Risk Management of Group Portfolio 
In  keeping  with  rising  household  debt  and  mounting  internal/external 
uncertainty—such  as  the  prolonged  COVID-19  pandemic,  KB  Financial 
Group  is  advancing  its  preemptive  risk  management  through  analyzing 
regulatory impacts and keeping a watch on group-level risk factors. We 
reinforced and refined our risk management of potential NPLs and subprime 
borrowers,  applying  different,  circumspect  monitoring  by  customer 
segment.  We  also  preemptively  managed  the  risks  stemming  from  the 
ongoing  pandemic  crises.  While  keeping  a  close  eye  on  our  corporate 
clients in the industries that were hit especially hard by the pandemic, we 
run periodic credit monitoring and prepared soft-landing plans for 
vulnerable borrowers and provisioning for potential insolvencies.Preemptively Countering New Risk Types 
KB  Financial  Group  sustains  preemptive  and  proactive  responses  to 
emerging risks. In step with the growth of alternative investments and 
global business operations as our new growth drivers, we are reviewing our 
alternative investment process and reinforcing our auditing competency 
for alternative investments. Our overseas subsidiaries also refined their risk 
management systems and increased periodic monitoring. To advance 
the  ESG-related  risk  management  system,  we  enacted  the  Groupwide 
environmental, social risk management (ESRM) Policy and developed the 
loan/investment risk management policy, which is based on the Groupwide 
portfolio.Enhance Capital Efficiency and Complex Risk Management 
KB Financial Group is establishing a market/operational risk measurement 
and management system to take a proactive approach in compliance with 
the updated Basel III. We enhanced portfolio monitoring and rebalancing 
that is based on the return on risk-weighted asset (RoRWA). These risk 
management activities helped us enhance efficiency in capital management. 
While establishing preemptive management systems in the event of an 
emergency, we reinforced our contingency readiness through the 
development of a Groupwide Recovery Plan in October 2021. It is a feasible 
and agile contingency plan that enables an immediate and effective 
response at the Group level in the event of a crisis. All in all, the integrated 
approach further reinforced the Groupwide risk management capabilities.2022 PlansWe can surely expect the slated base rate hikes and departure from 
COVID-19 financial relief programs in 2022 to disrupt the asset stability 
of financial institutions. In anticipation, KB Financial Group is concentratingon enhancing the Groupwide risk management competency and refining 
its risk management system. We will step up our monitoring efforts by 
borrower group and industry, apply meticulous credit checks on vulnerable 
borrowers, enhance our preemptive risk management capabilities concerningcapital markets, CIB, and global business operations, and establish our ESG 
risk management system. As such, we are solidifying the base of the 
sustainable growth for the Group through our ability to look ahead and 
be prepared in our responses to the changes in the world outside.Emerging Risk Management
At KB Financial Group, we classify emerging risks and separately manage them through preemptive countermeasures. Emerging risks can be 
defined as ones arising from developing disruptions within the economic, environmental, and/or social surroundings of the Group and which  
are deemed to pose significant impact on our operations in the long run. This year, “risks related to demographic shifts”, risks in the “paradigm 
[shift] following the digital finance innovation” and “environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues”, have been identified as emerging risks. 
Their definitions, impact on our business, and our countermeasure solutions can be found below.RisksBusiness ImpactsCountermeasuresRisks related to demographic shifts
Demographics are changing as the aging society 
is expected to cause decreases in average 
incomes per household. Also, due to the rising 
propensity to consume, financial debts show no 
significant growth. The shrinking household loan 
market could negatively impact the Group’s sales 
base and profitability.We can expect a reduced demand for loans  
due to the aging demographics of households, 
coupled with reduced corporate investment 
capacity from weakened real economic demands. 
The KB Economic Research Institute analysis 
predicted that the Group’s profitability will drop 
after 2025 due to a slow-down in household  
loan growth, falling long-term interest rates,  
and the narrowing spread between short- and 
long-term interest rates.To hedge against potential risks stemming from 
sluggish household loan growth and/or narrowing 
spreads, KB is departing from the deposit-loan 
margin-based revenue structure to diversify its 
revenue source into CIB and WM operations.  
In the meantime, KB is preparing itself for socio-
demographic risks by diversifying its offshore 
investment portfolio into emerging markets  
with fewer issues related to the demographics  
of an aging society.Paradigm shift following the digital 
finance innovation  
Rising risks of IT-related, information protection/
fraud associating innovative technology/finance 
and financial institutions’ risks of failing to keep 
pace with innovative technologies and finance 
and in proportion to the growth opportunities 
provided through innovation which gained 
momentum during the pandemicESG issues 
Inability to meet the non-financial factors 
affecting corporate value/sustainability such as 
- the regulatory and market demands associated 
with environmental, social, and governance 
managementDigital innovations in technologies/finance are 
appearing all across the traditional value chain  
of financial sector, giving rise to new business 
models, products, and services.KB performs in-depth analysis and review of 
potential risks in digital finance innovation to 
reinforce its preemptive risk management while 
taking full advantage of big data and machine 
learning techniques to enhance its risk 
management infrastructure and competencies.In tandem with growing ESG concerns among 
global institutional investors, ESG issues have 
become the decisive factors in investment 
decisions. Also, regulatory changes, such as  
the carbon emissions trade scheme, can affect 
asset value fluctuations in high-risk investments,  
which will work against the Group’s soundness 
and profitability.Establishing an ESG masterplan reflecting  
Groupwide ESG control, KB is developing 
countermeasures for ESG issues, such as 
establishing a dedicated team and augmenting 
their role, while creating an ESG risk-weighted 
loan/investment portfolio.035INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONManagement’s Discussion & AnalysisIn 2021, the global economy began to pick up on the back of governments’ 
economic stimulus packages and the worldwide vaccine rollout. The 
Korean economy also bounced back with a growth rate of 4% on the 
strength of its historic-high record in exports. While news of the scheduled 
rate hike poses a positive outlook for the banking sector, there are also 
concerns  about  asset  quality  issues  related  to  the  COVID-19  financial 
forbearance programs and household debts. On the other hand, it is 
predicted that the performance of the non-banking sector will struggle 
as the stock market will falter with fluctuating interest rates and central 
banks’ tapering. Even amid such mixed outlooks for so many, KB Financial 
Group reported robust performance results for 2021, solidifying its 
position as a leading financial group in Korea.In 2021, the Group’s net profit surged by 27.2% from the previous year to 
a record-high KRW 4,410 billion. The basic EPS also soared by 25.9% to 
reach KRW 11,134. Such remarkable performance is ascribable to the 
substantial growth of the Group’s core earnings: net interest income 
significantly rose, thanks to the solid growth in loans in won along with 
cross-border M&As, while net fee & commission income also significantly 
expanded as a result of our competency-building in WM and IB operations. 
ROE improved considerably to 10.22%, consolidating the Group’s 
fundamentals for earnings. ROE on a recurring basis remained within a 
stable 10% range each quarter. These improvements in the Group 
performance can be attributed to our consistent efforts to diversify the 
Group revenue sources and to build the competencies of the core 
businesses of our subsidiaries. In particular, the non-banking contribution 
to the Group’s net profit expanded to 42.6% this year.Group net interest income amounted to KRW 11,230 billion for 2021, up 
by a whopping KRW 1,508 billion from the previous year, driving the 
Group’s robust performance results.Group non-interest income rose by  17.5% year-on-year to KRW 3,254 
billion, led by the improved performance of non-bank businesses—
securities, insurance, and credit cards. As a result of this balanced 
growth of core earnings in both the banking and non-banking operations, 
the Group’s gross operating income rose by 15.9% to KRW 14,484 billion 
in 2021.In terms of expenses, Group G&A expenses grew by KRW 386 billion, or 
5.7%, from the previous year to KRW 7,201 billion, which is primarily due 
to the additional costs in consolidating Prudential Life, Prasac, and PT 
Bank KB Bukopin. Aside from the M&A effects, it was up only 0.8% from 
the previous year.The Group provision for credit losses stood at KRW 1,185 billion, up by 
KRW 142 billion from the previous year. Group credit costs edged up from 
the previous year to 0.30%.Key Financial IndicatorsROA

7.9KB Financial Group’s net profit for 2021 surged a whopping 27.2% from 
the previous year to reach KRW 4,410 billion, proving the Group’s earnings 
power. The remarkable results can be attributed to a substantial increase 
in core earnings, including net interest income and net fee & commission 
income, as well as the inorganic growth effect from M&As. As a result of 
the subsidiaries’ consistent endeavors to enhance core business 
competencies, there were universal improvement in the performance 
results of all bank, securities, insurance, and credit card. The non-bank 
subsidiaries’ contribution to the Group’s net profit also improved, accounting 
for 42.6%.Group Profitability Overview(bn won, %)Net Interest Income

27.21)   The consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been 
restated retrospectively to reflect the accounting policy changes in connection with the 
IFRIC decision regarding K-IFRS No. 1019037INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONThe  Group’s  net  interest  income  amounted  to  KRW  11,230  billion,  a 
significant year-on-year increase of 15.5%, or KRW 1,508 billion, driving 
the Group’s overall performance improvement. This is primarily due to 
solid loan growth, led by the 7.9% year-on-year growth in the bank’s 
loans in Won, which secured a stable profit base. Plus, the improved NIM 
boosted the Bank’s net interest income by 14.4% year on year, and the 
net interest income from Prudential Life and Prasac added about KRW 
500 billion to the Group’s net interest income.In  2021,  the  Group  NIM  and  Bank  NIM  stood  at  1.83%  and  1.58%, 
respectively, both improved by seven basis points from the previous year. 
This advancement in the NIM was made possible through the improvement 
of  net  interest  spreads  through  profit-oriented  portfolio  management 
while  increased  core  deposit  size  relieved  funding  costs.  In  prudent 
management of our NIM performance, we will fine-tune the loan pricing, 
adjust the funding costs policies to market developments, and upgrade 
our portfolio management of securities investments to enhance 
profitability. In 2022, NIM performance is expected to further improve as 
base rate hikes are forecast to fully take hold.Group net fee & commission income increased 22.5%, or KRW 667 billion, 
from the previous year to KRW 3,626 billion. This is mainly due to the 
increased credit card fees on the back of the restoring consumption and 
the Bank’s recovery in the sale of trust products, in proportion to the 
surge  in  brokerage  commission  income  driven  by  the  booming  stock 
market and our enhanced IB business competencies. Group net fee & 
commission income, which had hovered over KRW 2 trillion for years, 
jumped well above the KRW 3 trillion mark to the mid-range in 2021. This 
phenomenal  record  was  made  possible  through  competency-building 
and  non-bank  portfolio  diversification  efforts,  as  much  as  to  the 
unprecedented rallies in the stock market.In 2021, other operating profit decreased by KRW 183 billion from the 
previous year due to weak performances in securities, derivatives, and 
foreign exchange related businesses due to market rates and rising won-
dollar exchange rates. Still, other operating income in the insurance 
sector advanced by KRW 25.7 billion year-on-year as KB Insurance’s 
earnings  fundamental  gradually  recovered,  and  the  M&A  effect  was 
recognized from the acquisition of Prudential Life.Group G&A expenses grew by 5.7%, or KRW 386 billion, from the previous 
year to KRW 7,201 billion. This was due to the additional recognition of 
KRW 300 billion in G&A expenses from the year before following the 
acquisitions of Prudential Life, Prasac, and PT Bank KB Bukopin. Without 
these M&A factors, G&A expenses produced a mere 0.8% year-on-yeargrowth as tangible results from the Groupwide effort towards cost 
management and workforce efficiency.In 2021, the Cost Income Ratio (CIR) down by 4.9%p from a year earlier 
to 49.7%. Cost efficiency fully developed, driven by a substantial increase 
in core earnings and an improved workforce structure. In particular, the 
CIR reached an all-time low of 46.3%, excluding the one-off factors of 
ERP and digitalization costs. By enhancing our earnings power and 
managing the Groupwide expenses, we will maintain the CIR performance 
within the mid-40% range, stabilizing down from the historically stagnant 
mid-50% levels.The Group’s provision for credit losses was KRW 1,185 billion, a mild KRW 
142 billion increase year-on-year despite asset growth and the reduced 
reversal of provisioning. This attested to our quality asset-oriented 
organic growth and industry-leading risk management capabilities. In 
particular, we’ve maintained a proactive risk management approach. 
Following the additional KRW 377 billion provisioning for loan losses last 
year,  we  have  reclassified  the  soundness  of  some  loans  related  to 
COVID-19 based on a conservative economic outlook scenario for this 
year, setting aside a KRW 264 billion as additional provision for credit 
losses to buffer future uncertainties.Group credit cost was 0.30%, up slightly from the previous year due to 
additional provisioning for COVID-19 risks in the fourth quarter and 
provisioning for risks related to adopting a new credit rating model at KB 
Kookmin Card. On a recurring basis excluding these one-off provisionings, 
however, the Group credit cost stood at 0.21%, remaining steadily 
between the 20 basis-point range over the last five years.By subsidiary, KB Kookmin Bank’s net profit for 2021 grew by KRW 293 
billion year-on-year to reach KRW 2,591 billion. This was made possible 
by the solid growth in loan assets, improved NIM, additional net income 
from the newly acquired Prasac and PT Bank KB Bukopin, and the net 
fee & commission income growth led by trust and IB commission income. 
Despite the asset growth and the reduced reversal of provisioning, the 
Bank’s provision for credit loss increased a mere KRW 39 billion from the 
previous year to KRW 523 billion. This attests to our qualitative growth 
and industry-leading risk management capabilities. The prolonged 
pandemic gave rise to some concerns regarding the Bank’s asset quality. 
In preemptive preparation for these uncertainties and to improve our 
responsiveness, we have provisioned an additional KRW 181 billion for 
the year 2021, securing a buffer against credit loss risks. Meanwhile, we 
have prudently stepped up our risk management efforts and reinforced 
the risk management system by industry and borrower type whilesimultaneously  enhancing  our  monitoring  of  weak  borrowers.  As  of 
2021, The bank credit cost sustained its low level at 0.11%. The Bank’s 
G&A expenses amounted to KRW 4,403 billion, up KRW 202 billion from 
the previous year, primarily due to the M&A effects of Prasac and Bank 
KB Bukopin. The Bank CIR stably remained at 52.2%, as the Groupwide 
cost management and workforce efficiency efforts materialized.KB Kookmin Bank Profitability Overview(bn won, %)Net Interest Income

12.8In 2021, KB Securities’ net profit recorded a historic high of KRW 594 
billion, up KRW 168 billion from the previous year. This is largely attributable 
to the substantial growth in IB commissions and brokerage fees from 
the increase in large-scale IPO deals and the stock market boom, as 
much as it is thanks to a KRW 100 billion increase in S&T performance, 
which overcame the previous year’s struggle. By business sector, WM 
boosted its earnings performance with growing brokerage fees thanks 
to the bull markets at home and abroad, along with practical efforts to 
expand retail customer market share, pushing the Prime Club service. 
The  IB  sector  successfully  closed  several  large-scale  IPO  deals  and 
profited from PI investments. As a result of its consistent endeavors to 
build IB competencies, the IB sector is building its market position not 
only in DCM but also in ECM and M&As. The S&T sector significantly 
restored  its  performance,  which  had  faltered  with  the  rising  financial 
volatility  stemming  from  the  protracted  COVID-19  pandemic.  In  the 
future, we will maintain the position in response to the fluctuating stock 
market and interest rates and diversify the investment strategy to sustain 
profitability.038INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONKB Insurance’s net profit for 2021 posted KRW 302 billion, growing by a 
significant KRW 125 billion from the previous year. This is mainly due to 
the rise in premium income and the improvements in auto insurance loss 
ratio from the decrease in car accidents and improved investment gains 
through  resilient  asset  portfolio  rebalancing.  In  particular,  with  the 
exclusion of one-off factors such as the ERP expenses, the recurring-
based net profit was KRW 333 billion, which is a sign of the gradual 
recovery in its earnings fundamental. Meanwhile, at the end of 2021, the 
direct premiums written rose by 5.0% from the previous year to KRW 
11,524 billion, and the embedded value (EV) reached KRW 7.8 trillion. In 
2021, the loss ratio recorded 84.9%, down 0.6%p from the previous year 
due to the improved auto insurance loss ratio.KB Kookmin Card’s net profit for 2021 amounted to KRW 419 billion, a 
KRW 94 billion growth from the previous year as the card transaction 
volume  increased  due  to  consumption  recovery  and  continued  cost-
efficiency efforts across the board. In 2021, the credit card transaction 
volume steadily grew by KRW 13.3 trillion year on year to reach KRW 157 
trillion. There are mounting concerns regarding risks of deteriorating 
profitability due to lower card merchant fees, higher funding costs, and 
asset  quality  risks.  However,  we  will  expand  recruitment  of  new 
memberships and strengthen our membership management to further 
develop the credit card transaction volume while improving profitability 
through  profit-driven  marketing  and  accelerating  new  business 
exploration.Prudential Life reported a sound net profit of KRW 336 billion in 2021 as 
a result of the decrease in operating expenses, which is attributable to 
the contracting sales of protection-type insurance outpaced by increasing 
sales of savings and annuity insurance across the industry.Net Profit by Subsidiaries(bn won, %)Group Asset Quality1)(bn won, %)Group Net Profit 1)

prudent and preemptive risk management efforts against the uncertainties 
of the prolonged COVID-19. Group NPL coverage ratio was 208.9%, and 
the NPL coverage ratio, including reserves for credit losses, stood at 
433.3%, up 40.3%p and 87.4%p, respectively, from the previous year. This 
attests to the Group’s stable management of asset quality indicators with 
enhanced TLAC against economic headwinds going forward. In preparing 
for the future, we will hold to a preemptive and conservative risk 
management policy and cautiously reinforce the TLAC to maintain the 
level of our asset quality in the future.107.90.690.610.490.410.3320172018201920202021NPL ratioNPL coverage ratio039INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONKB Kookmin Bank’s NPL ratio and delinquency rate stood at 0.20% and

The NPL Coverage Ratio remained at a whopping 225.3%, which helped 
secure competitive TLAC to hedge against future unpredictability.KB Kookmin Card’s NPL and delinquency ratios stood at 0.96% and

In 2021, KB Kookmin Bank developed its platform-focused organization to emerge as a No. 1 financial 
platform company most trusted by customers. Since our 2021 organizational overhaul into a platform-focused 
organization, fusing business and technology units together, the DevOps culture has taken hold across the board, 
as it coordinates effectively between planning, development, and operations. In a bid to successfully transition 
into a platform-focused organization, the Bank conducted the KB Agile Coaching program on key digital services 
to internalize the agile development experience within the organization while creating a new Agile Build Team to 
monitor its progress in becoming ‘agile’. In 2022, KB Customer Experience Design Center and KB Digital Contents

with more subsidiaries and upload non-financial content to generate synergistic effects with the existing financial 
services to become even more competitive as a comprehensive, top-performing financial platform.KB MyData Service Knows Me Better than I Do

In November 2021, KB Kookmin Bank launched Liiv Next, a financial platform especially designed for the 
interests of Generation Z (the 14-25-year-old demographic), which constitutes the up-and-coming consumer 
base. Liiv Next is a financial platform geared to help those of generation Z get their financial lives off to a good 
start, offering customized financial services, along with intriguing non-financial content. In particular, we have 
opened up the service barriers that teens had previously encountered by allowing them to enroll in the Liiv 
Pocket service, a prepaid electronic payment model, devoid of complicated procedures. The Liiv Pocket service 
is customized to the particular financial needs of Generation Z, such as fee-free money transfers, ATM cash 
withdrawals, card-free digital KB Pay service, and CVS money-charging services. Their financial transactions 
generate virtual rewards, such as virtual stickers for decorating budget journals on the Liiv Next app or paying 
for actual goods at preset exchange rates. ‘Liiv Next’ will continue to add more products and content that 
will link it to KB Financial Group and offer AI-based financial services to bring about innovative financial 
experiences for Gen Z.042INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONNextA financial platformfor the up-and-comingconsumer base,

The KB Mobile Certification is a private authentication certificate released in July 2019. As of December 2021, 
its subscription surpassed 9.6 million. Unlike public authentication, which requires tedious revalidations, the 
KB Mobile Certification can be issued on the KB Star Banking following simple steps in no time and supports 
the entire contactless process - from login to transfers and new product enrolments. In 2021, the certification 
realized the single sign-on (SSO) service that makes it compatible with the platforms of KB Financial Group’s five 
subsidiaries—KB Insurance (Jan. 12), KB Life Insurance (June 8), KB Kookmin Card (Sept. 2), KB Savings Bank (Oct. 
8), and KB Securities (Dec. 29). This innovation allows users to effortlessly access these platforms with just a single 
log-in from the KB Star Banking app. Most importantly, KB Securities’ M-able app, where the significance of real-
time stock trading is crucial, features a simple log-in function, enabling all transactions, including stock trading, 
without the hassle of additional authentications. In October 2021, the KB Mobile Certification earned the license 
for Digital Signature Authentication from the Ministry of Science and ICT, making it compatible with any MyData 
integrated authentication agencies. The KB Mobile Certification is also enjoying increased market presence as 
52 public institutions employ it for simple authentication services.KB Real Estate Service Brings Together Real Estate Information 
In February 2021, KB Liiv Real Estate service to enhance scalability and add cutting-edge content to the existing 
real estate finance platform Liiv ON, rebranding it as KB Real Estate in November 2021 to raise brand awareness. 
KB Real Estate service pulls together a collection of real estate pricing information to a single screen on the 
app, bringing all real estate information just a click away, including photos/videos of apartment complexes 
and user comments. KB Real Estate also produces and provides its own real estate content through social media 
channels (Korean popular portal sites, including Naver and Kakao, as well as YouTube, Facebook, Kakao TV, and 
Naver TV). In 2022, we plan to collaborate with startups to cumulate big data for real estate, and we will focus 
on expanding our user base by upgrading the market trends and statistical data that provide the sort of in-vogue 
content unique to KB Real Estate.KB One Cloud for Agile Digital Transformation
In November 2021, KB Kookmin Bank established KB One Cloud for the integrated management and operation 
of the Group’s cloud system. The integrated system streamlined the complex procurement process for adopting anew cloud system, which also rendered the operation of cloud resources more efficient. Presently, KB One Cloud 
harbors all of the developing initiatives of the Bank’s Liiv Next platform and the KB MyData Service, as well as the 
Group’s Future Contact Center and the projects of KB Savings Bank. In 2022, we plan to build an integrated 
monitoring system to ensure stability in system operation and gradually upload the existing IT systems to the 
cloud platform.Retail BankingKB Kookmin Bank ranked first in the banking sector in the 2021 National Customer Satisfaction Index (NCSI) for 15 
years in total—a first among commercial banks.Customer Value-driven Total WM Services
KB Kookmin Bank aims to offer customer value-oriented total wealth management services by leveraging its 
exceptional financial expertise. To this end, we spent the whole of 2021 developing the required infrastructure - 
upgrading our WM channel operations, opening a data-based personal finance management (PFM) platform, 
and reinforcing our advisory service infrastructure.First, we worked to enhance customer value on our WM channel operations. We realigned the business models 
of the PB Center/VIP Lounge with the Bank’s channel strategy “PG 2.0”, and differentiated our WM channel 
operations by customer segment. Our face-to-face channel operations were reinforced with the addition of 
several WM centers. The number of branch-in-branch PB centers has grown from two centers in 2020 to seven in 
2021. The VIP Lounge Reservation Service has become available at 96 branch offices in 2021, almost double that 
of the 50 in 2020. Also in 2021 alone, six new WM hybrid branches commenced their one-stop total WM services 
covering the Groupwide core businesses.Second, we launched a new WM Asset Management Platform for “All-in-One” and “All-for-One” wealth 
management services. The platform proposes hyper-personalized investment portfolios for customers based on 
its ‘WMTI (Wealth Management Type Indicator)’, an in-house developed data-driven customer analysis model. It 
also provides WM solutions based on an algorithm that draws on KB Financial Group’s own AI platform called the 
KB Digital Asset Management (KB DAM), which combines with the expertise of our experienced WM specialists. 
Although the WM Asset Management Platform currently only supports our branch office staff with their customer 
consultations, it will migrate into contact-free service on the KB Star Banking app.Lastly, we bolstered our advisory service infrastructure. We expanded digital WM content, including investment 
strategy-building and market trend outlooks. We also held webinars on wealth management topics pertinent to 
the interests of our customers, such as tax law amendments and real estate regulations. KB Financial Group’s 
expert WM Star Advisory Group grew in size and service scope as new subsidiaries joined the panel.In 2022, we will focus on further expanding our customer touchpoints. WM platforms will be upgraded to reinforce 
our contactless services. We remain agile to shifting financial trends and consumer interests to preemptively 
roll out the specific services that customers need most. In order to reinforce our core competencies, we will 
fully innovate our WM product lineup and fine-tune the WM channels and our financial capability to deliver an 
unprecedented customer experience.043INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONCompetitive Edge with Enhanced Contactless Marketing 
As customer demand for contactless financial transactions continues to rise, the competition within financial 
markets only intensifies. KB Kookmin Bank, led by its head departments, reinforced its zero-contact marketing 
campaigns. A Cross-Functional Agile Team came into operation to oversee our contactless marketing efforts, 
and the Team developed a new systematic and agile marketing process. We have also established a system to 
integrate marketing management as a foundation for personalized marketing and applied a data-based approach 
to measure marketing effects, which helped refine our target marketing approach. To tap into the customer base 
of our subsidiaries, we strengthened collaborative marketing on the platforms of our subsidiaries and promoted 
practical marketing activities. Meanwhile, the Group’s loyalty program, KB Star Club, enhanced its system and 
renewed its customer benefits plan, KB Star Dream service, to offer more practical customer perks.The competition in the loan market is quite intense as companies jockey to gain the upper hand in the emerging 
paradigm that favors contactless financial transactions. We at KB Kookmin Bank also threw our hat in the ring with 
the launch of our “All-In-One” household lending system, which is essentially an updated edition of our existing 
contact-free household lending service. The sophistication of the new All-In-One system incorporates our 
decade-old expertise in household lending with our advanced IT infrastructure. The platform not only expanded 
contactless loan products and services but also incorporated the credit review process into the mobile platform, 
thanks to our seamless transfer system. Additionally, the intuitive UI/UX and ChatBot consultation services have 
significantly enhanced the useability and convenience of the household lending process.In order to achieve differentiated product competitiveness that distinguishes us from our competitors, we created 
an E-Mart National Fund for cross-industry affiliate marketing. To harness Groupwide synergy, we introduced new 
cooperative products with our subsidiaries, including the ONE KB Business Owner Plan, KB Green Wave 1.5°C 
Time Deposit, and KB Happy Pet Life Installment Savings Plan.In 2022, KB Kookmin Bank will gain a competitive edge by providing an unparalleled customer experience. 
Specifically, we plan to further upgrade our customer management through the loyalty program, develop a 
strategic product management system and offer personalized products, reinforce our omnichannel marketing, 
continue to nurture our core businesses, and build our capability in providing a distinctive customer experience.Investment BankingIn 2021, KB Kookmin Bank focused on developing its global IB competencies in light of market changes in the 
aftermath of COVID-19. We have established a mid-and long-term roadmap for our growth trajectory into a 
global IB and improved our IB infrastructure to be on par with that of global standards for rapid decision-making 
and implementation. Establishing the IB Unit in Singapore assisted us in extending our IB coverage. We also 
inspected our offshore alternative investment vehicles for potential issues as part of systematic risk management 
to hedge against volatility within global economies. Our consistent endeavors toward investment-oriented IB 
portfolio management began to generate tangible results in non-interest profits from our alternative investments 
in securities. Most notably, KB Kookmin Bank led the league tables in Syndicated Loans (Bloomberg) and in M&As 
(The Bell) in 2021.In the meantime, KB Kookmin Bank has continued its work on ESG projects. We launched the KB New Deal 
Infrastructure Fund as a cooperative product with our subsidiaries in compliance with the government’s New DealRanked firstin The Bell M&A leaguetable for 2021Ranked first in the Bloombergsyndicated loan arrangersleague tablefor 2021policy. We’ve also been actively involved in renewable energy initiatives and smart city projects as part of our ESG 
investment and project financing activities. In particular, our IB sector assimilated the Equator Principles while 
we proactively participated in the Group’s carbon neutrality initiative, KB Net Zero S.T.A.R., solidifying our leading 
position in ESG management.In 2022, KB Kookmin Bank will continue evolving into one of the top global players, in line with the top three 
priority IB strategies: investment-oriented IB, global IB, and new businesses. More specifically, we established 
a goal—lead in the Bloomberg Korea League Table, rank fifth in the APAC League Table, and place 30th in the 
Global League Table. We will overhaul our revenue structure to attain these goals and shift from the traditional 
spread-based revenue structure into one that is global and ESG-oriented. To foster our investment-oriented IB 
business, we will increase blind fund seeding and alternative investments while leveraging our relationships with 
global top-tier asset managers to bolster our arrangement competencies. In securing our position as a global 
CIB player, we employ a two-track strategy that prioritizes differentially on investment banking (IB) for developed 
markets and corporate banking (CB) for emerging markets. To expand our IB operations in developed markets, we 
will size up the IB operational units in New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, and London. In the emerging markets of 
Southeast Asia, we will expand the Korea Desk to extend our CB operations into local markets. As far as new ESG-
oriented businesses go, we will implement a Groupwide initiative to ensure new growth engines through active 
participation in policy-driven projects, such as the K-New Deal, the Smart City, and the Hydrogen Economy. With 
these initiatives, we will leverage our market dominance to become a leading financial institution in Korea’s ESG 
finance market.SME BankingIn 2021, the Korean government’s policy focused on channeling funding into “productive finance” to promising 
SMEs at the forefront of innovative technology. KB Kookmin Bank embraced the policy with a net increase of 
KRW 10.5 trillion in SME loans in 2021, sustaining its largest market share among commercial banks. Of this, loans 
to prime SME borrowers accounted for 81.2%, up by 1.9%p from the 79.3% figure in 2020. The delinquency rate 
also remained a stable 0.11% as of the year.044INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONNo. 1 Corporate Banking Platform 
KB Kookmin Bank has overhauled its services to evolve its Corporate Banking Platform into a customized business 
management platform. First, the Corporate Banking Platform incorporated the cash management service Star 
CMS and the non-financial business support solution app KB Bridge into its services. It also features some 
business management solutions for SMEs and microenterprises from an external platform company to prepare for 
the big tech’s entry into the SME market. Meanwhile, we are involved in a project to digitalize the entire process 
of corporate banking services—from corporate loan applications to follow-on management—in addition to AI-
based automation for credit reviews and mortgage assessment procedures. Also worth noting is our Corporate 
Financial ACE app that assists in the process of outbound sales and marketing so that corporate borrowers can 
maximize the advantages of our marketing and enhance their efficiency in corporate banking operations.Marketing to Institutional Clients
Institutional client marketing at KB Kookmin Bank began in 2010. Successfully making headway into the 
market known for its exceptionally high entry barrier, KB Kookmin Bank performs the vaulting work for various 
municipalities such as Gyeonggi-do, Chungcheongnam-do, Busan City, and Gwangju City. The Bank is also 
the primary bank for prominent institutions such as the Korea Water Resources Corporation and Sangmyung 
University. This kind of clientele helps the Bank solidify its position in the institutional client market. In 2021, we 
continued to increase our market share with back-to-back agreements with new prime customers. We are now 
the vault bank for Euisung-gun, Bucheon-si, and Guri-si, and the primary bank for Sejong University and Korail 
Logis. Furthermore, we are actively engaging in marketing activities to promote collateral transactions with these 
clients as well as marketing for the employees of these institutions, thereby achieving balanced qualitative growth 
in both corporate and retail banking. In 2022, we have been developing an institutional customer relationship 
management system to further enhance our capabilities to serve these customers. We will also expand our 
market presence in the institutional customer market through additional agreements with prestigious institutions 
and through diversifying our business areas.Augmenting Contactless Forex Services 
We have strengthened our contactless forex services in step with the “untact” trend and growing customer 
needs. We have completely revamped the forex internet banking service into one that is user-oriented. KB 
Global Payment Usance, an import finance service that had before only been available at our brick-and-mortar 
locations, debuted on the Internet banking platform and achieved an impressive performance result of USD 
680 million, or a 971% year-over-year growth. In 2022, our marketing initiatives will focus on import/export 
companies as demand for T/F transactions is expected to increase from the growing international trade volumes 
and rising exchange rates.SME-customized Social Contribution Activities
In 2021, KB Kookmin Bank provided more than 6,100 free consulting services to SOHOs and microbusinesses 
struggling in the midst of COVID-19 through our 13 SOHO Consulting Centers nationwide, including the Hub 
Center in Yeouido. In addition, we hosted five KB Good Job Fairs throughout the year to support SMEs and Middle 
Market Enterprises with recruitment and address youth unemployment issues. In 2022, we will further our role as 
an ESG leader by expanding contactless consulting for SOHOs and utilizing our networks with institutional clients 
to open job opportunity prospects for marginalized regions.Capital MarketsIn 2021, KB Kookmin Bank focused on effective risk management to hedge against rising volatility in the financial 
markets and laid the foundation for its advance into global capital markets. We prepared for the digitalization of 
asset management operations with a new platform for AI-based asset management and e-capital markets. These 
endeavors helped reinforce our global business operations. The London Unit generated profits, and our new 
Singapore Unit is presently in full operation, while another Unit in New York is in the pipeline.In 2022, we will strive to further our domestic market power while reinforcing our overseas profit base. We will 
pursue stable profits by focusing our investment capabilities on traditional businesses and optimizing our treasury 
system. We will also elevate our market power through innovation in the operations of capital markets, such as 
the AI-based asset management and E-Capital digital platforms.Even amid the protracted spread of the pandemic and the resultant rising volatility in the financial markets, KB 
Kookmin Bank successfully issued various sustainable debt instruments based on its highest credit ratings among 
Korean commercial banks, garnering significant interest from its investors. (Moody’s Aa3 (Stable), S&P A+ (Stable), 
Fitch A (Stable))In March 2021, the bank became the first Korean bank to successfully issue KRW 100 billion green bonds in line 
with the guidelines set by the Korean Ministry of Environment. We also have further increased transparency in 
the use of bond proceeds by obtaining an additional Second-Party Opinion from a domestic, independent 
ESG adviser.In April, we issued a USD 500 million five-year senior unsecured sustainability bond, attracting new demands 
from leading global institutional investors. Offered at 55 basis points over US five-year treasury bond yield, the 
sustainability bonds ended up with a final order book of USD 2.1 billion or 4.2 times the issue amount from over 
100 institutional investors.In October 2021, we successfully issued a EUR 500 million five-year covered bond in green bond format for the 
first time ever in Korea. Thanks to the large demands from global ESG bond investors, the bonds were priced at 
the lowest spread among the foreign currency-denominated covered bonds issued by Korean issuers. With 14 
basis points over five-year mid swap rate, the final pricing level was 0.048% which led to saving our funding cost 
compared to the issuance of senior unsecured bonds.As one of the leading ESG bond issuers, KB Kookmin Bank will continue to provide ESG bonds to the market in 
order to support green and social projects within the bank. In preparation for the cessation of the USD LIBOR, 
we have been diversifying funding formats. For example, we issued the first SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing 
Rate)-based bonds among Korean commercial banks. In addition, as part of the ALM policy, we will spearhead 
the promotion of the ALM/Treasury system through efficiently hedging the bank-wide mismatch position through 
capital market funding/investment means.PensionAs a lifelong financial partner, KB Kookmin Bank supports its customers in managing their valuable pension

retirement life solutions. Services range from healthcare and lifestyle news to leisure lifestyle activities, financial 
information, and retirement planning, under the motto, ‘a venue for the active and adventurous middle-aged 
“new Generation-X”’.Customer-oriented Product Lineups and Process Innovation 
KB Kookmin Bank is expanding its product lineup to broaden customer options for retirement pension plans. 
We provide ESG, eco-friendly funds, and defined-benefit (DB) plan funds. Furthermore, we have the longest 
list of alliance agreements in Korea, allowing for increased principal-protected investment (PPIs) offerings with 
competitive interest rates, such as ELB, GIC, and time deposit plans with savings banks. Additionally, KB Star 
Banking upgrades included intuitive UI; introducing the reserve management descriptions and an easily accessible 
IRP enrollment and retirement pension investment process. The DC Mobile Enrollment Service facilitates the 
process of signing up for DC Retirement Pension Plans and adjusting investment plans. Also, we were the first 
Korean bank to introduce a Free-to-Withdraw Pension Plan, an annuity payment program, allowing customers 
to withdraw from their funds at any time.In 2022, we will differentiate our pension investment services according to customer needs. We plan to provide 
corporate clients with Reserve Investment Plan Consulting and Customized Outsourced Chief Investment 
Officer (OCIO) services while strengthening individualized investment management services as well. In addition, 
the e-Vote system will streamline the process of introducing corporate retirement pension plans, and the KB 
Retirement Pension Headquarters Direct System will enable the contactless handling of retirement pension 
processes. For senior customers, KB Golden Life Center plans to adopt video-call consultation services for 
retirement asset management parallel to the services at our brick-and-mortar locations. Our contact-free 
channel, Golden Life X, will continue to align and cooperate with external benefits and strengthen pension/
retirement content to provide more specialized retirement asset management services. In addition, the KB 
Star Banking platform will bolster its retirement asset management service to offer differentiated online 
consultation solutions, such as Annuity Receipt Decision-making Assistance and Tax-Saving Assistance with 
Inheritance/Gift Taxes.TrustIn 2021, the seemingly-unending COVID-19 crisis, paired with deepening uncertainty in the global economy, 
drove customer sentiment to flock to risk-free assets, which inflated the market demand for direct investments. 
Also, the regulatory environment grew stringent with the enforcement of the Act on Financial Consumer 
Protection and the Standards for Banks’ Internal Control of Non-deposit Investment Product Sales. To prevent 
misselling practices, we established an AI financial counseling system and an integrated follow-on management 
system. These tools proved instrumental in the internal control of non-deposit product sales, enabling a one-stop 
process from product explanations to misselling case reviews. We increased our PPI product lineups, including 
ABSTB and hybrid bonds, to meet customer demand for low-risk investment vehicles while expanding our 
ETF product offerings in sync with the latest market trends, fueled by the restoring investment sentiments. As of 
November 2021, our monetary trust AUM stood at KRW 38.9 trillion, maintaining the industry’s top market share 
of 23.3%, and our ELT balance accounted for the industry’s largest market share of 42.9% at KRW 10.5 trillion. As 
such, KB Kookmin Bank sustained its industry-top position in terms of both its AUM size and its 2021 revenue.In 2021, we launched a variety of specialty trust products to meet the diverse needs of our customers: KB Great 
Legacy Trust is an integrated inheritance planning solution; the 3 to 1 ELT is a unique product designed to reduce 
potential losses; Contact ETF invests in businesses predicted to thrive in the post-COVID era; and Metaverse ETF 
invests in metaverse-related companies.Considering the market outlook on a gradual economic recovery in 2022, we will increase our sales for custom-
tailored ELTs and ETFs with high growth potential to improve profitability. Meanwhile, we will expand our product 
lineup for alternative investments, such as overseas real estate, and further develop our property trust sales to 
achieve sizeable growth in the trust AUM. To serve the rapidly aging population, we will expand our Living Trust 
operations for high net-worth individual (HNWI) customers. Down the road, we will lead the domestic asset 
management market through the innovations we make on our services, such as the creation of a unique Family 
Office business model and the establishment of a hybrid channel that combines face-to-face encounters with 
virtual media.046INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONGlobal Operation2022 PlansIn 2022, KB Kookmin Bank aims to become a customer-centric NO.1 financial platform that leads financial 
innovation and fulfills social responsibility. To this end, we’ve devised the following four strategic directions to 
perform our specific action plans.First, we will strengthen our core competencies. 
We will enhance the competitiveness of our deposit-taking and lending operations to secure a competitive 
edge in the market. We will use the MyData Service as a base to reinforce our customer-centric total financial 
solution offerings. We are determined to generate tangible results through ambitious advancement in the core 
growth business CIB/capital markets/WM (pensions and trusts)/global/platform business sectors.Second, we will augment competitiveness on our customer touchpoints. 
Contactless channels will enhance customer access as an open platform, while we will innovate our in-person

and modernize the customer management and marketing system.Third, we will internalize a sustainable management system.

management system to flexibly respond to shifting conditions in both the internal/external environment and 
strengthen cost and capital management to maximize our business management efficiency.Finally, we will overhaul the organizational management system. 
We will establish an enterprising corporate culture rooted in autonomy, trust, and ethics. We will modernize the 
platform-based organizational management model to share and implement the agile work culture. And the 
overall organization will become more flexible and open as we adopt a system for attracting outside talent and 
establish an open architecture infrastructure for our computer system.Stellar Accomplishments in Global Expansion Initiative 
In October 2021, KB Kookmin Bank purchased the remaining 30% stake of Prasac Microfinance Institution PLC, 
the largest microfinance deposit-taking institution (MDI) in Cambodia. The purchase completed the acquisition 
of the company as a 100% fully-owned subsidiary of KB Financial Group. We made full use of KB’s excellent 
creditability to arrange a global funding of the company so as to enhance the corporate value of our newly 
acquired subsidiary. Not surprisingly, our efforts have promoted the company to the top of Cambodia’s MDI 
industry, recording a net income of USD 155 million for 2021. KB Kookmin Bank plans to transform Prasac into 
a commercial bank. This transition will allow the company to expand its business scope, as we at KB Kookmin 
Bank will provide it with our key competencies and operational expertise to transform it into the largest financial 
institution in Cambodia.In December 2021, we issued new stocks to increase capital in PT Bank KB Bukopin, our medium-sized 
subsidiary bank in Indonesia. PT Bank KB Bukopin boasts an extensive network (356 branches as of the end of 
December 2021) across Indonesia, which brings along with it a solid local customer base. The bank has ample 
potential with a stable market position as the only local mid-and large-sized bank (BUKU3), in which the local 
government holds stakes. The latest capital increase will fund its business normalization initiatives, such as 
attracting new customers, improving asset quality, and bolstering the IT infrastructure. In the future, the bank 
will create synergy through cooperation with KB Financial Group’s subsidiaries in Indonesia to become a total 
financial group in Indonesia.Meanwhile, KB Kookmin Bank also continues to expand its retail banking network in Southeast Asia. KB 
Microfinance Myanmar opened branches in Hinthada and Taungoo in June 2021, which brings the tally to a total 
of 23 branch offices in the nation. The Bank is developing a unique business model that combines conventional 
microcredits with housing loans. It will also continue to broaden its sales network out of its current base in 
Yangon to surrounding regions such as Sagaing, and to Myanmar’s capital, Naypyidaw.Following the preliminary license obtained in April 2021, KB Kookmin Bank’s Singapore Branch commenced 
operations in January 2022. Our new presence in the global financial hub city will control our worldwide 
investments and financing as we grow our overseas network. Our presence in the four international financial 
hubs of Singapore, Hong Kong, New York, and London will provide an excellent vantage from which to cover the 
global capital markets around the clock. Each unit will complement one another to fortify our capabilities 
for CIB and capital markets operations. Meanwhile, in April 2021, we promoted the Hong Kong unit into an Asia 
Credit Review Center. With this, we expanded the coverage of our credit review from Hong Kong and China to 
Southeast Asia, India, and Oceania regions. Our plan is to move the Asia Credit Review Center to Singapore in 
the near future so as to pool our global financial capabilities.In 2022, we are considering further expansion into rapidly growing nations, such as Vietnam, and other 
unexplored markets where Korean companies outnumber Korean financial institutions in local presence, such as 
in the Middle East, South America, the Commonwealth of Independent State, and Africa.047INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONSecuritiesKB SecuritiesIn 2021, KB Securities recorded a historic-high net profit of KRW 594 billion.

upgrades to its IT system, so that several of these mega-sized IPOs, such as Kakao Bank, can be carried out with 
planned stability without any IT system failure or disruptions. In the rights offering deals, we served as a co-lead 
manager to successfully close mega-sized deals that raised funds of more than KRW 1 trillion, such as those for 
Korean Air, Hanhwa Solution, and POSCO Chemicals.Launching the MyData Service, Mable-in
KB Securities obtained the license of MyData Service from the Financial Services Commission in November 2021 
and launched the service under the name, Mable-in, in February 2022. The Mable-in is a financial platform

deposits with financial institutions to e-commerce transaction records, and even telecommunication and other 
lifestyle financial information. The Mable-in also taps into KB Securities’ 30-year experience and expertise in048INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONWM to provide customized financial investment services. Intuitive and accessible services of the MyData Service 
include: the Investment Appetite Self-checklist that scores users’ investment portfolio; the Guru’s Choice service 
that lists stock investment masters’ watchlists; and the Retirement Planning service, which assists users with their 
financial planning for retirement. KB Securities will continue developing its unique competitive edge in the MyData 
Service specialized in financial investments to take the lead in the digital asset management market.Launching the M-able Mini for Gen Z
In August 2021, KB Securities launched the mobile trading system, M-able Mini. While our flagship app service, 
M-able serves a wide range of investment interest levels—from stock-trading novices to stock investment 
masters, M-able Mini offers quick and convenient trading services with its intuitive UI/UX designs catering to the 
specific palates of Generation Z. The platform also features a live-streaming service that users can watch as they 
trade their stocks. The Pin Trading function allows users to “pin” particular prices to track price fluctuations in 
real-time while the Fractional Ownership Service facilitates the purchase of expensive overseas stocks in fractions. 
The Charging Mission Card saves mileage points in proportion to one’s mission accomplishments. M-able 
Mini’s amusing and convenient features were enthusiastically received with Generation Z consumers, recording 
more than 500,000 downloads in just four months of service. KB Securities intends to capitalize on its platform 
innovation to further expand its customer base.Global One Market: Offshore Stock Trading Service Surpasses 1 million in Subscriptions
KB Securities’ offshore stock trading service surpassed one million in subscriptions as of September 2021. 
Launched in January 2019, the Global One Market is an offshore stock trading platform that trades in Korean 
Won without foreign exchange. Its service markets cover the U.S. (NYSE and NASDAQ), China (SSEC), Hong 
Kong (HKEX), Japan (NIKKEI), and Vietnam (VN-Index). The popularity of the service can be attributed to its 
acceptance of deposits in Korean Won, allowing for cross-market transactions prior to stock settlements. KB 
Securities also lengthened its trading hours for U.S. stocks, making it more convenient for customers in navigating 
time differences and it also provided a fractional stock ownership service for offshore stocks. As a result of these 
customer service improvement initiatives, our overseas equity assets grew by 78% from the previous year to KRW 
5.4 trillion in 2021, and the revenues increased by 109% to KRW 60.6 billion for the year. Such successes clearly 
underpin why KB Securities will continue increasing customer access to offshore investments.Nurturing Global Business Operations
In pursuit of new growth engines, KB Securities continues to systematically expand its global business operations. 
Since its launch in 2017, KB Securities Vietnam has grown into one of the top 10 local securities firms. In 
December 2020, KB FINA, a local fintech subsidiary was established and has become a leader in the local financial 
platform market. KB Securities Hong Kong is expanding our offshore DCM operations. KBFG Securities America 
recorded KRW 14 trillion in in/outbound brokerage commitments, contributing to the global competencies of the 
headquarters’ Institutional Investor Relations. Currently, KB Securities is working to acquire Valbury Securities, 
one of Indonesia’s top 10 brokerage houses. When the integration is made complete in the first quarter of 2022, 
we will quickly develop the new subsidiary through synergies with KB Financial Group’s active subsidiaries in the 
Indonesian market.Reinforcing ESG Management
In 2020, KB Securities was the first Korean securities firm to launch the ESG Committee under its Board of 
Directors, demonstrating its solid commitment to ESG management. Since then, we have persisted to establishESG management as a financial investment company. As a result, KB Securities topped as an ESG bond issuance 
bookrunner in 2021. We also issued our first ESG bonds (raising KRW 110 billion as a result), beefed up our ESG 
financial investment lineups, and carried out renewable energy investments in that same year. Such endeavors 
also enabled us to score the highest grade of ‘A’ among securities firms, from the Korea Corporate Governance 
Service (KCGS) for the second consecutive year. It also received the highest ‘AA’ grade in the ESG evaluation by 
Sustinvest, a Korea-based ESG analytics & advisory service provider. KB Securities will build its ESG leadership as a 
reliable ESG partner to corporate investors.2022 Plans
The 2022 market outlook indicates greater volatility in the financial market due to the prolonged pandemic, 
inflationary pressures, and liquidity contraction in the domestic and international markets. In response, KB 
Securities has directed its 2022 management strategies to advance competency-driven business models, along 
with the strategic expansion of digital and platform business operations and will implement the following five 
key initiatives.First, we will augment our business models by strengthening our investment solution delivery capabilities.
Investment solution delivery capabilities are a key competency required in meeting our customer’s needs in all the 
business domains of WM, S&T, IB, as well as in institutional investor operations. We will develop our expertise in 
various business domains to exceed beyond the mere sales of financial products. In fact, we will recommend the 
optimal investment portfolios tailored to the specific needs of our customers.Second, we will bolster our investment and trading business competencies.
The capital investment business will strengthen their investment capabilities to increase profitability and capital 
efficiency. The customer asset management business will develop systematic investment competencies based on 
the new customer wealth management center to help customers cultivate their financial assets.Third, we will build up our global business competencies to expand our growth foundation.
In emerging markets such as Vietnam and Indonesia, we will reinforce the expertise of local subsidiaries and utilize 
the digital platform to increase our local mass customer base. As for advanced markets like Hong Kong and New 
York, we will solidify our revenue base through matrix collaboration with the business divisions at the headquarters.Fourth, we will assume a preemptive market position for future financing through strategic business expansion 
based on digital and platform operations.
We will grow our MTS into a total WM platform by redefining it as a total financial investment platform. In the 
same context, it will integrate the MyData Service to offer a more unique customer experience with KB Securities.Finally, we will advance our contingency plan against market volatility risks to solidify our market position as the 
most reliable financial investment company. By reinforcing our risk analysis competencies, we will establish a 
responsible and autonomous internal control system. Meanwhile, ESG management will be at the helm of our 
corporate social responsibility activities.049INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONInsuranceKB InsuranceKB Insurance continues to grow steadily toward the goal of becoming the most preferred insurer that provides optimal indemnity 
products and a one-stop financial consulting service. Obtaining an ‘A’ grade by A.M. Best for its superior financial soundness 
and management capabilities, KB Insurance became the first Korean insurer to establish a healthcare subsidiary, KB Healthcare, 
in 2021. It was also the first indemnity insurance company in Korea to obtain the MyData Service license, taking the lead in the 
market with its new growth drivers.Achieving a Remarkable Growth in Net Profit
KB Insurance’s net profit for 2021 reached KRW 302 billion, a significant increase of KRW 125 billion, or 70.6 
percent, year on year. This is mainly due to the impact of rising premiums and a decrease in car accidents, which 
has improved the auto insurance loss ratio and the investment gains from resilient asset portfolio rebalancing. The 
net premium earned was KRW 10,298 billion, an increase of 7.5% over the past year.Net Profit(bn won)Net Premium Earned(bn won)30210,2989,1919,577234177201920202021201920202021Long-term Insurance  
In 2021, KB Insurance continued launching innovative products, such as the new health technology collateral, 
expanding product lineups for those with preexisting medical conditions, and developing fourth-generation 
health insurance products. As a result, our market share for new protection policies accounted for 14.0%, up 
by 1.9% from the previous year. In addition, we have focused on revenue growth and balancing our profits and 
losses by establishing a Retention Contract Service Center, which spearheaded the retention management and 
policy remodeling marketing campaigns.Auto Insurance 
In 2021, auto insurance sales grew by 2.2% from the previous year to reach KRW 2,669 billion, with a market 
share of 13.2%. In particular, the direct CM channel sales demonstrated a robust 19.5% year-on-year growth 
to reach KRW 796 billion. The auto insurance loss ratio improved by 3.2%p from the previous year to 81.5% due 
to reduced traffic volume and serious car accidents.General Insurance 
Our sales of commercial lines reached KRW 1,108 billion in 2021, up by KRW 91 billion year on year. The loss 
ratio for the year edged up by 1.5%p to 85.4%. Albeit there were some major accidents affecting warehouse/
manufacturing factory contracts for property insurance along with deteriorated profitability in mobile phone 
insurance policies, we were able to slightly improve our loss ratio. We achieved this through more stringent risk 
management to cover the loss rates caused by natural disaster risks.Investment Asset Management 
Even with difficulties in realizing the gains on sales of bonds due to rising market interest rates in 2021, 
investment income rose by KRW 103 billion year on year to reach KRW 947 billion due to the increase in 
dividend income from alternative investments. We expanded our investments in foreign currency securities to 
increase our yield on AUM while hedging against interest rate risk exposure by aggressively rebalancing the050INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONtotal AUM portfolio. Specifically, the share of Won-denominated bonds in total AUM declined by 1.7%p. In 
contrast, the percentage of loan assets grew by 1.4%p, and the share of securities, including foreign currency 
securities, was also up by 1.2%p. As a result, the return on investment in 2021 was 3.01%, an increase of 0.15%p 
from 2.86% in 2020, and the AUM also expanded by 6.4% year on year to reach KRW 32,956 billion.Risk Management 
In 2021, the consolidated RBC ratio was estimated at 179.2%, up 4.4%p year on year due to the effects of net 
income and capital increase. The available capital rose by KRW 531.6 billion from the previous year to KRW 
4,343.6 billion, and the required capital stood at KRW 2,424.3 billion, a year-on-year growth of KRW 242.9 
billion. The Risk Management Committee convenes quarterly to decide on major risk-related issues, and the Risk 
Management Council gathers monthly to discuss key issues concerning each business operation. In light of the 
factors of the pandemic adversely affecting the economic and industrial outlook, we have fabricated a highly 
likely-to-occur internal scenario, and elaborated on the practical countermeasures that could address it, through 
stress testing the RBC ratio and internal capital solvency ratio. In addition, KB Insurance systematically conducts 
its Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA). This assessment paid off well as it earned us “High” grades in all 
nine categories and we were named for having the best practice in the Financial Supervisory Service’s ORSA for 
the insurance industry.Establishment of KB Healthcare 
In October 2021, KB Insurance established KB Healthcare, the first subsidiary established by an insurer for 
healthcare services. KB Healthcare will provide digital healthcare services, such as medical status data and 
diet data analysis, available for mobile apps. It will also pursue external partnerships for advanced healthcare 
services, such as genome analysis and mental wellness consultation programs. The main targets for the services 
are corporate customers in the initial stage of the operations and will expand to the mass market down the 
road. In any case, KB Insurance is fostering its future growth engines in the digital healthcare business to 
address increasing consumer needs for preventive healthcare.Full License for the MyData Service 
In November 2021, KB Insurance became the first in the indemnity insurance industry to obtain a MyData 
license from the Financial Services Commission (FSC). KB Insurance plans to build a MyData platform that 
combines financial and health data on its flagship platform, the KB Insurance app. It starts out as an open 
insurance service that offers an integrated analysis of insurance coverage for indemnity and life insurance and 
a one-stop claim service that can access any insurance subsidiary in the Group. In the future, we will develop 
an innovative service for personalized health-finance management that combines medical data and healthcare 
services with financial assistance. Based on the analysis of financial consumption patterns, we will provide 
life-friendly services based on microinsurance, such as travel, housing, and liability. In establishing such a 
differentiated position as an innovation platform, we aim to improve the daily lives of our customers.Digital Innovation for Improved Customer Convenience 
KB Insurance delivers a unique customer experience through digital transformation. In 2021, our smart 
insurance claim service was loaded on KB Kookmin Bank’s KB Star Banking app, improving customer 
convenience. As an upgrade of the existing mobile coverage analysis system, the KB Direct Coverage Analysis 
2.0 service introduced a distinctive user experience. KB Direct Coverage Analysis 2.0 allows customers to 
analyze their own insurance policies and reconfigure their insurance plans to match their own preferences.What is especially noteworthy is that it is a differentiated comprehensive consulting service that provides ease 
in insurance analysis with its in-house developed algorithms and provides individualized advice on insurance 
planning and guidance with healthcare information.2022 PlansThe resurging COVID variant has given rise to greater volatility in 2022, along with global supply disruptions, and 
rising inflation concerns. In grappling with such a challenging environment, KB Insurance remains steadfast in its 
commitment to put its customers first in all its business activities.First, we will proactively prepare for the IFRS17 and the K-ICS, which are slated for 2023. We plan to realign our 
management system with the IFRS17 standards and take a prudential risk management approach to enhance 
our corporate value.Next, we will strengthen the competitiveness of each business unit.  
Long-term insurance will lead the market with innovative products that combine coverage for critical 
illnesses, along with innovative health technologies. It will also enable the continued expansion of insurance 
premiums through insurance management by duration and category. Additionally, we will expand differentiated 
underwriting for hospitals, customers, and organizations with dubious claims and fine-tune our early warning 
detection systems for comprehensive profit management. Auto insurance will continue to improve its sales 
portfolio by expanding its direct sales revenue and will digitalize the compensation management procedures 
to enhance its process efficiency. We are also developing related products and pricing schemes, as well as 
EV-exclusive ratings, to proactively prepare for new markets in the lead-up to the launching of Level-3 
autonomous driving vehicles.We aim to achieve high growth in general insurance through portfolio restructuring and strengthening our 
price/underwriting competitiveness to establish a sustainable revenue generation structure and increase its 
market share to the second largest in the industry. In particular, we will develop a clear and differentiated 
portfolio strategy for the various needs of our customers, products, and markets.Finally, we will provide a differentiated customer experience through all-around digitalization and innovation. 
The MyData Service and KB Healthcare will spearhead our hyper-personalized services that combine financial 
and health data to secure unparalleled market competitiveness.051INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONInsurancePrudential Life InsurancePrudential Life was named the ‘Good Life Insurance Company’ by the Korea Finance Consumer Federation in 2021 for the 12th

the KB Financial Group. While delivering differentiated customer value to the affluent market, our main target 
segment, we laid the foundation to grow into the most credible premium insurer.confidence-inspiring level. More importantly, Prudential Life earned the highest rating, AAA, in the solvency ratio 
category from the Korea Investors Service for three consecutive years. Furthermore, we were named the ‘Good 
Life Insurance Company’ for the 12th straight year. The Korea Finance Consumer Federation annually assesses and 
awards financial companies for their financial stability, consumer-centric approach, soundness, and profitability.Even amid the challenging sales conditions that the contactless services imposed by way of the pandemic, 
Prudential Life achieved competitive business results: it recorded KRW 227 billion in converted monthly initial 
premium (CMIP), up by KRW 27 billion from the previous year; and a net profit of 336 billion. As of the end 
of 2021, the risk-based capital (RBC) ratio stood at an industry-leading 342.5%, by far exceeding the 100% 
recommended by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), which speaks to the stability of our financial standing. 
According to the quantitative impact study (QIS) of the new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS17), 
our RBC ratio recorded well above the capital requirements of the FSS in accordance with the new Korea Insurance 
Capital Standards (K-ICS) that go into effect in 2023. As such, we are keeping all the critical ratios well above aHighest AAAsolvency ratio for threeconsecutive yearsGood Life Insurance Company

leading Life Planners and KB Financial Group subsidiaries. The Star WMs are premium comprehensive 
finance professionals who provide personalized finance management (PFM) services to high-net-worth

We made headway in the non-variable pension market by diversifying into the Dollar Retirement Income Plan and 
Won Retirement Income Plan. As a result, our market share grew from 3.1% in 2020 to claim a 4.0% share of the 
variable pension market, the primary market of the GA channel. In addition, we promoted the sales of Executive 
Group Term Insurance Plans, expanding partnerships with the GAs of corporate markets. Also, our enhanced 
marketing directed at affluent customers helped us develop differentiated competitiveness, resulting in a 69% 
year-on-year growth in the high-profit policies generating KRW 1 million in CMIPs. As a result, Prudential Life is 
gradually expanding its GA market.Workplace Innovation in the Digital Era 
Prudential Life has built a Smart Office to realize an open and creative organizational culture through a flexible 
working environment in response to the digital and “untact” era. Under the motto, ‘Alter your surroundings 
if you need a change!’, we forged a horizontal and inclusive working atmosphere by embracing a flexible 
workspace concept in our office. We also augmented our offices’ digital and IT environments to make them more 
comfortable, and efficient and to facilitate remote/hybrid work, paperless meetings, and various collaboration 
tools. Digital transformation necessitates process innovation, and this is precisely what we did. In addition to the 
Smart Office, we have introduced flexible work shifts and work-from-home scheduling. In the future, Prudential 
Life will continue to embrace various changes in the way we work to create a self-directed and creative 
organizational culture.In 2022, we will lay the groundwork to develop as a life insurance-based premium financial platform. To this end, 
we will innovate our core business models of Life Planners and GAs to provide a valuable customer experience

deliver a hyper-personalized customer experience through our digital platforms, realizing high customer value.Third, we will revamp our business management process to achieve value-oriented business practices in 
preparation for the IFRS17, which will become effective in 2023. We are also developing systems and procedures, 
as well as impact studies, to maintain proactive risk management in preparation for the K-ICS.Fourth, we will adequately prepare for the road ahead. We will explore new growth drivers for future sustainable 
growth by pursuing the overseas life insurance market, along with business opportunities to diversify our long-
term revenue stream. Most importantly, we will train and foster future leaders, which serve as the most critical 
resources in attaining sustainable growth.Fifth, we will strengthen our responsible management for the creation of social value.

accessible to any mass customer at any place or time.Responsiveness to Regulatory Changes 
In preparation for the introduction of IFRS17, we have established a stable infrastructure and system to support 
executive decision-making. In anticipation of the new Korea Insurance Capital Standards (K-ICS), we have been 
continuously expanding our asset durations and have kept our RBCs above the recommended threshold. By 
employing various methodologies for an internal model-based approach to risk management, we are segmenting

also working with the Group’s subsidiaries and external FinTech firms to expand our ecosystem platform.2022 PlansIn response to the new normal brought on by the two-year-long global pandemic, the insurance industry is 
vigorously strengthening the competitiveness of its digital platforms. Also worth noting are the regulatory 
challenges the insurance business is facing: the Act on Financial Consumer Protection and the reform in the 
business expenses and solicitation commissions schemes that kick off in 2021; along with the IFRS17 and the 
K-ICS which are slated for 2023. In meeting these challenges, KB Life Insurance outlines the following strategies:First, we will achieve customer-centric growth. KB Life Insurance has achieved remarkable sales records over the 
past two years thanks to its convenient and accessible insurance products. Our consumer-oriented management 
that places customer value first enables us to strive further to brand the Company as an insurer that truly places

management efficiency, and further increase our corporate value for the future.Finally, we will continue our drive for ceaseless digital innovation. We will upgrade our data-driven system to 
establish an innovative digital platform and expand our digital operations. This will enable us to evolve into 
a leading digital insurance company that delivers a digital technology-driven hyper-personalized customer 
experience.In 2022, we at KB Life Insurance will all continue to drive innovation to expedite our transition into becoming the

In December 2021, KB Kookmin Card commenced its lifestyle MyData Service on its platform, Liiv Mate. 
In the lead-up to the service launch, we upgraded the app in 2020 and obtained the full license of the 
MyData business from the Financial Services Commission in January 2021. Liiv Mate offers services in three 
overarching categories: personal financial management, consumption analysis, and proposals. The Personal 
Finance Management (PFM) service allows users to intuitively pull their asset data from across several 
financial companies and conveniently view it all on one screen. The Consumption Analysis service evaluates 
a user’s monthly consumption patterns to offer personalized solutions, such as saving plan suggestions and 
recommendations for the optimal credit card according to individual consumption patterns. In particular, the 
TalkTalk Service offers personalized solutions, such as card product recommendations based on one’s asset 
and consumption data analysis. The Peer Comparison function allows users to cross-compare the status of 
their financial position with the averages of their peers (based on age, gender & residential community) and 
proposes PFM solutions. It also provides useful tips and information on travel, food, and culture that correspond 
to individual consumption patterns and interests based on the key data analysis of consumption history. KB 
Kookmin Card smartly integrates AI-based PFM solutions to its MyData Service to offer an advanced PFM 
service that touts the adage that this Card “knows me better than I do”.App Integration with KB Pay Renewal Open
In 2021, KB Kookmin Card undertook the endeavor to integrate its multiple app platforms into KB Pay, which 
was completely revamped with a new version by January 2022. The renewed KB Pay platform hosts the most 
frequently used functions of the KB Kookmin Card Mobile Home app, such as payments, card issue applications, 
and reporting, all of which optimize the UI/UX to customers’ credit card service use patterns. The new and 
convenient features also include: KB Pay Money, a prepayment modality that also allows users to transfer 
funds and/or make payments; Immediate Payment function, which allows cardholders to settle individual 
spendings in real-time while viewing the breakdown of their credit card payment history; Dutch Pay function, 
which conveniently allows a group to share the cost of an initial payment. Additionally, the KB Pay app also055INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONsynthesizes the KB Securities’ Debit Card function, adding to its competitiveness with open payments and

comprehensive financial platform able to converge with various industries.Issuing USD300 million Sustainability Bonds
In 2021, KB Kookmin Card successfully raised USD300 million in USD-denominated sustainability bonds, which 
was well received by the market on the strength of its creditability, sustainable growth potential, and asset 
soundness as a subsidiary of KB Financial Group. The bonds are five-year fixed-rate USD-denominated debts 
offering an annual interest rate of 1.50%, with spreads added to the US five-year treasury bond yield. With 60 
investors pledging to purchase the bonds for USD 1.1 billion at the proposal stage, we issued the bonds at an 
interest rate of 37.5 basis points lower than the initial pricing guidance (IPG). The raised funds will be spent on

payments negatively influenced the debt controls of credit information firms, leading to a drop of 15% in debt 
collections across the Group. Despite such a challenging business environment, our overall sales stood equal to 
those of the previous year as a result of our endeavors to maximize debt collections on limited resources. The 
loan delinquency and default rates of the Group subsidiaries remained low, contributing to the Group’s ability 
to keep its asset quality at a manageable level. In 2021, we generated KRW 27 billion in debt collection revenue 
from our debt collection services amounting to KRW 260 billion for the Group subsidiaries. It was a competitive 
performance result given the adverse business environment. Despite the government’s tighter mortgage 
regulations, the lease investigation revenue remained at KRW 12 billion, or 103% against the previous year, 
owing to the sales increase from the title search service for KB Insurance.Enhanced Debt Control Efficiency 
KB Credit Information established the DT Agile team in the second half of 2021 to improve the efficiency of 
its debt management. The DT Agile team developed an in-house model for monitoring debts held by banks 
and credit card subsidiaries in line with its debt collection strategy. The team also optimized the entire debt 
management process, including predicting and grading debt recoverability. As a result, we won the “Star of 
the Year 2021 Award” organized by KB Financial Group. In addition, we have made various efforts to enhance 
the proficiency and competitiveness of debt collection, including the active recruitment and nurturing of 
competent external debt collectors and differentiating promotions by debt type.2022 PlansThe government’s policy is predicted to continue protecting the underbanked throughout 2022. This is because 
such measures as the Financial Services Commission’s personal credit recovery support program and financial 
relief for the self-employed are here to stay. This policy brought up concerns about the rising risks concerning 
moral hazard debtors and the diminishing number of lease investigation orders under the Government’s real 
estate policy and the new Act on Financial Consumer Protection.In light of this, KB Credit Information will make the Group’s asset quality its top 2022 priority and focus on 
improving its financial structure to improve profitability.First, we will focus on reinforcing our debt management system and Groupwide collaboration. We will maximize 
the Groupwide recovery of debts and actively respond to the reduction in debt volume. Starting in January 
2022, we will begin a quality assurance (QA) service for the call center of KB Kookmin Card. Meanwhile, we 
will continue pursuing new revenue sources from peer subsidiaries, such as KB Insurance, KB Capital, and KB 
Savings Bank.Next, we will strengthen our debt management capabilities. We will actively adopt RPA and DT by modernizing 
the IT system to increase our debt management efficiency. Furthermore, we plan to enhance our productivity 
through cost reductions and streamline our workforce management to increase our capabilities through the 
improved performance of the debt management model. Finally, we will continue to develop and apply measures 
to tighten our control on delinquent debtors in line with the Korean financial consumer protection protocols.064INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONCompany DirectoryKB Financial Group Head Office (Holding Company)IR (Investor Relations)Global Strategy Department18~20F, 22F 141, Uisadang-daero, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul 07332,

KB Financial Group Inc.Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of KB Financial Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (“the Group”), which 
comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the consolidated statements of 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and notes, comprising significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information.In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial 
position of the Group as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash 
flows for the years then ended in accordance with Korean International Financial Reporting Standards (“K-IFRS”).Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audits in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing (KSAs). Our responsibilities under those standards 
are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements in the Republic of Korea, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.Emphasis of Matter
As a matter that does not affect our audit opinion, we draw attention to the following matter.As described in note 40.6.h) to the consolidated financial statements, the proliferation of COVID-19 has had a negative influence 
on the global economy, which may have a greater impact on expected credit losses and potential impairment of assets in a 
particular portfolio, and it could negatively affect the revenue generation capability of the Group.Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated 
financial statement as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. These matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.(1) Assessment of the allowances for credit losses for loansAs discussed in Notes 3.6, 4.2, 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group recognized an allowance for credit 
losses using the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) impairment model for loans at amortized cost amounting to KRW 3,684,055 million 
as of December 31, 2021. A lifetime ECL is recognized for those loans that have experienced a Significant Increase in Credit Risk 
(SICR)  since  initial  recognition  or  are  credit  impaired,  otherwise  a  12-month  ECL  is  recognized.  The  Group  measures  ECLallowances on an individual basis for individually significant corporate loans which are credit impaired and for those which have 
experienced a SICR and demonstrate certain other high risk indicators (for example, debt restructuring). The individual assessment 
involves judgment by the Group in estimating the future cash flows expected from collateral. The allowance for credit losses for 
other loans are measured on a collective basis. For these loans, the Group measures ECL based on its estimates of the Probability 
of Default (PD), the Loss Given Default (LGD) and the Exposure at Default (EAD) as well as the impact of Forward-Looking 
Information (FLI). For the corporate loans measured on a collective basis, one of the relevant inputs for determining PD is the 
internal credit risk rating of the borrower. The internal credit risk rating of the borrower is defined by the Group using quantitative 
and qualitative factors. The evaluation of the qualitative factors involves a high level of judgment by the Group.We identified the following risks in accordance with the assessment of the allowances for credit losses for loans as a key audit 
matter, considering likelihood of error, management judgement, and risk of material misstatement;∙  Risk that the Group’s estimation of future cash flows for the corporate loans to be individually assessed for ELC is inappropriatedue to over or under estimation of assets held as collateral by the Group∙  Risks that (i) the analysis of the qualitative factors in determining the internal credit risk ratings of the corporate loans to be 
collectively assessed for ELC is inappropriate; (ii) the calculation of 12 month and lifetime PD, the calculation of LGD, and the 
evaluation if FLI incorporated in the measurement of collective ECL is inappropriate due to fraud or errorThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter.∙  We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to: (i) the estimates of 
future cash flows for individually assessed corporate loans, including controls over the work of external valuation professionals 
engaged by the Group to assess the value of collateral; (ii) the validation of the models used to determine the inputs to the 
collective ECL calculation and the impact of FLI; (iii) the assessment of qualitative factors in the process of determining the 
internal credit risk rating of the loans; (iv) the completeness and accuracy of quantitative data used in the credit risk ratings; 
and (v) the process that the qualitative factors and quantitative data are applied to the internal credit risk rating by involving 
information technology professionals∙  We assessed the estimates of future cash flows expected from collateral on a sample of individually assessed corporate 
loans by (i) comparing assumptions made with information obtained from internal and external sources; and (ii) assessing 
the reliability of information used in the estimates, including the qualification of external valuation professionals engaged 
by the Group.∙  We involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills, industry knowledge and relevant experience who assisted in: (i) 
evaluating the methodology and key judgments used in determining the PD and LGD parameters; (ii) evaluating how FLI was 
incorporated in the collective ECL model; and (iii) recalculating forward-looking PD, and a sample of LGD.∙  We evaluated whether, for a sample of corporate loans with ECL measured on a collective basis, Group policy was applied inthe internal credit risk rating process.(2) Internally measured fair value of level 3 derivatives, and level 3 derivative-linked securitiesAs  discussed  in  Notes  3.3.2  and  6.1.2  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Group  classifies  financial  instruments 
measured at fair value using valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market data 
as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Those financial instruments measured at fair value classified as level 3 include derivatives 
and derivative-linked securities both held and issued by KB Securities Co., Ltd. (a subsidiary of the Group), of which fair value is 
measured by the internally developed valuation models. The fair value of such derivative assets and liabilities as of December070INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION31, 2021 was KRW 209,809 million and KRW 168,464 million, respectively. Also, the fair value of such derivative-linked securities 
held (presented as ‘financial assets at fair value through profit or loss – debt securities’) and issued (presented as ‘financial 
liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss’) as of December 31, 2021 was KRW 128,083 million and KRW 7,829,041 
million, respectively. In order to measure the fair value of these financial instruments, the Group uses valuation models such as 
discounted cash flow models and option models. These models use various inputs and assumptions, depending on the nature 
of the financial instruments.We identified the following risks in accordance with the measurement of fair value of the derivatives and derivative-linked 
securities as a key audit matter considering the level of judgement;∙  Risks that (i) the models used by the Group to value the level 3 financial instruments are inappropriate; (ii) the models’ 
significant inputs which are not directly observable in financial markets, (such as volatility of underlying assets, correlations, 
regression coefficients, discount rates, etc.) are inappropriateThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter.∙  We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the measurement of 
fair value of the derivatives and derivative-linked securities. This included controls related to (i) the development, validation 
and changes in the models used to value derivatives and derivative-linked securities, (ii) the development and application of 
the  significant  unobservable  inputs  and  assumptions  used  in  the  measurement  of  fair  values,  and  (iii)  the  monitoring  of 
changes to these inputs and assumptions.∙  We  involved  valuation  professionals  with  specialized  skills  and  knowledge,  who  assisted  in:  (i)  evaluating  the  valuation 
techniques and significant unobservable inputs on a selection of the derivatives and derivative-linked securities; and (ii) 
developing models and significant unobservable inputs independently for a selection of the derivatives and derivative-linked 
securities and comparing the resulting fair value estimates to the Group’s fair value measurements.Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial StatementsManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with K-IFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial StatementsOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with KSAs will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with KSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout 
the audit. We also:∙  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate toprovide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.∙  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate inthe circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.∙  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and thereasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.∙  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on 
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.∙  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation.∙  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the 
Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in the internal controls that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.From  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged  with  governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of  most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Young-Min Kwon.KPMG Samjong Accounting Corp.

Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
December 31, 2021 and 20201. The Parent Company 
 
KB  Financial  Group  Inc.  (the  “Parent  Company”)  was  incorporated  on  September  29,  2008,  under  the 
Financial Holding Companies Act of Korea. KB Financial Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) derive 
substantially all of their revenue and  income from  providing a  broad range of banking and related financial 
services  to  consumers  and  corporations.  The  Parent  Company’s  main  business  purpose  is  to  control 
subsidiaries  that  engage  in  the  financial  business  or  subsidiaries  closely  related  to  the  financial  business 
through the stock ownership. The Parent Company's headquarter is located at 26, Gukjegeumyung-ro 8-gil, 
Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul. In 2011, Kookmin Bank spun off its credit card business segment and established a 
new  separate  credit  card  company,  KB  Kookmin  Card  Co.,  Ltd.  and  KB  Investment  &  Securities  Co.,  Ltd. 
merged  with  KB  Futures  Co.,  Ltd.  The  Group  established  KB  Savings  Bank  Co.,  Ltd.  in  January  2012, 
acquired Yehansoul Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in September 2013, and KB Savings Bank Co., Ltd. merged with 
Yehansoul Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in January 2014. In March 2014, the Group acquired Woori Financial Co.,

became  one  of  the  subsidiaries  through  a  tender  offer  in  May  2017.  Also,  the  Group  included  Hyundai 
Securities  Co.,  Ltd.  as  an  associate  in  June  2016  and  included  as  a  subsidiary  in  October  2016  by 
comprehensive exchange of shares. Hyundai Securities Co., Ltd. merged with KB Investment & Securities Co., 
Ltd. in December 2016 and changed its name to KB Securities Co., Ltd. in January 2017. In August 2020, the 
Group acquired Prudential Life Insurance Company of Korea Ltd., which was classified as a subsidiary. 
 
The Parent Company’s share capital as of December 31, 2021, is ₩ 2,090,558 million. The Parent Company

authorized in its Articles of Incorporation is 1,000 million. 
 
 
2. Basis of Preparation 
 
2.1 Application of Korean IFRS 
 
The  Group  maintains  its  accounting  records  in  Korean  won  and  prepares  statutory  consolidated  financial 
statements  in  the  Korean  language  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  as 
adopted by the Republic of Korea (“Korean IFRS”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements have 
been translated into English from the Korean language consolidated financial statements. 
 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Korean  IFRS. 
Korean IFRS are the standards and related interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (“IASB”) that have been adopted by the Republic of Korea. 
 
The  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  requires  the  use  of  certain  critical  accounting 
estimates.  Management  also  needs  to  exercise  judgment  in  applying  the  Group’s  accounting  policies.  The 
areas that require a more complex and higher level of judgment or areas that require significant assumptions 
and estimations are disclosed in Note 2.4.075INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION076INTRODUCTIONCORE COMPETENCYGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries

December 31, 2021 and 20202.1.3 The following new and amended standards have been published that are not mandatory for December 
31, 2021 reporting period and have not been adopted by the Group. (cont’d) 
 
- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1001 Presentation of Financial Statements - Classification of Liabilities as 
Current or Non-current 
 
The  amendments  clarify  that  liabilities  are  classified  as  either  current  or  non-current,  depending  on  the 
substantive rights that exist at the end of the reporting period. Classification is unaffected by the likelihood that 
an entity will exercise the right to defer settlement of the liability or the management’s expectations thereof. 
Also, the settlement of liability includes the transfer of the entity’s own equity instruments; however, it would be 
excluded if an option to settle the liability by the transfer of the entity’s own equity instruments is recognized 
separately from the liability as an  equity component  of a compound financial instrument.  The amendments 
should be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and earlier application is 
permitted. The Group does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the consolidated 
financial statements. 
 
- Issuance of Korean IFRS No.1117 Insurance Contracts 
 
(a) Major changes in accounting policy 
 
Korean  IFRS  No.1117 Insurance  Contracts will  replace  Korean  IFRS  No.1104 Insurance  Contracts.  This 
standard  requires  an  entity  to  estimate  future cash  flows  of  an  insurance  contract  and  measure  insurance 
liabilities  using  discount  rates  applied  with  assumptions  and  risks  at  the  measurement  date  and  recognize 
insurance revenue on an accrual basis including services (insurance coverage) provided to the policyholder 
by  each  annual  reporting  period. In  addition,  investment  components  (refunds  due  to  termination  and 
maturity) repaid  to  a  policyholder  even  if an  insured  event  does  not  occur,  are  excluded  from  insurance 
revenue, and net insurance income and net investment income are presented separately to enable users of 
the information to understand the sources of net income. This standard should be applied for annual reporting 
periods  beginning  on  or  after  January  1,  2023,  and  earlier  application  is  permitted  for  entities  that  applied 
Korean  IFRS  No.1109 Financial  Instruments. The  Group  is  scheduled  to  apply  this  standard  for  annual 
reporting  period beginning on January 1, 2023. If  the Group prepares consolidated financial statements  by 
applying  Korean  IFRS  No.1117,  the  following  parts  are  expected  to  make  significant  differences  with  the 
current consolidated financial statements. It does not mean to include all differences that are arising in the 
future and can be changed based on the future additional analysis results. 
 
(Measurement of Insurance liabilities, etc.) 
 
Under Korean IFRS No.1117, the Group estimates all cash flows from insurance contracts and measures the 
insurance liabilities using discount rate that reflects assumptions and risks at the reporting date. 
 
In details, the Group identifies a portfolio of insurance contracts that comprises contracts exposed to similar 
risks  and  managed  together,  then  separates  the  contracts  with  similar  profitability  within  the  portfolio  as 
groups of insurance contracts. The groups of insurance contracts are measured as the sum of the estimate of 
future cash flows (including cash flows related to policy loans and reflecting time value of money, etc.), risk 
adjustment, and the contractual service margin. With the adoption of Korean IFRS No.1117, account of the 
contractual  service  margin  will  be  introduced,  which  means  unearned  profit  that  would  be  recognized  by 
providing insurance service in the future.2.1.3 The following new and amended standards have been published that are not mandatory for December 
31, 2021 reporting period and have not been adopted by the Group. (cont’d) 
 
Meanwhile, reinsurance contracts mean insurance contracts issued by a reinsurance company to compensate 
claims  arising  from  original  insurance  contracts  issued  by  other  insurance  companies.  The  groups  of 
insurance contracts also apply assumptions consistent with the groups of original insurance contracts when 
estimating the present value of future cash flows for the groups of insurance contracts ceded. 
 
(Recognition and measurement of financial performance) 
 
Under  Korean  IFRS  No.1117,  the  Group  recognizes  insurance  revenue  on  an  accrual  basis  for  services 
(insurance  coverage)  provided  to  the  policyholder  by  each  annual  reporting  period,  excluding  investment 
component (refunds due to termination and maturity) to be paid to the policyholder regardless of the insured 
event. In addition, net insurance income and net investment income are presented separately to enable users 
of the information to understand the sources of net income. 
 
The Group also includes the time value of money, financial risk and effects of their fluctuations related to the 
group of  insurance contracts and the Group should select accounting policy whether the insurance finance 
income or expenses for the periods are divided to profit or loss, or other comprehensive income. 
 
(Accounting policy for transition of insurance contracts) 
 
Under  transition  requirements  of  Korean  IFRS  No.1117,  the  Group  shall  adjust  the  original  cost-based 
measurement  to  current  measurement  by  applying  the  fully  retrospective  approach,  modified  retrospective 
approach or fair value approach, for the group of insurance contracts issued before the transition date (the 
beginning of the annual reporting period immediately preceding initial application date of January 1, 2022). 
 
In principle, the Group shall identify, recognize and measure each group of insurance contracts as if Korean 
IFRS No.1117 had always applied before the transition date. If this method is impracticable, the Group can 
apply the modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach. However, the fair value approach can be 
applied even though it is possible to apply the fully retrospective approach for the group of insurance contracts 
with direct participation features that meet specific requirements. 
 
Meanwhile, the modified retrospective approach is a way to obtain results very close to the fully retrospective 
approach by using all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort. The fair 
value approach is a way to measure group of insurance contracts using fair value measurements based on 
Korean IFRS No.1113 Fair Value Measurements. When applying the fair value approach, contractual service 
margin or loss component of the liability for remaining coverage at the transition date are measured as the 
difference between the fair value of a group of insurance contracts at that date and the fulfilment cash flows 
measured at that date.1213077INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION078INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries

insurance revenue recognition, financial volatility is expected to occur in the consolidated financial statements 
for 2023. 
 
In 2021, the Group carried out continual system conformity verification and stabilization, and preparation for 
dual closing in 2022. Accordingly, in 2021, the preliminary and potential impact of the adoption of Korean IFRS 
No.1117  are  disclosed,  and detailed results  of  financial impact will  be  disclosed in the  annual consolidated 
financial statements for 2022. 
 
The  Group  is  currently  analyzing  the  impact  of  the  measurement  of  insurance  contract  liabilities  after  the 
adoption of Korean IFRS No.1117 due to changes in the insurance liability measurement method and revenue 
recognition method. 
 
As of December 31, 2021, the Group has a total insurance contract liabilities of  ₩ 57,165,936 million, and 
savings type insurance accounts for 28% (₩ 4,467,242 million) of the total insurance premium income. 
 
- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1001 Presentation of Financial Statements – Accounting Policy Disclosure 
 
The amendments require an entity to define and disclose their material accounting policy information. IFRS 
Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements was amended to explain and demonstrate how to apply 
the concept of materiality. The amendments should be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2023, and earlier application is permitted. The Group does not expect that these amendments 
have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.2.1.3 The following new and amended standards have been published that are not mandatory for December

- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1008 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors – 
Definition of Accounting Estimates 
 
The amendments introduce the definition of accounting estimates and clarify how to distinguish changes in 
accounting  estimates  from  changes  in  accounting  policies.  The  amendments  should  be  applied  for  annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and earlier application is permitted. The Group does 
not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
 
- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1012 Income Taxes – Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising 
from a Single Transaction 
 
The amendments narrow the scope of the deferred tax recognition exemption so that it no longer applies to 
transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The 
amendments should be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and earlier 
application is permitted. The Group does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the 
consolidated financial statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 20202.4.4 Net defined benefit liability 
 
The present value of the net defined benefit liability is affected by changes in the various factors determined 
by the actuarial method. 
 
2.4.5 Impairment of goodwill 
 
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are determined based on value-in-use calculations to test 
whether impairment of goodwill has occurred. 
 
2.4.6 Estimated claims for Incurred But Not Reported (“IBNR”) 
 
An  amount  of  IBNR  is  the  total  sum  of  estimated  insurance  claims  that  shall  be  paid  for  accidents  that 
occurred but have not been reported to the Group and estimated insurance claims that shall be additionally 
paid upon resumption of payment claims. The Group calculates IBNR by applying statistical methods in risk 
units prescribed in Detailed Regulations on Supervision of Insurance Business, and records IBNR in reserve 
for outstanding claims of insurance liability. IBNR based on statistical methods requires significant accounting 
estimates in determining the application methodology for each accident year (PLDM, ILDM, BFM, and others) 
and determining the loss development factor. 
 
2.4.7 Assessment of expected credit losses of financial instruments related to COVID-19 
 
The  proliferation  of  COVID-19  in  2021  negatively  affected  the  global  economy,  despite  various  forms  of 
government support policy. Accordingly, the Group was provided with various economic forecasting scenarios 
from KB Research, assuming macroeconomic changes due to the level of COVID-19 pandemic. The Group 
reviewed  the  possibilities  of  each  scenario  comprehensively,  updated  the  forward-looking  information,  and 
reflected its effect on expected credit losses through the statistical method. In addition, for financial assets in 
risky industries vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19, the Group measured expected credit losses using a 
conservative scenario comparing to the forecasted forward-looking information  and reflected credit risk that 
will increase in the future, such as by expanding the scope of loans subject to lifetime expected credit losses 
(non-impaired). The Group will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the expected credit losses by 
comprehensively considering the duration of the impact on the entire economy and the government's policies.2.4 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
The  Group  applies  accounting  policies  and  uses  judgements,  accounting  estimates,  and  assumptions  that 
may have a significant impact on the assets (liabilities) and incomes (expenses) in preparing the consolidated 
financial statements. Management’s estimates of outcomes may differ from actual outcomes if management’s 
estimates and assumptions based on management’s best judgment are different from the actual environment. 
 
Estimates and underlying  assumptions are continually evaluated,  and changes  in accounting estimates are 
recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed and in any future periods affected. 
 
Uncertainties in estimates and assumptions with significant risks that may result in material adjustments to the 
consolidated financial statements are as follows: 
 
2.4.1 Income taxes 
 
As the income taxes on the Group’s taxable income is calculated by applying the tax laws of various countries 
and the decisions of tax authorities, there is uncertainty in calculating the final tax effect. 
 
If  a  certain  portion  of  the  taxable  income  is  not  used  for  investments,  wages,  etc.  in  accordance  with  the 
Korean regulation called ‘Special Taxation for Facilitation of Investment and Mutually-beneficial Cooperation’, 
the  Group  is  liable  to  pay  additional  income  tax  calculated  based  on  the  tax  laws.  Therefore,  the  effect  of 
recirculation  of  corporate  income  should  be  reflected  in  current  and  deferred  income  tax.  As  the  Group’s 
income  tax  is  dependent  on  the  actual  investments,  wages,  etc.  per  each  year,  there  are  uncertainties  in 
measuring the final tax effects during the period when the tax law is applied. 
 
2.4.2 Fair value of financial instruments 
 
The fair value of financial instruments where no active market exists or where quoted prices are not otherwise 
available is determined by using valuation techniques. Financial instruments, which are not actively traded in 
the  market  and  those  with  less  transparent  market  prices,  will  have  less  objective  fair  values  and  require 
broad  judgment  on  liquidity,  concentration,  uncertainty  in  market  factors,  assumptions  in  fair  value 
determination, and other risks. 
 
As  described  in  the  significant  accounting  policies  in  Note  3.3  Recognition  and  Measurement  of  Financial 
Instruments, diverse valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, from 
generally accepted market valuation models to internally developed valuation models that incorporate various 
types of assumptions and variables. 
 
2.4.3 Allowances and provisions for credit losses 
 
The Group recognizes and measures allowances for credit losses of debt instruments measured at amortized 
cost, debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and lease receivables. 
Also, the Group recognizes and measures provisions for credit losses of acceptances and guarantees, and 
unused  loan  commitments.  Accuracy  of  allowances  and  provisions  for  credit  losses  is  dependent  upon 
estimation of expected cash flows of the borrower subject to individual assessment of impairment, and upon 
assumptions and variables of model used in collective assessment of impairment and estimation of provisions 
for credit losses of acceptances and guarantees, and unused loan commitments.1819080INTRODUCTIONCORE COMPETENCYGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries

December 31, 2021 and 20203. Significant Accounting Policies 
 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set 
out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
 
For the comparative purpose, certain information in the notes for the year ended December 31, 2020 have 
been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
3.1 Consolidation 
 
3.1.1 Subsidiaries 
 
Subsidiaries  are  companies  that  are  controlled  by  the  Group.  The  Group  controls  an  investee  when  it  is 
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the investee. Also, the existence and effects of potential voting rights that 
are  currently  exercisable  or  convertible  are  considered  when  assessing  whether  the  Group  controls  the 
investee. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date when control is transferred to the Group and de-
consolidated from the date when control is lost. 
 
If a subsidiary uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for 
like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to that subsidiary’s 
financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity with the Group’s 
accounting policies. 
 
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the parent 
and  to  the  non-controlling  interests,  if  any.  Total  comprehensive  income  is  attributed  to  the  owners  of  the 
parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit 
balance. 
 
Transactions  with  non-controlling  interests  that  do  not  result  in  loss  of  control  are  accounted  for  as  equity 
transactions (i.e., transactions with owners in their capacity as owners). The difference between fair value of 
any  consideration  paid  and  carrying  amount  of  the  subsidiary’s  net  assets  attributable  to  the  additional 
interests  acquired,  is  recorded  in  equity.  Gains  or  losses  on  disposals  to  non-controlling  interests  are  also 
recorded in equity. 
 
When the Group loses control, any investment retained in the former subsidiary is recognized at its fair value 
at the date when control is lost, with the resulting difference recognized in profit or loss. This fair value will be 
the  fair  value  on  initial  recognition  of  a  financial  asset  in  accordance  with  Korean  IFRS  No.1109  or,  when 
appropriate,  the  cost  on  initial  recognition  of  an  investment  in  an  associate  or  joint  venture.  In  addition,  all 
amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for 
on the same basis as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. 
Therefore, amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. 
 
The Group accounts for each business combination  by applying the  acquisition method. The consideration 
transferred is measured at fair value, and identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are initially measured at acquisition-date fair values. For each business 
combination,  the  Group  measures  non-controlling  interests  in  the  acquiree  that  entitle  their  holders  to  a 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets in the event of liquidation at either (a) fair value or (b) the 
proportionate  share  in  the  recognized  amounts  of  the  acquiree’s  identifiable  net  assets. Acquisition-related 
costs are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred.203.1.1 Subsidiaries (cont’d) 
 
In a business combination achieved in stages, the Group shall remeasure its previously held equity interest in 
the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value and recognize the resulting gain or loss, if any, in profit or loss or 
other  comprehensive  income,  as  appropriate.  In  prior  reporting  periods,  the  Group  may  have  recognized 
changes in the value of its equity interest in the acquiree in other comprehensive income. If so, the amount 
that was recognized in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified as profit or loss, or retained earnings, 
on  the  same  basis  as  would  be  required  if  the  Group  had  directly  disposed  of  the  previously  held  equity 
interest. 
 
The Group applies the book-value  method to account for business combinations of entities under common 
control. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their 
book value on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. In addition, the difference between (a) the 
sum  of  consolidated  net  book  value  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  transferred  and  accumulated  other 
comprehensive income and (b) the consideration paid, is recognized as capital surplus. 
 
3.1.2 Associates and joint ventures 
 
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence over the financial and operating policy 
decisions. Generally, if the Group holds 20% or more of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that 
the Group has significant influence. 
 
Joint  ventures  are  investments  in  which  the  Group  has  joint  control  over  economic  activities  pursuant  to 
contractual  arrangement.  Decisions  about  strategic  financial  and  operating  policies  require  unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control. 
 
Investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognized at cost and equity method is applied after 
initial recognition. The carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the Group’s share of the profit 
or loss of the investee and changes in the investee’s equity after the date of acquisition. Distributions received 
from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from 
transactions  between  the  Group  and  associates  are  eliminated  to  the  extent  of  the  Group’s  share  in 
associates.  If  unrealized  losses  are  an  indication  of  an  impairment  that  requires  recognition  in  the 
consolidated financial statements, those losses are recognized for the period. 
 
If associates or joint ventures use accounting policies other than those of the Group for like transactions and 
events  in  similar  circumstances,  if  necessary,  adjustments  shall  be  made  to  make  the  associates  or  joint 
ventures’ accounting policies conform to those of the Group when the associates or joint ventures’ financial 
statements are used by the Group in applying the equity method. 
 
If the Group’s share of losses of associates and joint ventures equals or exceeds its interest in the associates 
(including long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associates), 
the Group discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. After the Group’s interest is reduced to zero, 
additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognized, only to the extent that the Group has incurred 
legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee. 
 
The Group determines at each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the investments 
in  the  associates  are  impaired.  If  this  is  the  case,  the  Group  calculates  the  amount  of  impairment  as  the 
difference  between  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  associates  and  its  carrying  amount  and  recognizes  the 
amount as non-operating expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.21081INTRODUCTIONCORE COMPETENCYGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 20203.1.3 Structured entity 
 
A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant 
factor in deciding who controls the entity. When the Group decides whether it has power over the structured 
entities in which the Group has interests, it considers factors such as the purpose, the form, the substantive 
ability to direct the relevant activities of a structured entity, the nature of its relationship with a structured entity, 
and the amount of exposure to variable returns. 
 
3.1.4 Funds management 
 
The Group manages and operates trust assets, collective investment, and other funds on behalf of investors. 
These trusts and funds are not consolidated, except for trusts and funds over which the Group has control. 
 
3.1.5 Intragroup transactions 
 
Intragroup  balances,  income,  expenses,  and  any  unrealized  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  intragroup 
transactions are eliminated in full, in preparing the consolidated financial statements. If unrealized losses are 
an indication of an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements, those losses 
are recognized for the period. 
 
3.2 Foreign Currency 
 
3.2.1 Foreign currency transactions 
 
A foreign currency transaction is recorded, at initial recognition in the functional currency, by applying to the 
foreign currency amount the spot exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at 
the date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting period, foreign currency monetary items are translated 
using the closing rate which is the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items 
that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date when 
the fair value was measured and non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
 
Except  for  the  exchange  differences  for  the  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation  and  the  financial  liability 
designated  as  a  hedging  instrument  of  net  investment,  exchange  differences  arising  on  the  settlement  of 
monetary  items  or  on  translating  monetary  items are recognized in profit or loss. When a gain or loss on a 
non-monetary item is recognized in other comprehensive income, any exchange component of that gain or 
loss is recognized in other comprehensive income, conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is 
recognized in profit or loss, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. 
 
3.2.2 Foreign operations 
 
The results and financial position of a foreign operation, whose functional currency differs from the Group’s 
presentation  currency,  are  translated  into  the  Group’s  presentation  currency  based  on  the  following 
procedures. 
 
If the functional currency of a foreign operation is not the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, assets and 
liabilities  for  each  statement  of  financial  position  presented  (including  comparatives)  are  translated  at  the 
closing rate at the end of the reporting period, income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive 
income presented (including comparatives) are translated using the average exchange rates for the period. All 
resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.223.2.2 Foreign operations (cont’d) 
 
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition of that foreign operation are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign operation. Thus, they are expressed in the functional currency of the foreign operation 
and are translated into the presentation currency at the closing rate. 
 
On  the  disposal  of  a  foreign  operation,  the  cumulative  amount  of  the  exchange  differences  relating  to  that 
foreign operation, recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the separate component of 
equity, is reclassified from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification adjustment) when the gain or loss on 
disposal is recognized. On the partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the Group re-
attributes the proportionate share of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognized in other 
comprehensive income to the non-controlling interests in that foreign operation. In any other partial disposal of 
a  foreign  operation,  the  Group  reclassifies  to  profit  or  loss  only  the  proportionate  share  of  the  cumulative 
amount of the exchange differences recognized in other comprehensive income. 
 
3.2.3 Translation of the net investment in a foreign operation 
 
A  monetary  item  that  is  receivable  from  or  payable  to  a  foreign  operation,  for  which  settlement  is  neither 
planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future is, in substance, a part of the Group’s net investment in 
that foreign operation, then foreign currency difference arising from that monetary item is recognized in the 
other comprehensive income and shall be reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. 
 
3.3 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments 
 
3.3.1 Initial recognition 
 
The Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability in its consolidated statement of financial position 
when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A regular way purchase or sale 
of financial assets (a purchase or sale of a financial asset under a contract whose terms require delivery of the 
asset within the time frame established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned) is 
recognized and derecognized using trade date accounting. 
 
For  financial  reporting  purpose,  the  Group  classifies  (a)  financial  assets  as  financial  assets  at  fair  value 
through profit or loss, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, or financial assets at 
amortized  cost  and  (b)  financial  liabilities  as  financial  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  or  other 
financial liabilities. These classifications are based on the business model for managing financial instruments 
and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial instrument at initial recognition. 
 
At initial recognition, a financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the 
case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are 
directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition  or  issue  of  the  financial  asset  or  financial  liability.  The  fair  value  is 
defined  as  the  price  that  would  be  received  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly 
transaction  between  market  participants.  The  fair  value  of  a  financial  instrument  on  initial  recognition  is 
normally the transaction price (that is, the fair value of the consideration given or received) in an arm’s length 
transaction. 
 
3.3.2 Subsequent measurement 
 
After  initial  recognition,  financial  instruments  are  measured  at  amortized  cost  or  fair  value  based  on 
classification at initial recognition.23082INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 20203.3.2.1 Amortized cost 
 
The  amortized  cost  of  a  financial  asset  or  financial  liability  is  the  amount  at  which  the  financial  asset  or 
financial  liability  is  measured  at  initial  recognition  minus  the  principal  repayments,  plus  or  minus  the 
cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and 
the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance. 
 
3.3.2.2 Fair value 
 
The  Group  uses  quoted  price  in  an  active  market  which  is  based  on  listed  market  price  or  dealer  price 
quotations  of  financial  instruments  traded  in  an  active  market  as  best  estimate  of  fair  value.  A  financial 
instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from 
an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent 
actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. 
 
If  there  is  no  active  market  for  a  financial  instrument,  fair  value  is  determined  either  by  using  a  valuation 
technique or independent third-party valuation service. Valuation techniques include using recent arm's length 
market transactions between knowledgeable and willing parties, if available, referencing the current fair value 
of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, and option pricing models. 
 
The  Group  uses  valuation  models  that  are  commonly  used  by  market  participants  and  customized  for  the 
Group to determine fair values of common over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives such as options, interest rate 
swaps,  and  currency  swaps  which  are  based  on  the  inputs  observable  in  markets.  However,  for  some 
complex financial instruments that require fair value measurement by valuation techniques based on certain 
assumptions because some or all inputs used in the model are not observable in the market, the Group uses 
internal  valuation  models  developed  from  general  valuation  models  or  valuation  results  from  independent 
external valuation institutions. 
 
In addition, the fair value information recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position is classified 
into the following fair value hierarchy, reflecting the significance of the input variables used in the fair value 
measurement. 
 
  Level 1 : Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group canLevel 2 : Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,access at the measurement dateeither directly or indirectlyLevel 3 : Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
 
The fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the 
lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. For this purpose, the significance of an input is 
assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety. 
 
If  a  fair  value  measurement  uses  observable  inputs  that  require  significant  adjustment  using  unobservable 
inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement. 
 
If the valuation technique does not reflect all factors which market participants would consider in pricing the 
asset or liability, the fair value is adjusted to reflect those factors. Those factors include counterparty credit risk, 
bid-ask spread, liquidity risk, and others.3.3.2.2 Fair value (cont’d) 
 
The  Group  uses  valuation  technique  which  maximizes  the  use  of  market  inputs  and  minimizes  the  use  of 
entity-specific inputs. It incorporates all factors that market participants would consider in pricing the asset or 
liability and is consistent with economic methodologies applied for pricing financial instruments. Periodically, 
the Group calibrates the valuation technique and tests its validity using prices of observable current market 
transactions of the same instrument or based on other relevant observable market data. 
 
3.3.3 Derecognition 
 
Derecognition  is  the  removal  of  a  previously  recognized  financial  asset  or  financial  liability  from  the 
consolidated  statement  of  financial  position.  The  derecognition  criteria  for  financial  assets  and  financial 
liabilities are as follows: 
 
3.3.3.1 Derecognition of financial assets 
 
A financial asset is derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire 
or the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, or the Group 
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset and the 
Group  has  not  retained  control.  Therefore,  if  the  Group  does  not  transfer  substantially  all  the  risks  and 
rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the financial asset to the extent 
of its continuing involvement in the financial asset. 
 
If  the  Group  transfers  the  contractual  rights  to  receive  the  cash  flows  of  the  financial  asset  but  retains 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the Group continues to recognize 
the transferred asset in its entirety and recognize a financial liability for the consideration received. 
 
The  Group  writes  off  a  financial  asset  when  the  Group  has  no  reasonable  expectations  of  recovering  a 
financial  asset  in  its  entirety  or  a  portion  thereof.  In  general,  the  Group  considers  write-off  when  it  is 
determined that the debtor does not have sufficient funds or income to cover the principal and interest. The 
write-off decision is made in accordance with internal regulations. After the write-off, the Group can continue 
to  collect  the  written-off  loans  according  to  the  internal  policy.  Recovered  amounts  from  financial  assets 
previously written-off are recognized in profit or loss. 
 
3.3.3.2 Derecognition of financial liabilities 
 
A  financial  liability  is  derecognized  from  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position  when  it  is 
extinguished (i.e., the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, canceled or expires). 
 
3.3.4 Offsetting 
 
A  financial  asset  and  a  financial  liability  are  offset,  and  the  net  amount  is  presented  in  the  consolidated 
statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set 
off the recognized amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on a future event and must be 
legally  enforceable  in  the  normal  course  of  business,  the  event  of  default,  and  the  event  of  insolvency  or 
bankruptcy of the Group and all of the counterparties.2425083INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries

December 31, 2021 and 20203.4 Cash and Due from Financial Institutions 
 
Cash and due from financial institutions include cash on hand, foreign currency, and short-term, highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant 
risk  of  changes  in  value,  and  due  from  financial  institutions.  Cash  and  due  from  financial  institutions  are 
measured at amortized cost. 
 
3.5 Non-derivative Financial Assets 
 
3.5.1 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
 
Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss unless they are classified 
as financial assets at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. 
 
The Group may designate certain financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss 
when  the  designation  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  a  measurement  or  recognition  inconsistency 
(sometimes  referred  to  as  an  ‘accounting  mismatch’)  that  would  otherwise  arise  from  measuring  assets  or 
liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on different bases. 
 
After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is measured at fair value and gains 
or losses arising from a change in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. Interest income using the effective 
interest  method  and  dividend  income  from  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  also 
recognized in profit or loss. 
 
3.5.2 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 
 
The  Group  classifies  below  financial  assets  as  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive 
income:-  Debt  instruments  that  are  held  within  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  achieved  by  both 
collecting  contractual  cash  flows  and  selling  financial  assets,  and  where  the  assets’  cash  flows 
represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and;-  Equity  instruments  that  are  not  held  for  short-term  trading  but  held  for  strategic  investment,  anddesignated as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive incomeAfter initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income is measured at fair 
value.  Gains  or  losses  arising  from  a  change  in  fair  value,  other  than  dividend  income,  interest  income 
calculated using the effective interest method and exchange differences arising on monetary items which are 
recognized directly in profit or loss, are recognized in other comprehensive income in equity. 
 
When the financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is disposed of, the cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss. 
However, cumulative gain or loss of equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive 
income is reclassified to retained earnings not to profit or loss at disposal. 
 
A  financial  asset  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  denominated  in  foreign  currency  is 
translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences resulting from changes in amortized cost are recognized 
in profit or loss, and other changes are recognized in equity.3.5.3 Financial assets at amortized cost 
 
A  financial  asset,  which  is  held  within  the  business  model  whose  objective  is  achieved  by  collecting 
contractual cash flows, and where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding, is classified as a financial asset at amortized cost. After initial recognition, 
a  financial  asset  at  amortized  cost  is  measured  at  amortized  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method  and 
interest income is calculated using the effective interest method. 
 
3.6 Expected Credit Losses of Financial Assets (Debt Instruments) 
 
The  Group  recognizes  loss  allowances  for  expected  credit  losses  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  for 
financial  assets  at  amortized  cost  and  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  except  for  financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
Expected credit losses are estimated at present value of probability-weighted amount that is determined by 
evaluating  a  range  of  possible  outcomes.  The  Group  measures  expected  credit  losses  by  reflecting  all 
reasonable  and  supportable  information  that  is  available  without  undue  cost  or  effort  at  the  reporting  date 
about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions. 
 
The approaches of measuring expected credit losses in accordance with Korean IFRS are as follows:-  General  approach:  for  financial  assets  and  unused  loan  commitments  not  subject  to  the  below  2approaches-  Simplified approach: for trade receivables, contract assets, and lease receivables 
-  Credit-impaired approach: for financial assets that are credit-impaired at the time of acquisitionApplication of general approach is differentiated depending on whether credit risk has increased significantly 
after initial recognition. If the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial 
recognition, the Group measures loss allowances for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month 
expected  credit  losses, whereas if the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since 
initial recognition, the Group measures loss allowances for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the 
lifetime expected credit losses. Lifetime is the period until the contractual maturity date of financial instruments 
and means the expected life. 
 
The Group assesses whether the credit risk has increased significantly using the following criteria, and if one 
or more of the following criteria are met, it is deemed as significant increase in credit risk. Criterion of more 
than  30  days  past  due  is  applied  to  all  subsidiaries,  and  other  criteria  are  applied  selectively  considering 
specific indicators of each subsidiary or additionally considering specific indicators of each subsidiary. If the 
contractual cash flows of a financial asset have been renegotiated or modified, the Group assesses whether 
the credit risk has increased significantly using the same following criteria.-  More than 30 days past due 
-  Decline in credit rating at the end of the reporting period by certain notches or more compared to thetime of initial recognition-  Subsequent managing ratings below certain level in the early warning system 
-  Debt restructuring (except for impaired financial assets) and 
-  Credit delinquency information of Korea Federation of Banks, etc.2627084INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 20203.6 Expected Credit Losses of Financial Assets (Debt Instruments) (cont’d) 
 
Under  simplified  approach,  the  Group  always  measures  loss  allowances  at  an  amount  equal  to  lifetime 
expected credit losses. Under credit-impaired approach, the Group only recognizes the cumulative changes in 
lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition as loss allowances at the end of the reporting period. In 
assessing  credit  impairment,  the  Group  uses  definition  of  default  as  in  the  new  Basel  Accord  which  rules 
calculation of Capital Adequacy Ratio. 
 
The Group generally considers the loan to be credit-impaired if one or more of the following criteria are met:90 days or more past due 
Legal proceedings related to collection- 
- 
-  A borrower registered on the credit management list of Korea Federation of Banks 
-  A corporate borrower with the credit rating C and D 
-  Refinancing and 
-  Debt restructuring, etc.3.6.1 Forward-looking information 
 
The Group uses forward-looking information, when determining whether credit risk has increased significantly 
and measuring expected credit losses. 
 
The Group assumes that the risk components have a constant correlation with the economic cycle and uses 
statistical methodologies to estimate the relation between key macroeconomic variables and risk components 
for the expected credit losses. 
 
The correlation between the major macroeconomic variables and the credit risk are as follows:Correlation between the major macroeconomicvariables and the credit riskKey macroeconomic variablesDomestic GDP growth rate 
 
Composite stock index 
 
Rate of change of construction investment 
 
Rate of change of housing transaction price index

forecasts  utilized  by  management  of  the  Group  for  its  business  plan  considering  reliable  external  agency’s 
forecasts  and  others.  The  forward-looking  information  is  generated  by  KB  Research  with  a  comprehensive 
approach to capture the possibility of various economic forecast scenarios that are derived from the internal 
and external viewpoints of the macroeconomic situation. The Group determines the macroeconomic variables 
to be used in forecasting future conditions of the economy, considering the direction of the forecast scenario 
and the significant relationship between macroeconomic variables and time series data. And there are some 
changes compared to the macroeconomic variables used in the previous year. 
 
In order to reflect additional credit risk for financial assets whose industries are highly affected by COVID-19, 
the  Group  measures  expected  credit  losses  using  a  conservative  scenario  compared  to  the  forecasted 
forward-looking information.3.6.2 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at amortized cost 
 
The  expected  credit  losses  of  financial  assets  at  amortized  cost  are  measured  as  present  value  of  the 
difference between the contractual cash flows to be received and the cash flows expected to be received. The 
Group estimates expected future cash flows for financial assets that are  individually significant. The Group 
selects the individually significant financial assets by comprehensively considering quantitative and qualitative 
factors (such as debt restructuring or negative net assets, etc.) among financial assets with the credit risk has 
increased significantly or credit-impaired (individual assessment of impairment). 
 
For financial assets that are not individually significant, the Group collectively estimates expected credit losses 
by grouping loans with a homogeneous credit risk profile (collective assessment of impairment). 
 
3.6.2.1 Individual assessment of impairment 
 
Individual assessment of impairment losses is performed using management's best estimate on the present 
value of expected future cash flows. The Group uses all the available information including financial condition 
of the borrower such as operating cash flow and net realizable value of any collateral held. 
 
3.6.2.2 Collective assessment of impairment 
 
Collective  assessment  of  impairment  losses  is  performed  by  using  a  methodology  based  on  historical  loss 
experience and reflecting forward-looking information. Such a  process incorporates factors such  as type  of 
collateral, type of product, type of borrower, credit rating, size of portfolio, and recovery period and applies 
Probability of Default (“PD”) on a group of assets and Loss Given Default (“LGD”) by type of recovery method. 
Also, the Group applies certain assumptions to model expected credit losses assessment and to determine 
input  based  on  loss  experience  and  forward-looking  information.  These  models  and  assumptions  are 
periodically reviewed to reduce the gap between loss estimate and actual loss experience. 
 
The lifetime expected credit losses are measured by applying the PD to the carrying amount calculated by 
deducting the expected principal repayment amount from the carrying amount as of the reporting date and the 
LGD adjusted to reflect changes in the carrying amount. 
 
3.6.3 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 
 
The Group  measures expected credit losses on financial assets  at fair value through other comprehensive 
income  in  a  manner  that  is  consistent  with  the  requirements  that  are  applicable  to  financial  assets  at 
amortized cost. However, loss allowances are recognized in other comprehensive income. Upon disposal or 
repayment  of  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income,  the  amount  of  loss 
allowances is reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss.2829085INTRODUCTIONCORE COMPETENCYGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 20203.7 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
The Group enters into numerous derivative financial instrument contracts such as currency forwards, interest 
rate swaps, currency swaps, and others for trading purposes or to manage its interest rate risk, currency risk, 
and  others.  The  Group’s  derivative  financial  instruments  business  focuses  on  addressing  the  needs  of  the 
Group’s corporate clients to hedge their risk exposure and to hedge the Group’s risk exposure that results 
from  such  client  contracts.  These  derivative  financial  instruments  are  presented  as  derivative  financial 
instruments  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  irrespective  of  transaction  purpose  and  subsequent 
measurement requirement. 
 
The  Group  designates  certain  derivative  financial  instruments  as  hedging  instruments  to  hedge  the  risk  of 
changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge) 
and the risk of changes in cash flow  (cash  flow  hedge). The Group designates certain derivative and non-
derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments to hedge the currency risk of the net investment in a 
foreign operation (hedge of net investment). 
 
At  the  inception  of  the  hedging  relationship,  there  is  formal  designation  and  documentation  of  the  hedging 
relationship  and  the  Group's  risk  management  objective  and  strategy  for  undertaking  the  hedge.  This 
documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being 
hedged, the inception date of hedging relationship and how the Group will assess the hedging instrument's 
effectiveness in offsetting the changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged 
risk. 
 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value. After initial recognition, derivative financial 
instruments are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described below. 
 
3.7.1 Derivative financial instruments held for trading 
 
All derivative financial instruments, except for derivatives that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, 
are measured at fair value. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss 
as part of net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
3.7.2 Derivative financial instruments for fair value hedges 
 
If derivative financial instruments are designated and qualify for fair value hedges, changes in fair value of the 
hedging  instrument  and  changes  in  fair  value  of  the  hedged  item  attributable  to  the  hedged  risk  are 
recognized  in  profit  or  loss  as  part  of  other  operating  income  or  expenses.  If  the  hedged  items  are  equity 
instruments for which the Group has elected to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income, 
changes in fair value of the hedging instrument and changes in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the 
hedged risk are recognized in other comprehensive income. 
 
Fair  value  hedge  accounting  is  discontinued  prospectively  if  the  hedging  instrument  expires  or  is  sold, 
terminated  or  exercised,  or  the  hedging  relationship  ceases  to  meet  the  qualifying  criteria.  Once  fair  value 
hedge accounting  is discontinued, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a  hedged  item  is amortized to 
profit or loss by the maturity of the financial instrument using the effective interest method.303.7.3 Derivative financial instruments for cash flow hedges 
 
The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify 
for cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income, limited to the cumulative change in fair 
value (present value) of the hedged item (the present value of the cumulative change in the hedged expected 
future cash flows) from inception of the hedge. The ineffective portion is recognized in profit or loss as other 
operating  income  or  expenses.  The  associated  gains  or  losses  that  were  previously  recognized  in  other 
comprehensive income are reclassified from equity to profit or loss (other operating income or expenses) as a 
reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast cash flows affect 
profit or loss. Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if the hedging instrument expires or is 
sold,  terminated  or  exercised,  or  the  hedging  relationship  ceases  to  meet  the  qualifying  criteria.  When  the 
cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, the cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument that 
have been recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss over the period in which 
the forecast transaction occurs. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains 
or losses that have been recognized in other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified to profit or 
loss. 
 
3.7.4 Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments designated for net investments hedges 
 
If derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are designated and qualify for the net investment hedge, 
the effective portion of changes in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in other comprehensive 
income and the ineffective portion is recognized in profit or loss as other operating income or expenses. The 
cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge that have 
been accumulated in other comprehensive income will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to 
profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation. 
 
3.7.5 Embedded derivatives 
 
An embedded derivative is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative if, and only if, 
(a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the 
host  contract,  (b)  a  separate  instrument  with  the  same  terms  as  the  embedded  derivative  would  meet  the 
definition of a  derivative  and (c) the hybrid contract  contains a  host that is not a financial asset and  is not 
designated as at fair value through profit or loss. Gains or losses arising from a change in fair value of an 
embedded derivative separated from the host contract are recognized in profit or loss as part of net gains or 
losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
3.7.6 Day one gains or losses 
 
If the Group uses a valuation technique that incorporates unobservable inputs for the fair value of the OTC 
derivatives  at  initial  recognition,  there  may  be  a  difference  between  the  transaction  price  and  the  amount 
determined using that valuation technique. In these circumstances, the difference is not recognized in profit or 
loss but deferred and amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the financial instrument. If the 
fair value is subsequently determined using observable inputs, the remaining deferred amount is recognized in 
profit or loss as part of net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss or other 
operating income or expenses.31086INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries

December 31, 2021 and 20203.8 Property and Equipment 
 
3.8.1 Recognition and measurement 
 
Property  and  equipment  that  qualify  for  recognition  as  an  asset  are  measured  at  cost  and  subsequently 
carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
 
The cost of property and equipment includes any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location 
and condition necessary for it to  be capable  of  operating  in the  manner intended  by management and the 
initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located. 
 
Subsequent  expenditures  are  capitalized  only  when  they  prolong  the  useful  life  or  enhance  values  of  the 
assets  but  the  costs  of  the  day-to-day  servicing  of  the  assets  such  as  repair  and  maintenance  costs  are 
recognized  in  profit  or  loss  as  incurred.  When  part  of  an  item  of  property  and  equipment  has  a  useful  life 
different from that of the entire asset, it is recognized as a separate asset. 
 
3.8.2 Depreciation 
 
Land is not depreciated, whereas other property and equipment are depreciated using the method that reflects 
the pattern in which the asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group. The 
depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value. 
 
Each part of an item of property and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the 
item is depreciated separately. 
 
The depreciation method and estimated useful life of property and equipment are as follows:Property and equipmentBuildingsLeasehold improvements

change in an accounting estimate.3.9 Investment Properties 
 
3.9.1 Recognition and measurement 
 
Properties  held  to  earn  rentals  or  for  capital  appreciation  or  both  are  classified  as  investment  properties. 
Investment properties are measured initially at their cost and subsequently the cost model is used. 
 
3.9.2 Depreciation 
 
Land is not depreciated, whereas other investment properties are depreciated using the method that reflects 
the pattern in which the asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group. The 
depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value. 
 
The depreciation method and estimated useful life of investment properties are as follows:Investment propertiesBuildingsDepreciation methodStraight-lineEstimated useful life20~40 yearsThe  residual  value,  the  useful  life,  and  the  depreciation  method  applied  to  an  asset  are  reviewed  at  each

change in an accounting estimate. 
 
3.10 Intangible Assets 
 
Intangible assets are measured initially at cost and subsequently carried at their cost less any accumulated 
amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. 
 
Intangible  assets,  except  for  goodwill  and  membership  rights,  are  amortized  using  the  straight-line  or 
declining-balance method with no residual value over their estimated useful life since the assets are available 
for use.Intangible assetsIndustrial property rightsSoftwareValue of business acquiredOthersAmortization methodStraight-line / Declining-balanceStraight-line

useful life is indefinite, the Group carries out a review in each accounting period to confirm whether events 
and circumstances still support an indefinite useful life assessment. If they do not, the change in the useful life 
assessment from indefinite to finite is accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3233087INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION088INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION089INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION090INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries

December 31, 2021 and 20203.18 Revenue Recognition 
 
The Group recognizes revenues in accordance with the following steps determined in accordance with Korean 
IFRS No.1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.-  Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer. 
-  Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 
-  Step 3: Determine the transaction price. 
-  Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 
-  Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.3.18.1 Interest income and expense 
 
Interest  income  and  expense  on  debt  securities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  (excluding  beneficiary 
certificates, equity  investments, and other debt  instruments), loans, financial  instruments at amortized cost, 
and  debt  securities  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  are  recognized  in  the  consolidated 
statement  of  comprehensive  income  using  the  effective  interest  method  in  accordance  with  Korean  IFRS 
No.1109 Financial Instruments. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of 
a financial asset or a financial liability and allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant 
period. 
 
The  effective  interest  rate  is  the  rate  that  exactly  discounts  estimated  future  cash  receipts  or  payments 
through  the  expected  life  of  the  financial  instrument  or,  where  appropriate,  a  shorter  period,  to  the  gross 
carrying  amount  of  a  financial  asset  or  to  the  amortized  cost  of  a  financial  liability.  When  calculating  the 
effective  interest rate, the Group estimates expected cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the 
financial instrument but does not consider expected credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points 
paid (main components of effective interest rate only) or received between parties to the contract that are an 
integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts. In those rare 
cases when it is not possible to reliably estimate the cash flows and the expected life of a financial instrument, 
the Group uses the contractual cash flows over the full contractual term of the financial instrument. 
 
Interest  income  on  impaired  financial  assets  is  recognized  using  the  interest  rate  used  to  discount  the 
expected cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. 
 
Interest income on debt securities at fair value through profit or loss is also classified as interest income in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
 
3.18.2 Fee and commission income 
 
The  Group  recognizes  financial  service  fees  in  accordance  with  the  purpose  of  charging  the  fees  and  the 
accounting standards of the financial instrument related to the fees earned. 
 
3.18.2.1 Fees that are an integral part of the effective interest of a financial instrument 
 
Such fees are generally treated as adjustments of effective interest rate. Such fees may include compensation 
for  activities  such  as  evaluating  the  borrower's  financial  condition,  evaluating  and  recording  guarantees, 
collateral and other security arrangements, negotiating the terms of the instrument, preparing and processing 
documents,  and  closing  the  transaction  and  origination  fees  received  on  issuing  financial  liabilities  at 
amortized  cost.  However,  fees  relating  to  the  creation  or  acquisition  of  a  financial  instrument  at  fair  value 
through profit or loss are recognized as revenue immediately.3.18.2.2 Fees related to performance obligations satisfied over time 
 
If  the  control  of  a  good  or  service  is  transferred  over  time,  the  Group  recognizes  revenue  related  to 
performance obligations over the period of performance obligations. Fees charged in return for the services 
for a certain period of time, such as asset management fees, consignment business fees, etc. are recognized 
over the period of performance obligations. 
 
3.18.2.3 Fees related to performance obligations satisfied at a point in time 
 
Fees earned at a point in time are recognized as revenue when a customer obtains controls of a promised 
good or service and the Group satisfies a performance obligation. 
 
Commission on negotiation or participation in negotiation for the third party such as trading stocks or other 
securities, arranging merger and acquisition of business, is recognized as revenue when the transaction has 
been completed. 
 
If the Group arranges a syndicated loan but does not participate in the syndicated loan or participates in the 
syndicated  loan  with  the  same  effective  profit  as  other  participants,  a  syndication  arrangement  fee  is 
recognized as revenue at the completion of the syndication service. 
 
3.18.3 Net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss 
 
Net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (including changes in fair value, 
dividends,  and  gains  or  losses  from  foreign  currency  translation)  include  gains  or  losses  on  financial 
instruments as follows:-  Gains or losses relating to financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (excluding interestincome using the effective interest rate method)-  Gains or  losses relating to derivative  financial  instruments for trading (including derivative financialinstruments for hedging purpose but do not qualify for hedge accounting)3.18.4 Dividend income 
 
Dividend  income  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  when  the  right  to  receive  payment  is  established.  Dividend 
income is recognized as net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss or other 
operating income depending on the classification of equity securities.4041091INTRODUCTIONCORE COMPETENCYGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries

December 31, 2021 and 20203.19 Employee Compensation and Benefits 
 
3.19.1 Post-employment benefits 
 
3.19.1.1 Defined contribution plans 
 
When an employee has rendered service to the Group during a period, the Group recognizes the contribution 
payable to a defined contribution plan in exchange for that service as post-employment benefits for the period. 
 
3.19.1.2 Defined benefit plans 
 
All post-employment benefits, other than defined contribution  plans, are classified as defined benefit plans. 
The amount recognized as a net defined benefit liability is the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
less the fair value of plan assets at the end of the reporting period. 
 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The rate used to discount post-employment benefit obligations is determined by 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. The currency 
and term of the corporate bonds are consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment 
benefit obligations. Actuarial gains and losses resulted from changes in actuarial assumptions and experience 
adjustments are recognized in other comprehensive income. 
 
When the present value of the defined benefit obligation minus the fair value of plan assets results in an asset, 
it is recognized to the extent of the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds 
from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. 
 
Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in 
prior periods, resulting from the introduction or changes to a defined benefit plan. Such past service cost is 
immediately recognized as an expense for the period. 
 
3.19.2 Short-term employee benefits 
 
Short-term  employee  benefits  are  employee  benefits  that  are  expected  to  be  settled  wholly  before  twelve 
months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the related service. When 
an  employee  has  rendered  service  to  the  Group  during  an  accounting  period,  the  Group  recognizes  the 
undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service as an 
expense for the period. 
 
The expected cost  of profit-sharing  and bonus payments is recognized as  liabilities when the Group has a 
present legal or constructive obligation to make payments as a result of past events, such as service rendered 
by employees, and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. 
 
3.19.3 Share-based payment 
 
The  Group  provides  its  executives  and  employees  with  stock  grants,  mileage  stock,  and  long-term  share-
based payments programs. When stock grants are exercised, the Group can either select to distribute newly 
issued shares or treasury shares or compensate in cash based on the share price. When mileage stock and 
long-term share-based payments are exercised, the Group pays the amount equivalent to share price of KB 
Financial Group Inc. in cash.423.19.3 Share-based payment (cont’d) 
 
For  a  share-based  payment  transaction  in  which  the  terms  of  the  arrangement  provide  the  Group  with  the 
choice of whether to settle in cash or by issuing equity instruments, the Group accounts for the transaction in 
accordance  with  the  requirements  applying  to  cash-settled  share-based  payment  transactions  because  the 
Group determines that it has a present obligation to settle in cash based on a past practice and a stated policy 
of  settling  in  cash.  Therefore,  the  Group  measures  the  liability  incurred  as  consideration  for  the  service 
received  at  fair  value  and  recognizes  related  expense  and  accrued  expense  over  the  vesting  periods.  For 
mileage  stock  and  long-term  share-based  payments  program,  the  Group  accounts  for  the  transaction  in 
accordance  with  the  requirements  applying  to  cash-settled  share-based  payment  transactions,  which  are 
recognized as expense and accrued expenses at the time of vesting. 
 
Until the liability is settled, the Group remeasures the fair value  of the liability  at the  end  of each reporting 
period and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss as share-based 
payments. 
 
3.19.4 Termination benefits 
 
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement 
date, or an employee’s decision to accept an offer of benefits in exchange for the termination of employment. 
The  Group  recognizes  a  liability  and  expense  for  termination  benefits  at  the  earlier  of  the  following  dates; 
when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group recognizes costs for a 
restructuring  that  is  within  the  scope  of  Korean  IFRS  No.1037  and  involves  the  payment  of  termination 
benefits. If the termination benefits are not expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of 
the annual reporting period, then the termination benefits are discounted to present value. 
 
3.20 Income Tax Expense 
 
Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and deferred income tax expense. Current and deferred 
income tax are recognized as income or expense and included in profit or loss for the period, except to the 
extent that the tax arises from (a) a transaction or event which is recognized, in the same or a different period, 
outside  profit  or  loss,  either  in  other  comprehensive  income  or  directly  in  equity  and  (b)  a  business 
combination. 
 
3.20.1 Current income tax 
 
Current income tax is the amount of income tax payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) 
for a period. A difference between the taxable profit and accounting profit may arise when income or expense 
is included in accounting profit in one period but is included in taxable profit in a different period. Differences 
may also arise if there is revenue that is exempt from taxation, or expense that is not deductible in determining 
taxable profit (loss). Current income tax liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured using the tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. 
 
The Group offsets current income tax assets and current income tax liabilities if, and only if, the Group (a) has 
a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and (b) intends either to settle on a net basis, or 
to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.43092INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 2020CORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 20203.20.2 Deferred income tax 
 
Deferred income tax is recognized, using the asset-liability method, on temporary differences arising between 
the tax-based amount of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the financial statements. Deferred 
income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred income tax assets are 
recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available  against  which  the  deductible  temporary  difference  can  be  utilized.  However,  deferred  income  tax 
liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination, and at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss. 
 
The  Group  recognizes  a  deferred  income  tax  liability  for  all  taxable  temporary  differences  associated  with 
investments  in  subsidiaries,  associates,  and  joint  ventures,  except  to  the  extent  that  the  Group  is  able  to 
control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference, and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 
The  carrying  amount  of  a  deferred  income  tax  asset  is  reviewed  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period.  The 
Group reduces the carrying amount of a deferred income tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred income tax asset 
to be utilized. 
 
Deferred  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  measured  at  the  tax  rates  that  are  expected  to  apply  to  the 
period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred income tax 
liabilities and deferred income tax assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in 
which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its 
assets and liabilities. 
 
The Group offsets deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities if, and only if the Group has a 
legally  enforceable  right  to  set  off  current  income  tax  assets  against  current  income  tax  liabilities  and  the 
deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle 
current  income  tax  liabilities  and  assets  on  a  net  basis,  or  to  realize  the  assets  and  settle  the  liabilities 
simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred income tax liabilities or assets 
are expected to be settled or recovered. 
 
3.20.3 Uncertain tax positions 
 
Uncertain tax positions arise from tax treatments applied by the Group which may be challenged by the tax 
authorities due to the complexity of the transaction or different interpretation of the tax laws, such as a claim 
for rectification, a claim for a refund related to additional tax or a tax investigation by the tax authorities. The 
Group  recognizes  its  uncertain  tax  positions  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with 
Korean IFRS No.1012 and Interpretation of Korean IFRS No.2123. The income tax asset is recognized if a tax 
refund  is  probable  for  taxes  levied  by  the  tax  authority,  and  the  amount  to  be  paid  as  a  result  of  the  tax 
investigation and others is recognized as the current tax payable. However, penalty tax and additional refund 
on tax are regarded as penalty or interest and are accounted for in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1037.3.21 Earnings per Share 
 
The Group calculates basic earnings per share amounts and diluted earnings per share amounts for profit or 
loss  attributable  to  ordinary  equity  holders  of  the  Parent  Company  and  presents  them  in  the  consolidated 
statement  of  comprehensive  income.  Basic  earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  dividing  profit  or  loss 
attributable to ordinary equity holders of the  Parent Company by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the profit or loss 
attributable  to  ordinary  equity  holders  of  the  Parent  Company  and  weighted  average  number  of  shares 
outstanding, taking into account all potential dilution effects, such as exchangeable bonds and share-based 
payments given to employees. 
 
3.22 Lease 
 
The Group as a lessor recognizes lease payments from operating leases as income on a straight-line basis 
over  the  lease  term.  Initial  direct  costs  incurred  in  obtaining  an  operating  lease  are  added  to  the  carrying 
amount of the underlying asset and recognized as expense over the lease term on the same basis as lease 
income. The respective leased assets are included in the consolidated statement of financial position based 
on their nature. 
 
A lessee is required to recognize a right-of-use asset (lease assets) representing its right to use the underlying 
leased  asset  and  a  lease  liability  representing  its  obligation  to  make  lease  payments.  Assets  and  liabilities 
arising from a lease are initially measured at the present value. 
 
Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:- 
- 
- 
--Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable 
Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate 
Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees 
The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, 
and 
Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an 
option to terminate the leaseThe  lease  payments  are  discounted  using  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease  if  that  rate  can  be  readily 
determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, which is 
the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, 
the  funds  necessary  to  obtain  an  asset  of  a  similar  value  to  the  right-of-use  asset  in  a  similar  economic 
environment. 
 
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:- 
- 
- 
-The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability 
Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received 
Any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee, and 
An estimate of restoration costsHowever,  the  Group  can  elect  not  to  apply  the  requirements  of  Korean  IFRS  No.1116  to  short-term  lease 
(lease  that,  at  the  commencement  date,  has  a  lease  term  of  12  months  or  less)  and  leases  for  which  the 
underlying asset is of low value (for example, underlying leased asset under USD 5,000).4445093INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION094INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION095MD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries

  ₩₩1 Financial liabilities measured or designated at fair value through profit or loss and derivatives held for trading are not managed by contractual maturity because they are expected to be 
traded or redeemed before maturity. Therefore, the carrying amounts of those financial instruments are included in the ‘On demand’ category. 
2 Cash flows of derivatives held for hedging are shown at net amount of cash inflows and outflows by remaining contractual maturity. 
3 Deposits that are contractually repayable on demand or on short notice are included in the ‘On demand’ category. 
4 Commitments are included in the ‘On demand’ category because payments can be requested at any time. 
5 Cash flows under financial guarantee contracts are classified based on the earliest period that the contract can be executed.63102INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries

and 2020, are as follows: (cont’d) 
 
Methods of determining fair value of financial instruments are as follows: 
 
Cash and due 
from financial 
institutionsFair value of cash is same as carrying amount. Carrying amount of demand deposit and 
settlement  deposit  is  a  reasonable  approximation  of  fair  value  because  these  financial 
instruments  do  not  have  a  fixed  maturity  and  are  receivable  on  demand.  Fair  value  of 
general deposit is measured using Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) Model. 
 
Fair value of securities and others that are traded in an active market is determined using 
the  quoted  prices.  If  there  is  no  quoted  price,  fair  value  is  determined  using  external 
professional valuation institutions. The institutions use one or more valuation techniques 
that  are  deemed  appropriate  considering  the  characteristics  of  the  financial  instruments 
among  DCF  Model,  Free  Cash  Flow  to  Equity  Model,  Comparable  Company  Analysis, 
Dividend  Discount  Model,  Risk  Adjusted  Discount  Rate  Method,  and  Net  Asset  Value 
Method. 
 
Fair value of loans is determined using DCF Model discounting the expected cash flows, 
which  are  contractual  cash  flows  adjusted  by  the  expected  prepayment  rate,  at  an 
appropriate discount rate. 
 
Fair value of exchange traded derivatives is determined using  quoted  price  in  an active 
market, and fair value of OTC derivatives is determined using valuation techniques. The 
Group  uses  internally  developed  valuation  models  that  are  widely  used  by  market 
participants  to  determine  fair  value  of  plain  vanilla  OTC  derivatives  including  options, 
interest  rate  swaps,  and  currency  swaps,  based  on  observable  market  parameters. 
However,  some  complex  financial  instruments  are  valued  using  appropriate  models 
developed  from  generally  accepted  market  valuation  models  including  Finite  Difference 
Method  (“FDM”),  MonteCarlo  Simulation,  Black-Scholes  Model,  Hull  and  White  Model, 
Closed Form, and Tree Model or valuation results from independent external professional 
valuation institutions. 
 
Carrying amount of demand deposits is a reasonable approximation of fair value because 
they do not have a fixed maturity and are payable on demand. Fair value of time deposits 
is  determined  using  DCF  Model  discounting  the  expected  cash  flows,  which  are 
contractual  cash  flows  adjusted  by  the  expected  prepayment  rate,  at  an  appropriate 
discount rate. 
 
Carrying  amount  of  overdrafts  in  foreign  currency  is  a  reasonable  approximation  of  fair 
value because they do not have a fixed maturity and are payable on demand. Fair value of 
other borrowings is determined using DCF Model. 
 
Fair  value  is  determined  using  valuation  results  of  external  professional  valuation 
institutions, which are calculated using market inputs. 
 
Carrying  amount  is  a  reasonable  approximation  of  fair  value  because  other  financial 
assets  and  other  financial  liabilities  are  temporary  accounts  used  for  other  various 
transactions and their maturities are relatively short or not defined.SecuritiesLoans

orderly transaction between market participants. The Group discloses the fair value of each class of assets 
and liabilities in a way that permits it to be compared with its carrying amount at the end of each reporting 
period. The best evidence of fair value of financial instruments is a quoted price in an active market.8687118INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 20206.1.2 Fair value hierarchy 
 
The Group believes that valuation techniques used for measuring the fair value of financial instruments are 
reasonable and that the fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position is appropriate. 
However,  the  fair  value  of  the  financial  instruments  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial 
position may be different if other valuation techniques or assumptions are used. Additionally, as there are a 
variety of valuation techniques and assumptions used in measuring fair value, it may be difficult to reasonably 
compare the fair value with that of other financial institutions. 
 
The Group classifies and  discloses fair value of the financial instruments into the three fair value  levels as 
follows: 
 
Level  1:  The  fair  values  are  based  on  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets  orliabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.Level  2:  The  fair  values  are  based  on  inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  included  within  Level  1  that  areobservable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.Level 3: The fair values are based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
 
The fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the 
lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. If an observable input requires an adjustment 
using  an  unobservable  input  and  that  adjustment  results  in  a  significantly  higher  or  lower  fair  value 
measurement, the resulting measurement would be categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.6.1.2.1 Fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities at fair value  in the consolidated statements of

Sensitivity analysis of financial instruments is performed to measure favorable and unfavorable changes in fair 
value of financial instruments which are affected by unobservable parameters, using a statistical technique. 
When the fair value is affected by more than one input parameter, the amounts represent the most favorable 
or most unfavorable outcome. Level 3 financial instruments subject to sensitivity analysis are (a) equity-related 
derivatives,  currency-related  derivatives,  and  interest  rate  related  derivatives  whose  fair  value  changes  are 
recognized in profit or loss, (b) financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, and (c) due 
from  financial  institutions,  debt  securities  (including  beneficiary  certificates),  equity  securities,  and  loans 
whose fair value changes are recognized in profit or loss or other comprehensive income or loss. If the overlay 
approach is applied in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1104, changes in fair value of financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss are recognized in other comprehensive income.

such as correlation between discount rate (-1%p~1%p) and growth rate (-1%p~1%p) or correlation between 
liquidation value (-1%p~1%p) and discount rate (-1%p~1%p).4  For  beneficiary  certificates,  it  is  practically  impossible  to  analyze  sensitivity  of  changes  in  unobservable 
inputs. However, for beneficiary certificates whose underlying assets are real estates, changes in fair value 
are calculated by shifting rate of real estate price fluctuation by -1%p~1%p, and for beneficiary certificates 
whose underlying assets are equity investments, changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal 
unobservable input  parameters such as liquidation value by -1%p~1%p and  discount rate  by -1%p~1%p.

When the Group measures the fair value of OTC derivatives using inputs that are not based on observable 
market data, there could be a difference between the transaction price and the amount determined using that 
valuation  technique.  In  these  circumstances,  the  fair  value  of  financial  instruments  is  recognized  as  the 
transaction price, and the difference is not recognized in profit or loss but deferred and amortized using the 
straight-line method over the life of the financial instrument. When the fair value of the financial instruments is

9.6 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform 
 
The USD LIBOR interest rate will be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) based on 
actual transactions. In the case of KRW, the Korean government bond/monetary stabilization bond RP rate 
has been finally decided as the Risk-Free Reference Rate (“RFR”) and will replace the Certificate of Deposit 
(“CD”) rate in the mid to long-term. Within the corresponding hedging relationship of related significant interest 
rate benchmark, the Group assumed that the spread to be changed on the RFR basis including SOFR would 
be similar to that included in the interest rate swap used as a hedging instrument, and no other changes were 
assumed. 
 
Details of the Group’s exposure to hedging relationships related to the interest rate benchmark reform as of 
December 31, 2021, are as follows:

For  impairment  testing,  goodwill  is  allocated  to  cash-generating  units  that  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the 
synergies of the business combination, and cash-generating units consist of an operating segment or units 
which are not larger than an operating segment. 
 
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually and whenever 
there is an indication that the unit may be impaired, by comparing the carrying amount of the unit including the 
goodwill with the recoverable amount of the unit. 
 
The  recoverable  amount  of  a  cash-generating  unit  is  measured  at  the  higher  of  its  fair  value  less  costs  of 
disposal and its value in use. The fair value less costs of disposal is the amount obtainable from the disposal 
in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, after deducting the costs of disposal. If 
it  is  difficult  to  measure  the  amount  obtainable  from  the  disposal  of  the  cash-generating  unit,  the  disposal 
amount of a similar cash-generating unit in the past transaction is used by reflecting the characteristics of the 
cash-generating  unit  to  be  measured.  If  it  is  not  possible  to  obtain  reliable  information  to  measure  the  fair 
value less costs of disposal, the Group uses the asset’s value in use as its recoverable amount. Value in use 
is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit. The 
estimated  future  cash  flows  are  based  on  the  most  recent  financial  budget  approved  by  management  with 
maximum period of 5 years. In relation to subsequent cash flows, it is assumed that cash flows will grow at a 
certain  permanent  growth  rate.  The  key  assumptions  used  for  the  estimation  of  the  future  cash  flows  are 
based  on  the  market  size  and  the  Group’s  market  share.  The  discount  rate  is  a  pre-tax  rate  that  reflects 
assumptions  regarding  risk-free  interest  rate,  market  risk  premium,  and  the  risks  specific  to  the  cash-
generating unit.157158155INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries

* Fair value of the liability component of exchangeable bonds is calculated by using market interest rate of 
bonds  under  the  same  conditions  without  the  exchange  right.  The  residual  amount  after  deducting  the 
liability component from the issuance amount, represents the value of the exchange right and is recorded in 
equity. Shares to be exchanged are 5 million treasury shares of KB Financial Group Inc. with the exchange 
price of ₩ 48,000. Exercise period for exchange right is from the 60th day of the issuance date to 10 days 
before the maturity date.(30,217)

Provisions for restoration costs are the present value of estimated costs to be incurred for the restoration of 
the leased properties. The expenditure of the restoration cost will be incurred at the end of each lease contract, 
and the  lease period is used to reasonably estimate  the time of  expenditure.  Also, the  average restoration 
expense based on actual three-year historical data and three-year historical average inflation rate are used to 
estimate the present value of estimated costs.

25.1 Defined Benefit Plan 
 
The Group operates defined benefit plans which have the following characteristics:- 
-The Group has the obligation to pay the agreed benefits to all its current and former employees. 
The Group assumes actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more than expected) and investment risk.The net defined benefit liabilities recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position are calculated 
by the independent actuary in accordance with actuarial valuation method. The defined benefit obligation is 
calculated using the projected unit credit method. Assumptions based on market data and historical data such 
as discount rate, future salary increase rate, mortality, and consumer price index are used which are updated 
annually. 
 
Actuarial  assumptions  may  differ  from  actual  results,  due  to  changes  in  the  market  conditions,  economic 
trends,  and  mortality  trends  which  may  affect  net  defined  benefit  liabilities  and  future  payments.  Actuarial 
gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in the period incurred through 
other comprehensive income.

Mortality  assumptions  are  based  on  the  experience-based  mortality  table  issued  by  Korea  Insurance

The above sensitivity analysis is based  on  a change in  an  assumption while holding all  other  assumptions 
constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. 
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in significant actuarial assumptions is calculated 
using the same projected unit credit method used in calculating the defined benefit obligation recognized in 
the consolidated statement of financial position.

Basic earnings per share (A/B) 
 
37.2 Diluted Earnings per Share 
 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated through increasing the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding by the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding 
assuming  the  conversion  of  all  dilutive  potential  ordinary  shares.  The  Group  has  dilutive  potential  ordinary 
shares such as stock grants and ordinary share exchange right of exchangeable bonds. 
 
A  calculation  is  done  to  determine  the  number  of  shares  that  could  have  been  acquired  at  fair  value 
(determined as the average market share price for the year) based on the monetary value of stock grants. The 
number  of  shares  calculated  above  is  compared  with  the  number  of  shares  that  would  have  been  issued 
assuming the settlement of stock grants. 
 
Exchangeable bonds are included in potential ordinary shares from the exercisable date of the exchange right, 
and interest expense after tax for the period is added to profit for diluted earnings per share.202203179INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWKB Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries

According to the revision of the Detailed Regulations on Supervision of Insurance Business, the criteria for the 
insurance  liability  adequacy  test  were  changed,  and  the  Group  accounted  for  the  change  as  a  change  in 
accounting policy because it provided reliable and more relevant information about current estimates of future 
cash  flows.  This  change  in  accounting  policy  has  no  effect  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  but 
comparative notes have been restated.

38.5 Risk Management of KB Insurance Co., Ltd. 
 
38.5.1 Overview of insurance risk 
 
Insurance risk is the risk that arises from a primary operation of insurance companies that is associated with 
underwriting  of  insurance  contracts  and  payment  of  claims  and  is  classified  as  insurance  price  risk  and 
reserves  risk.  Insurance  price  risk  is  the  risk  of  loss  that  might  occur  when  the  actual  risk  exceeds  the 
expected risk ratio  or expected expense ratio set  at the time  of calculating  insurance premium, that  is, the 
possibility  of  loss  due  to  the  differences  between  actual  payment  of  claims  and  premiums  received  from 
policyholders. Reserve risk means the risk of not being able to cover actual claim payments in the future due 
to a lack of reserve accumulated at the time of assessment.38.5.2 Purposes, policies, and procedures to manage risk arising from insurance contracts 
 
The  risks  associated  with  insurance  contracts  that  the  Group  faces  are  insurance  actuarial  risk  and 
underwriting risk. Each risk occurs due to insurance contract’s pricing and conditions of underwriting. In order 
to  minimize  the  possibility  of  acquiring  a  bad  contract,  the  Group  has  established  and  operated  detailed 
underwriting  guidelines  and  underwriting  procedures  by  insurance  type  that  specify  detailed  underwriting 
conditions  according  to  the  type  of  risk  covered  through  pre-analysis  of  insured  property.  In  addition,  the 
Group  is  making  efforts  to  reduce  insurance  actuarial  risk  by  follow-up  measures  such  as  adjustments  of 
premium  rate,  changes  of  sales  conditions,  termination  of  selling  specific  product,  development  of  new 
product, and others through comparing and analyzing the expected risk level at the date of pricing and actual 
risk level after the acceptance. The Group has prepared a process to minimize management risk other than 
insurance actuarial risk and underwriting risk by operating a committee that shares opinions on underwriting 
policies and premium rate policies and decides important matters. 
 
In addition, by establishing a reinsurance operating strategy according to the reinsurance operating standards, 
the  Group  is  preparing  for  the  possibility  of  incurring  high  claim  expenses  at  once  due  to  unexpected 
catastrophic accidents while maintaining an appropriate holding level considering the solvency of the Group. 
The Group supports the protection and stable interests of policyholders, and comprehensively manages risks 
to maximize corporate value in the mid to long term. 
 
38.5.3 Exposure to insurance price risk 
 
According to Risk Based Capital (“RBC”) standard, exposure to insurance price risk is measured as the risk 
retained premium for all insurance contracts based on the track record for one year up to reference date of 
calculation. The risk retained premium is measured by adding assumed risk reinsurance premium to direct risk 
premium and deducting ceded risk reinsurance premium.

The Group is selling various insurance contracts such as general non-life  insurances (fire, maritime,  injury, 
technology, liability, package, title, guarantee, and other special type insurances), automobile insurances (for 
private use, for business use, for commercial use, bicycle, and others), long-term insurances (long-term non-
life, property damage, injury, driver, savings, illness, nursing, and pension), and others. The Group’s risk is 
distributed  through  reinsurance,  joint  acceptance,  and  sales  of  diversified  insurance  products.  In  addition, 
insurances  such  as  storm  and  flood  insurance,  which  have  a  very  low  probability  of  occurrence  but  cover 
severe levels of risk, are controlled through acceptance limit and joint acquisition. 
 
38.5.5 Claims development tables 
 
The Group verifies and evaluates the adequacy of reserve for outstanding claims for general, automobile, and 
long-term  insurance  with  two  or  more  methods,  including  paid  loss  development  trend  and  incurred  loss 
development  trend.  If  the  individually  estimated  claims  are  insufficient,  the  Group  recognizes  additional

The Group manages insurance risk by performing sensitivity analysis based on lapse ratio, loss ratio, expense 
ratio, discount rate, and others which are considered to have significant influence on future cash flow, timing, 
and  uncertainty.  Sensitivity  analysis  of  insurance  liabilities  was  conducted  only  in  the  unfavorable  direction 
where  additional  insurance  liabilities  could  be  reserved  as  the  surplus  was  sufficient  as  a  result  of  the 
insurance liability adequacy test.

December 31, 2021 and 202038.5.7 Liquidity risk of insurance contracts 
 
Liquidity  risk  arising  from  insurance  contracts  arises  from  the  increase  in  refunds  at  maturity  caused  by 
concentrations  of  maturity,  the  excessive  increase  in  surrender  values  caused  by  unexpected  mass 
cancelation,  and  the  increase  in  payments  of  claims  caused  by  major  accidents.  The  Group  manages 
payment of refunds at maturity by analyzing remaining maturity of insurance contracts.

Credit  risk  of  an  insurance  contract  refers  to  economic  losses  in  which  the  reinsurer,  the  counterparty,  is 
unable to fulfil its contract obligations due to a decline in credit ratings or default or others. Through an internal 
review,  only  the  insurers  rated  BBB-  or  higher  of  S&P  rating  or  corresponding  rating  are  selected  as 
reinsurance companies.

38.5.9 Interest rate risk of insurance contract 
 
Interest rate risk exposure from the Group’s insurance contracts is the risk of unexpected losses due to the 
fluctuations of net interest  income or  net assets arising from changes  in interest rate and  it  is managed  to 
minimize unexpected losses. The Group calculates exposure to interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing 
liabilities  for  long-term,  non-life  insurance  contracts.  Liabilities  exposure  is  premium  reserve  less  surrender 
charge plus unearned premium reserve. Assets exposure is interest-bearing assets and assets that generate 
only fees without interest income are excluded from interest-bearing assets. Exposures to interest rate risk as 
of December 31, 2021 and 2020, are as follows:

38.7.1 Overview of insurance risk 
 
Insurance risk is the risk that arises from a primary operation of insurance companies that is associated with 
underwriting  of  insurance  contracts  and  payment  of  claims  and  refers  to  the  possibility  of  losses  that  may 
occur  because  the  risk  at  the  time  of  claim  payment  is  greater  than  the  risk  expected  at  the  time  of 
underwriting. Insurance risk can be divided into insurance price risk and policy reserve risk. 
 
Insurance  price  risk  is  the  possibility  of  loss  due  to  the  differences  between  actual  payment  of  claims  and 
premiums received from policyholders. 
 
Policy reserve risk is possibility of loss due to the differences between policy reserve and actual claims to be 
paid in the future. Therefore, losses are recognized if actual claims are more than policy reserve. 
 
Life insurance company measures mainly insurance price risk and manages policy reserve risk using liability 
adequacy test because life insurance claim payments are mainly in a fixed amount with less volatility and the 
period from insured event to claim payments is not long. 
 
38.7.2 Insurance risk management 
 
The Group considers insurance risk inherent in products from the time of product development and continues 
to  measure  and  mitigate  insurance  risk  in  various  ways  after  launch.  Insurance  risk  related  to  death  and 
illness are mitigated through reinsurance, and the Group selects an appropriate reinsurer based on credit risk 
and  determines  the  appropriate  level  of  insurance  risk  exposure  for  each  reinsurer  prior  to  entering  into  a 
contract with the reinsurer. The Group manages insurance risk through voluntary reinsurance for the amount 
in excess of the predetermined insurance risk retention limit. 
 
In addition, the Group monitors the  loss ratio, effect of selection, and others every quarter, measures risks 
through an internal model, and reports the results to the Risk Management Committee. 
 
38.7.3 Exposure to insurance price risk 
 
The  exposure  to  insurance  price  risk  is  measured  as  the  risk  retained  premium  for  all  insurance  contracts 
based  on  the  track  record  for  one  year  up  to  reference  date  of  calculation.  The  risk  retained  premium  is 
measured  by  adding  assumed  risk  reinsurance  premium  to  direct  risk  premium  and  deducting  ceded  risk 
reinsurance premium. If the risk retained premium is less than zero, the exposure to insurance price risk is 
measured as zero. 
 
Maximum exposures to insurance price risk as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, are as follows:

measuring  insurance  liabilities  at  every  reporting  period.  However,  in  the  case  of  variable  interest  type 
insurance,  adjusted  interest  rate  reflecting  the  external  index  interest  rate  according  to  Article  6-12  of  the 
Regulations on Supervision of Insurance Business and disclosed interest rate reflecting the rate of return on 
managed assets stated in the premium and policy reserve calculation manual are used. 
 
Reserve amount should be equal to or more than the standard reserve which is calculated using the standard 
interest rate and standard risk ratio as prescribed by the Enforcement Rules of the Insurance Business Act 
and the Regulations on Supervision of Insurance Business. 
 
38.7.6 Liquidity risk of insurance contracts 
 
Liquidity  risk  arising  from  insurance  contracts  arises  from  the  increase  in  refunds  at  maturity  caused  by 
concentrations  of  maturity,  the  excessive  increase  in  surrender  values  caused  by  unexpected  mass 
cancelation,  and  the  increase  in  payments  of  claims  caused  by  major  accidents.  The  Group  manages 
payment of refunds at maturity by analyzing remaining maturity of insurance contracts. 
 
Maturity structure of premium reserve and unearned premium reserve as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, 
are as follows:

KB Financial Group Inc.Opinion
We have audited the separate financial statements of KB Financial Group Inc. (“the Company”), which comprise 
the separate statements of financial position as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the separate statements of 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and notes, comprising a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.In  our  opinion,  the  accompanying  separate  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the 
separate financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and its separate financial 
performance and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with Korean International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“K-IFRS”).We also have audited, in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing (KSAs), the Company’s Internal Control 
over Financial Reporting (“ICFR”) as of December 31, 2021 based on the criteria established in Conceptual 
Framework  for  Designing  and  Operating  Internal  Control  over  Financial  Reporting  issued  by  the  Operating 
Committee of Internal Control over Financial Reporting in the Republic of Korea, and our report dated March 
17, 2022 expressed an unmodified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting.Basis for Opinion
We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  KSAs.  Our  responsibilities  under  those  standards  are  further 
described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Separate Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to 
our audit of the separate financial statements in Republic of Korea, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.Emphasis of Matter
As a matter that does not affect our audit opinion, we draw attention to the following matter.As described in note 30.2.b) to the separate financial statements, the proliferation of COVID-19 has had a 
negative influence on the global economy, which may have a greater impact on expected credit losses and 
potential impairment of assets in a particular portfolio, and it could negatively affect the revenue generation 
capability of the Company.Key Audit Matters
We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Separate Financial 
Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the separate financial statements in 
accordance with K-IFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of separate financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.In preparing the separate financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, 
or has no realistic alternative but to do so.Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Separate Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the separate financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with KSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these separate financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with KSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:∙  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the separate financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.∙  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that areappropriate in the circumstances.∙  Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  separate  financial 
statements and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.∙  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, basedon the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that212INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTIONSeparate Statements of Financial PositionNotesDecember 31, 2021December 31, 20204,5,6,29

material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures 
in the separate financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.∙  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the separate financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the separate financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in the internal controls 
that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that 
may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were 
of most significance in the audit of the separate financial statements of the current period and are therefore 
the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not  be  communicated  in  our  report  because  the  adverse  consequences  of  doing  so  would  reasonably  be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Young-Min Kwon.KPMG Samjong Accounting Corp.

2. Basis of Preparation 
 
2.1 Application of Korean IFRS 
 
The Company maintains its accounting records in Korean won and prepares statutory financial statements in 
the  Korean  language  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  as  adopted  by  the 
Republic of Korea (“Korean IFRS”). The accompanying separate financial statements have been translated into 
English from the Korean language separate financial statements. 
 
The  separate  financial  statements  of  the  Company  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Korean  IFRS. 
Korean IFRS are the standards and related interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (“IASB”) that have been adopted by the Republic of Korea. 
 
The  preparation  of  separate  financial  statements  requires  the  use  of  certain  critical  accounting  estimates. 
Management also needs to exercise judgment in applying the Company's accounting policies. The areas that 
require  a  more  complex  and  higher  level  of  judgment  or  areas  that  require  significant  assumptions  and 
estimations are disclosed in Note 2.4. 
 
The separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1027 Separate 
Financial Statements.215INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION216INTRODUCTIONOPERATION REVIEWMD&AGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYKB Financial Group Inc.

- Annual improvements to Korean IFRS 2018-2020 
 
Annual  improvements  of  Korean  IFRS  2018-2020  Cycle  should  be  applied  for  annual  reporting  periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2022, and earlier application is permitted. The Company does not expect that 
these amendments have a significant impact on the financial statements.

The separate financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise 
specified. 
 
2.3 Functional and Presentation Currency 
 
Items included in the separate financial statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the Company operates (“functional currency”). The separate financial 
statements are presented in Korean won, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. 
 
2.4 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
The Company applies accounting policies and uses judgements, accounting estimates, and assumptions that 
may  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  assets  (liabilities)  and  incomes  (expenses)  in  preparing  the  separate 
financial statements. Management’s estimates of outcomes may differ from actual outcomes if management’s 
estimates and assumptions based on management’s best judgment are different from the actual environment. 
 
Estimates and underlying  assumptions are continually evaluated,  and changes in accounting estimates are 
recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed and in any future periods affected. 
 
Uncertainties in estimates and assumptions with significant risks that may result in material adjustments to the 
separate financial statements are as follows: 
 
2.4.1 Income taxes 
 
As the income taxes on the Company’s taxable income is calculated by applying the tax laws of various countries 
and the decisions of tax authorities, there is uncertainty in calculating the final tax effect. 
 
If a certain portion of the taxable income is not used for investments, wages, etc. in accordance with the Korean 
regulation  called  ‘Special  Taxation  for  Facilitation  of  Investment  and  Mutually-beneficial  Cooperation’,  the 
Company  is  liable  to  pay  additional  income  tax  calculated  based  on  the  tax  laws.  Therefore,  the  effect  of 
recirculation of corporate income should be reflected in current and deferred income tax. As the Company’s 
income  tax  is  dependent  on  the  actual  investments,  wages,  etc.  per  each  year,  there  are  uncertainties  in 
measuring the final tax effects during the period when the tax law is applied.APPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION

December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 
2.4.2 Fair value of financial instruments 
 
The fair value of financial instruments where no active market exists or where quoted prices are not otherwise 
available is determined by using valuation techniques. Financial instruments, which are not actively traded in 
the market and those with less transparent market prices, will have less objective fair values and require broad 
judgment on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty in market factors, assumptions in fair value determination, and 
other risks. 
 
As  described  in  the  significant  accounting  policies  in  Note  3.1  Recognition  and  Measurement  of  Financial 
Instruments, diverse valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, from 
generally accepted market valuation models to internally developed valuation models that incorporate various 
types of assumptions and variables. 
 
2.4.3 Net defined benefit liability 
 
The present value of the net defined benefit liability is affected by changes in the various factors determined by 
the actuarial method.1121710INTRODUCTIONOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXMD&AGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYKB Financial Group Inc.

3. Significant Accounting Policies 
 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these separate financial statements are set out 
below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
 
3.1 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments 
 
3.1.1 Initial recognition 
 
The Company recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when the 
Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A regular way purchase or sale of 
financial assets (a purchase or sale of a financial asset under a contract whose terms require delivery of the 
asset within the time frame established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned) is 
recognized and derecognized using trade date accounting. 
 
For financial reporting purpose, the Company classifies (a) financial assets as financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, or financial assets at 
amortized  cost  and  (b)  financial  liabilities  as  financial  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  or  other 
financial liabilities. These classifications are based on the business model for managing financial instruments 
and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial instrument at initial recognition. 
 
At initial recognition, a financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case 
of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability. The fair value is defined as the 
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants. The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price 
(that is, the fair value of the consideration given or received) in an arm’s length transaction. 
 
3.1.2 Subsequent measurement 
 
After initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at amortized cost or fair value based on classification 
at initial recognition. 
 
3.1.2.1 Amortized cost 
 
The amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial 
liability  is  measured  at  initial  recognition  minus  the  principal  repayments,  plus  or  minus  the  cumulative 
amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity 
amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance. 
 
3.1.2.2 Fair value 
 
The Company uses quoted price  in an active  market which  is based on  listed  market price  or dealer  price 
quotations  of  financial  instruments  traded  in  an  active  market  as  best  estimate  of  fair  value.  A  financial 
instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from 
an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent 
actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.FINANCIAL SECTION
KB Financial Group Inc. 
Notes to the Separate Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 
3.1.2.2 Fair value (cont’d) 
 
If  there  is  no  active  market  for  a  financial  instrument,  fair  value  is  determined  either  by  using  a  valuation 
technique or independent third-party valuation service. Valuation techniques include using recent arm's length 
market transactions between knowledgeable and willing parties, if available, referencing the current fair value 
of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, and option pricing models. 
 
The Company uses valuation models that are commonly used by market participants and customized for the 
Company to determine fair values of common over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives such as options, interest rate 
swaps, and currency swaps which are based on the inputs observable in markets. However, for some complex 
financial instruments that require fair value measurement by valuation techniques based on certain assumptions 
because some or all inputs used in the model are not observable in the market, the Company uses internal 
valuation  models  developed  from  general  valuation  models  or  valuation  results  from  independent  external 
valuation institutions. 
 
In  addition,  the  fair  value  information  recognized  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  is  classified  into  the 
following fair value hierarchy, reflecting the significance of the input variables used in the fair value measurement. 
 
  Level 1 : Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company canaccess at the measurement dateeither directly or indirectlyLevel 2 : Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,Level 3 : Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
 
The fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the 
lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. For this purpose, the significance of an input is 
assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety. 
 
If  a  fair  value  measurement  uses  observable  inputs  that  require  significant  adjustment  using  unobservable 
inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement. 
 
If the valuation technique does not reflect all factors which market participants would consider in pricing the 
asset or liability, the fair value is adjusted to reflect those factors. Those factors include counterparty credit risk, 
bid-ask spread, liquidity risk, and others. 
 
The Company uses valuation technique which maximizes the use of market inputs and minimizes the use of 
entity-specific inputs. It incorporates all factors that market participants would consider in pricing the asset or 
liability and is consistent with economic methodologies applied for pricing financial instruments. Periodically, the 
Company calibrates the valuation technique and tests its validity using  prices of observable current market 
transactions of the same instrument or based on other relevant observable market data.1213218INTRODUCTIONMD&AOPERATION REVIEWGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYKB Financial Group Inc.

December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 
3.1.3 Derecognition 
 
Derecognition is the removal of a previously recognized financial asset or financial liability from the statement 
of financial position. The derecognition criteria for financial assets and financial liabilities are as follows: 
 
3.1.3.1 Derecognition of financial assets 
 
A financial asset is derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire 
or the Company transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of  ownership of the financial  asset, or the 
Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset 
and the Company has not retained control. Therefore, if the Company does not transfer substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the Company continues to recognize the financial asset 
to the extent of its continuing involvement in the financial asset. 
 
If  the  Company  transfers  the  contractual  rights  to  receive  the  cash  flows  of  the  financial  asset  but  retains 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the Company continues to recognize 
the transferred asset in its entirety and recognize a financial liability for the consideration received. 
 
The Company writes off a financial asset when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering a 
financial  asset  in  its  entirety  or  a  portion  thereof.  In  general,  the  Company  considers  write-off  when  it  is 
determined that the debtor does not have sufficient funds or income to cover the principal and interest. The 
write-off decision is made in accordance with internal regulations. After the write-off, the Company can collect 
the written-off loans continuously according to the internal policy. Recovered amounts from financial assets 
previously written-off are recognized in profit or loss. 
 
3.1.3.2 Derecognition of financial liabilities 
 
A financial liability is derecognized from the statement of financial position when it is extinguished (i.e., the 
obligation specified in the contract is discharged, canceled or expires). 
 
3.1.4 Offsetting 
 
A financial asset and a financial liability are offset, and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial 
position when, and only when, the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized 
amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on a future event and must be legally enforceable in the 
normal course of business, the event of default, and the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company and 
all of the counterparties. 
 
3.2 Cash and Due from Financial Institutions 
 
Cash and due from financial institutions include cash on hand, foreign currency, and short-term, highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk 
of changes in value, and due from financial institutions. Cash and due from financial institutions are measured 
at amortized cost.APPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION

Notes to the Separate Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 
3.3 Non-derivative Financial Assets 
 
3.3.1 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
 
Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss unless they are classified 
as financial assets at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. 
 
The Company may designate certain financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or 
loss  when  the  designation  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  a  measurement  or  recognition  inconsistency 
(sometimes  referred  to  as  an  ‘accounting  mismatch’)  that  would  otherwise  arise  from  measuring  assets  or 
liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on different bases. 
 
After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is measured at fair value and gains 
or losses arising from a change in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. Interest income using the effective 
interest method and dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are also recognized 
in profit or loss. 
 
3.3.2 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 
 
The Company classifies below financial assets as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income: 
-  Debt instruments that are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting 
contractual cash  flows and selling financial assets,  and where  the assets’ cash flows represent solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and;-  Equity instruments that are not held for short-term trading but held for strategic investment, and designatedas financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive incomeAfter initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income is measured at fair 
value. Gains or losses arising from a change in fair value, other than dividend income, interest income calculated 
using the effective interest method and exchange differences arising on monetary items which are recognized 
directly in profit or loss, are recognized in other comprehensive income in equity. 
 
When the financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is disposed of, the cumulative gain 
or  loss  previously  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  reclassified  from  equity  to  profit  or  loss. 
However, cumulative gain or loss of equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive 
income is reclassified to retained earnings not to profit or loss at disposal. 
 
A financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income denominated in foreign currency is translated 
at the closing rate. Exchange differences resulting from changes in amortized cost are recognized in profit or 
loss, and other changes are recognized in equity. 
 
3.3.3 Financial assets at amortized cost 
 
A financial asset, which is held within the business model whose objective is achieved by collecting contractual 
cash flows, and where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding, is classified as a financial asset at amortized cost. After initial recognition, a financial asset 
at amortized cost is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method and interest income is 
calculated using the effective interest method.1415219OPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXINTRODUCTIONMD&AGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYKB Financial Group Inc. 
Notes to the Separate Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 
3.4 Expected Credit Losses of Financial Assets (Debt Instruments) 
 
The  Company  recognizes  loss  allowances  for  expected  credit  losses  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  for 
financial assets at amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income except for financial assets 
at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
Expected credit losses are estimated at present value of probability-weighted amount that is determined by 
evaluating  a  range  of  possible  outcomes.  The  Company  measures  expected  credit  losses  by  reflecting  all 
reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about 
past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions. 
 
The approaches of measuring expected credit losses in accordance with Korean IFRS are as follows:-  General  approach:  for  financial  assets  and  unused  loan  commitments  not  subject  to  the  below  2approaches-  Simplified approach: for trade receivables, contract assets, and lease receivables 
-  Credit-impaired approach: for financial assets that are credit-impaired at the time of acquisitionApplication of general approach is differentiated depending on whether credit risk has increased significantly 
after initial recognition. If the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial 
recognition, the Company measures loss allowances for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-
month expected credit losses, whereas if the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly 
since initial recognition, the Company measures loss allowances for a financial instrument at an amount equal 
to  the  lifetime  expected  credit  losses.  Lifetime  is  the  period  until  the  contractual  maturity  date  of  financial 
instruments and means the expected life. 
 
The Company assesses whether the credit risk has increased significantly using the following criteria, and if 
one or more of the following criteria are met, it is deemed as significant increase in credit risk. If the contractual 
cash flows of a financial asset have been renegotiated or modified, the Company assesses whether the credit 
risk has increased significantly using the same following criteria.-  More than 30 days past due 
-  Decline in credit rating at the end of the reporting period by certain notches or more compared to thetime of initial recognition-  Debt restructuring (except for impaired financial assets) and 
-  Credit delinquency information of Korea Federation of Banks, etc.Under  simplified  approach,  the  Company  always  measures  loss  allowances  at  an  amount  equal  to  lifetime 
expected credit losses. Under credit-impaired approach, the Company only recognizes the cumulative changes 
in lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition as loss allowances at the end of the reporting period. 
In assessing credit impairment, the Company uses definition of default as in the new Basel Accord which rules 
calculation of Capital Adequacy Ratio. 
 
The Company generally considers the loan to be credit-impaired if one or more of the following criteria are met:90 days or more past due 
Legal proceedings related to collection-

3.4.1 Forward-looking information 
 
The  Company  uses  forward-looking  information,  when  determining  whether  credit  risk  has  increased 
significantly and measuring expected credit losses. 
 
The Company assumes that the risk components have a constant correlation with the economic cycle and uses 
statistical methodologies to estimate the relation between key macroeconomic variables and risk components 
for the expected credit losses. 
 
The correlation between the major macroeconomic variables and the credit risk are as follows:Correlation between the major macroeconomicvariables and the credit riskKey macroeconomic variablesDomestic GDP growth rate 
Composite stock index 
Rate of change of construction investment 
Rate of change of housing transaction price index 
Interest rate spread 
Private consumption growth rate(-)

(-)Forward-looking  information  used  in  calculation  of  expected  credit  losses  is  based  on  the  macroeconomic 
forecasts utilized by management of the Company for its business plan considering reliable external agency’s 
forecasts  and  others.  The  forward-looking  information  is  generated  by  KB  Research  with  a  comprehensive 
approach to capture the possibility of various economic forecast scenarios that are derived from the internal and 
external viewpoints of the macroeconomic situation. The Company determines the macroeconomic variables to 
be used in forecasting future conditions of the economy, considering the direction of the forecast scenario and 
the  significant  relationship  between  macroeconomic  variables  and  time  series  data.  And  there  are  some 
changes compared to the macroeconomic variables used in the previous year. 
 
3.4.2 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at amortized cost 
 
The expected credit losses of financial assets at amortized cost are measured as present value of the difference 
between the contractual cash flows to be received and the cash flows expected to be received. The Company 
estimates expected future cash flows for financial assets that are individually significant. The Company selects 
the individually significant financial assets by comprehensively considering quantitative and qualitative factors 
(such as debt restructuring or negative net assets, etc.) among financial assets with the credit risk has increased 
significantly or credit-impaired (individual assessment of impairment). 
 
For financial assets that  are not  individually significant, the Company collectively estimates expected credit 
losses by grouping loans with a homogeneous credit risk profile (collective assessment of impairment). 
 
3.4.2.1 Individual assessment of impairment 
 
Individual assessment of impairment losses is performed using management's best estimate on the present 
value of expected future cash flows. The Company uses all the available information including financial condition 
of the borrower such as operating cash flow and net realizable value of any collateral held.1617220INTRODUCTIONOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXMD&AGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYKB Financial Group Inc.

3.4.2.2 Collective assessment of impairment 
 
Collective  assessment  of  impairment  losses  is  performed  by  using  a  methodology  based  on  historical  loss 
experience and reflecting forward-looking information. Such a process incorporates factors such  as type  of 
collateral, type of product, type of borrower, credit rating, size of portfolio, and recovery period and applies 
Probability of Default (“PD”) on a group of assets and Loss Given Default (“LGD”) by type of recovery method. 
Also, the Company applies certain assumptions to model expected credit losses assessment and to determine 
input  based  on  loss  experience  and  forward-looking  information.  These  models  and  assumptions  are 
periodically reviewed to reduce the gap between loss estimate and actual loss experience. 
 
The lifetime expected credit losses are measured by applying the PD to the carrying amount calculated by 
deducting the expected principal repayment amount from the carrying amount as of the reporting date and the 
LGD adjusted to reflect changes in the carrying amount. 
 
3.4.3 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 
 
The Company measures expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income in a manner that is consistent with the requirements that are applicable to financial assets at amortized 
cost. However, loss allowances are recognized in other comprehensive income. Upon disposal or repayment of 
financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, the amount of loss allowances is reclassified 
from other comprehensive income to profit or loss. 
 
3.5 Revenue Recognition 
 
The  Company  recognizes  revenues  in  accordance  with  the  following  steps  determined  in  accordance  with 
Korean IFRS No.1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.FINANCIAL SECTION

3.5.1 Interest income and expense (cont’d) 
 
Interest income on impaired financial assets is recognized using the interest rate used to discount the expected 
cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. 
 
Interest income on debt securities at fair value through profit or loss is also classified as interest income in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
 
3.5.2 Fee and commission income 
 
The Company recognizes financial service fees in accordance with the purpose of charging the fees and the 
accounting standards of the financial instrument related to the fees earned. 
 
3.5.2.1 Fees that are an integral part of the effective interest of a financial instrument 
 
Such fees are generally treated as adjustments of effective interest rate. Such fees may include compensation 
for  activities  such  as  evaluating  the  borrower's  financial  condition,  evaluating  and  recording  guarantees, 
collateral and other security arrangements, negotiating the terms of the instrument, preparing and processing 
documents, and closing the transaction and origination fees received on issuing financial liabilities at amortized 
cost. However, fees relating to the creation or acquisition of a financial instrument at fair value through profit or 
loss are recognized as revenue immediately. 
 
3.5.2.2 Fees related to performance obligations satisfied over time 
 
If  the  control  of  a  good  or  service  is  transferred  over  time,  the  Company  recognizes  revenue  related  to 
performance obligations over the period of performance obligations. Fees charged in return for the services for 
a certain period of time, such as asset management fees, consignment business fees, etc. are recognized over 
the period of performance obligations. 
 
3.5.2.3 Fees related to performance obligations satisfied at a point in time 
 
Fees earned at a point in time are recognized as revenue when a customer obtains controls of a promised good 
or service and the Company satisfies a performance obligation. 
 
3.5.3 Net gains/losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss 
 
Net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (including changes in fair value, 
dividends, and gains or losses from foreign currency translation) include gains or losses on financial instruments 
as follows:-  Gains or losses relating to financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (excluding interestincome using the effective interest rate method)-  Gains or  losses relating to derivative financial  instruments for trading (including derivative financialinstruments for hedging purpose but do not qualify for hedge accounting)3.5.4 Dividend income 
 
Dividend income is recognized in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established. Dividend income 
is recognized as net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss or other operating 
income depending on the classification of equity securities.-  Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer. 
-  Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 
-  Step 3: Determine the transaction price. 
-  Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 
-  Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.3.5.1 Interest income and expense 
 
Interest  income  and  expense  on  debt  securities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  (excluding  beneficiary 
certificates, equity investments, and other debt securities), loans, financial instruments at amortized cost, and 
debt  securities  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  are  recognized  in  the  statement  of 
comprehensive income using the effective interest method in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1109 Financial 
Instruments. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or 
a financial liability and allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. 
 
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through 
the expected life of the financial instrument or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount 
of a financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, 
the Company estimates expected cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but 
does not consider expected credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid (main components 
of effective interest rate only) or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective 
interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts. In those rare cases when it is not possible 
to  reliably  estimate  the  cash  flows  and  the  expected  life  of  a  financial  instrument,  the  Company  uses  the 
contractual cash flows over the full contractual term of the financial instrument.1819221INTRODUCTIONMD&AOPERATION REVIEWGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYKB Financial Group Inc.

3.6 Investments in Subsidiaries and Associates 
 
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted at cost method in accordance with Korean IFRS 
No.1027. The Company determines at each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the 
investments in the subsidiaries and associates are impaired. If this is the case, the Company calculates the 
amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the subsidiaries or associates and 
its carrying value. 
 
3.7 Property and Equipment 
 
3.7.1 Recognition and measurement 
 
Property and equipment that qualify for recognition as an asset are measured at cost and subsequently carried 
at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
 
The cost of property and equipment includes any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location 
and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the initial 
estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located. 
 
Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when they prolong the useful life or enhance values of the assets 
but the costs of the day-to-day servicing of the assets such as repair and maintenance costs are recognized in 
profit or loss as incurred. When part of an item of property and equipment has a useful life different from that of 
the entire asset, it is recognized as a separate asset. 
 
3.7.2 Depreciation 
 
Land is not depreciated, whereas other property and equipment are depreciated using the method that reflects 
the pattern in which the asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Company. The 
depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value. 
 
Each part of an item of property and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the 
item is depreciated separately. 
 
The depreciation method and estimated useful life of property and equipment are as follows:Property and equipment

3.8 Intangible Assets 
 
Intangible assets are measured initially at cost and subsequently carried at their cost less any accumulated 
amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. 
 
Intangible assets, except for membership rights, are amortized using the straight-line method with no residual 
value over their estimated useful life since the assets are available for use.Intangible assetsSoftware 
OthersAmortization methodStraight-line 
Straight-lineEstimated useful life4 years4 ~ 19 yearsThe amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed 
at least at each financial year-end. Where an intangible asset is not being amortized because its useful life is 
indefinite,  the  Company  carries  out  a  review  in  each  accounting  period  to  confirm  whether  events  and 
circumstances still support an indefinite useful  life assessment. If they do not, the change in the  useful life 
assessment from indefinite to finite is accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate. 
 
3.9 Impairment of Non-financial Assets 
 
The Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that a non-financial 
asset, except for (a) deferred income tax assets, (b) assets arising from employee benefits and (c) non-current 
assets (or group of assets to be sold) classified as held for sale, may be impaired. If any such indication exists, 
the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. 
 
The recoverable amount is estimated for the individual asset. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable 
amount of the individual asset, the Company determines the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash 
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The recoverable 
amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Value in use is the 
present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit that are 
discounted by a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. 
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than  its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. That reduction is an impairment loss and recognized immediately in profit 
or loss. 
 
3.10 Provisions 
 
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a 
past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle 
the  obligation  and  a  reliable  estimate  can  be  made  of  the  amount  of  the  obligation.  Inevitable  risks  and 
uncertainties surrounding related events and circumstances are considered in measuring the best estimate of 
the provisions, and where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of provisions is the 
present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. 
 
Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.   
If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation, the provisions are reversed.2021222INTRODUCTIONMD&AOPERATION REVIEWGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYKB Financial Group Inc.

3.11 Equity Instrument Issued by the Company 
 
An equity instrument is any contract or agreement that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity 
after deducting all of its liabilities. 
 
3.11.1 Ordinary shares 
 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or the 
exercise of stock option are deducted from the equity, net of any tax effects. 
 
3.11.2 Hybrid securities 
 
The financial instruments can be classified as either financial liabilities or equity in accordance with the terms of 
the contract. The Company classifies hybrid securities as an equity if the Company has the unconditional right 
to  avoid  any  contractual  obligation  to  deliver  cash  or  another  financial  asset  in  relation  to  the  financial 
instruments. 
 
3.12 Employee Compensation and Benefits 
 
3.12.1 Post-employment benefits 
 
3.12.1.1 Defined contribution plans 
 
When  an  employee  has  rendered  service  to  the  Company  during  a  period,  the  Company  recognizes  the 
contribution payable to a defined contribution plan in exchange for that service as post-employment benefits for 
the period. 
 
3.12.1.2 Defined benefit plans 
 
All post-employment benefits, other than  defined contribution  plans, are classified as defined benefit plans.   
The amount recognized as a net defined benefit liability is the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
less the fair value of plan assets at the end of the reporting period. 
 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
Projected Unit Credit method. The rate used to discount post-employment benefit obligations is determined by 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. The currency and 
term of the corporate bonds are consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment benefit 
obligations.  Actuarial  gains  and  losses  resulted  from  changes  in  actuarial  assumptions  and  experience 
adjustments are recognized in other comprehensive income. 
 
When the present value of the defined benefit obligation minus the fair value of plan assets results in an asset, 
it is recognized to the extent of the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from 
the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. 
 
Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in 
prior periods, resulting from the introduction or changes to a defined benefit plan. Such past service cost is 
immediately recognized as an expense for the period.APPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION

3.12.2 Short-term employee benefits 
 
Short-term  employee  benefits  are  employee  benefits  that  are  expected  to  be  settled  wholly  before  twelve 
months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the related service. When 
an employee has rendered service to the Company during an accounting period, the Company recognizes the 
undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service as an 
expense for the period. 
 
The expected cost of profit-sharing and bonus payments is recognized as liabilities when the Company has a 
present legal or constructive obligation to make payments as a result of past events, such as service rendered 
by employees, and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. 
 
3.12.3 Share-based payment 
 
The Company provides stock grants program to executives and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
When stock grants are exercised, the Company can either select to distribute newly issued shares or treasury 
shares or compensate in cash based on the share price. 
 
For a share-based payment transaction in which the terms of the arrangement provide the Company with the 
choice of whether to settle in cash or by issuing equity instruments, the Company accounts for the transaction 
in accordance with the requirements applying to cash-settled share-based payment transactions because the 
Company determines that it has a present obligation to settle in cash based on a past practice and a stated 
policy of settling in cash. 
 
Therefore, the Company measures the liability incurred as consideration for the service received at fair value 
and recognizes related expense and accrued expense over the vesting periods. Until the liability is settled, the 
Company  remeasures  the  fair  value  of  the  liability  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period  and  at  the  date  of 
settlement, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss as share-based payments. 
 
3.12.4 Termination benefits 
 
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Company before the normal retirement 
date, or an employee’s decision to accept an offer of benefits in exchange for the termination of employment. 
The Company recognizes a liability and expense for termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates; 
when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Company recognizes costs 
for a restructuring that is within the scope of Korean IFRS No.1037 and involves the payment of termination 
benefits. If the termination benefits are not expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of 
the annual reporting period, then the termination benefits are discounted to present value.2223223INTRODUCTIONMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYKB Financial Group Inc.

3.13 Income Tax Expense 
 
Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and deferred income tax expense. Current and deferred 
income tax are recognized as income or expense and included in profit or loss for the period, except to the 
extent that the tax arises from (a) a transaction or event which is recognized, in the same or a different period, 
outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and (b) a business combination. 
 
3.13.1 Current income tax 
 
Current income tax is the amount of income tax payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) 
for a period. A difference between the taxable profit and accounting profit may arise when income or expense 
is included in accounting profit in one period but is included in taxable profit in a different period. Differences 
may also arise if there is revenue that is exempt from taxation, or expense that is not deductible in determining 
taxable profit (loss). Current income tax liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured using the tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. 
 
The Company offsets current income tax assets and current income tax liabilities if, and only if, the Company 
(a) has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and (b) intends either to settle on a net 
basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
 
3.13.2 Deferred income tax 
 
Deferred income tax is recognized, using the asset-liability method, on temporary differences arising between 
the tax-based amount of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the financial statements. Deferred 
income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred income tax assets are 
recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available  against  which  the  deductible  temporary  difference  can  be  utilized.  However,  deferred  income  tax 
liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination, and at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or 
loss. 
 
The  carrying  amount  of  a  deferred  income  tax  asset  is  reviewed  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period.  The 
Company reduces the carrying amount of a deferred income tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred income tax asset 
to be utilized. 
 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period 
when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred income tax liabilities 
and deferred income tax assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and 
liabilities. 
 
The Company offsets deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities if, and only if the Company 
has a legally enforceable right to set off current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the 
deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle 
current  income  tax  liabilities  and  assets  on  a  net  basis,  or  to  realize  the  assets  and  settle  the  liabilities 
simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred income tax liabilities or assets are 
expected to be settled or recovered.FINANCIAL SECTION

3.13.3 Uncertain tax positions 
 
Uncertain tax positions arise from tax treatments applied by the Company which may be challenged by the tax 
authorities due to the complexity of the transaction or different interpretation of the tax laws, such as a claim for 
rectification,  a  claim  for  a  refund  related  to  additional  tax  or  a  tax  investigation  by  the  tax  authorities.  The 
Company recognizes its uncertain tax positions in the financial statements in accordance with Korean IFRS 
No.1012 and Interpretation of Korean IFRS No.2123. The income tax asset is recognized if a tax refund is 
probable for taxes levied by the tax authority, and the amount to be paid as a result of the tax investigation and 
others is recognized as the current tax payable. However, penalty tax and additional refund on tax are regarded 
as penalty or interest and are accounted for in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1037. 
 
3.14 Earnings per Share 
 
The Company calculates basic earnings per share amounts and diluted earnings per share amounts for profit 
or loss for the period and presents them in the statement of comprehensive income. Basic earnings per share 
is calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by 
adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Parent Company and weighted average 
number of shares outstanding, taking into account all potential dilution effects, such as exchangeable bonds 
and share-based payments given to employees. 
 
3.15 Lease 
 
The Company as a lessor recognizes lease payments from operating leases as income on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in obtaining an operating lease are added to the carrying amount 
of the underlying asset and recognized as expense over the lease term on the same basis as lease income. 
The respective leased assets are included in the statement of financial position based on their nature. 
 
A lessee is required to recognize a right-of-use asset (lease assets) representing its right to use the underlying 
leased  asset and a lease liability representing  its obligation to make  lease  payments. Assets  and  liabilities 
arising from a lease are initially measured at the present value. 
 
Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:- 
- 
- 
- 
-Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable 
Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate 
Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees 
The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and 
Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an 
option to terminate the leaseThe  lease  payments  are  discounted  using  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease  if  that  rate  can  be  readily 
determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, which is 
the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the 
funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.2425224INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION225INTRODUCTIONGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYMD&AOPERATION REVIEWAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION226CORE COMPETENCYAPPENDIXFINANCIAL SECTION

₩Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants. The Company discloses the fair value of each class of assets and 
liabilities in a way that permits it to be compared with its carrying amount at the end of each reporting period. 
The best evidence of fair value of financial instruments is quoted price in an active market.Fair value of cash is same as carrying amount. Carrying amount of demand deposit 
and settlement deposit is a reasonable approximation of fair value because these 
financial instruments do not have a fixed maturity and are receivable on demand. 
Fair value of general deposit is measured using Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) 
Model. 
  
Fair value of financial instruments that are quoted in an active market is determined 
using the quoted prices. If there is no quoted price, fair value is determined using   
external  professional  valuation  institutions.  The  institutions  use  one  or  more 
valuation techniques that are deemed appropriate considering the characteristics 
of the financial instruments among DCF Model, Imputed Market Value Model, Free 
Cash Flow to Equity Model, Dividend Discount Model, Risk Adjusted Discount Rate 
Method, and Net Asset Value Method. 
 
Fair value of exchange traded derivatives is determined using quoted price in an 
active market,    and fair value of OTC derivatives is determined using valuation 
techniques.  The  Company  uses  internally  developed  valuation  models  that  are 
widely  used  by  market  participants  to  determine  fair  value  of  plain  vanilla  OTC 
derivatives including options, interest rate swaps, and currency swaps, based on 
observable market parameters. However, some complex financial instruments are 
valued  using  appropriate  models  developed  from  generally  accepted  market 
valuation  models  including  the  Finite  Difference  Method  (“FDM”),  and  the 
MonteCarlo Simulation or valuation results from independent external professional 
valuation institution. 
 
Fair value of loans is determined using DCF model discounting the expected cash 
flows, which are contractual cash flows adjusted by the expected prepayment rate, 
at an appropriate discount rate. 
  
DCF model is used to determine the fair value of borrowings, but in the case of 
short-term maturity, carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value. 
 
Fair  value  is  determined  by  using  valuation  results  of  external  professional 
valuation institutions, which are calculated using market inputs. 
  
Carrying  amount  is  a  reasonable  approximation  of  fair  value  because  other 
financial assets and other financial liabilities are temporary accounts used for other 
various transactions and their maturities are relatively short or not defined.SecuritiesDerivativesLoans measured at

5.1.2 Fair value hierarchy 
 
The Company believes that valuation techniques used for measuring the fair value of financial instruments are 
reasonable and that the fair value recognized in the statements of financial position is appropriate. However, 
the fair value of the financial instruments recognized in the statements of financial position may be different if 
other valuation techniques or assumptions are used. Additionally, as there are a variety of valuation techniques 
and assumptions used in measuring fair value, it may be difficult to reasonably compare the fair value with that 
of other financial institutions. 
 
The Company classifies and discloses fair value of the financial instruments into the three fair value levels as 
follows: 
 
Level 1 :  The fair values are  based  on quoted  prices (unadjusted) in active markets for  identical assets orliabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.Level 2 :  The  fair  values  are  based  on  inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  included  within  Level  1  that  areobservable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.Level 3 :  The fair values are based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
 
The fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the 
lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. If an observable input requires an adjustment 
using an unobservable input and that adjustment results in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement, 
the resulting measurement would be categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Sensitivity analysis of financial instruments is performed to measure favorable and unfavorable changes in fair 
value of financial instruments which are affected by unobservable parameters, using a statistical technique. 
When the fair value is affected by more than one input parameter, the amounts represent the most favorable or 
most unfavorable outcome. There are hybrid securities whose fair value changes are recognized in profit or loss.

No deferred income tax assets have been recognized for the deductible temporary differences of ₩ 2,896,164 
million and ₩ 51,742 million associated with investments in subsidiaries and impairment losses on investments 
in subsidiaries, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, due to the uncertainty that these temporary differences

temporary differences of ₩ 18,490 million associated subordinated bond as of December 31, 2021, as they 
affect neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss) at the time of the transaction.

No deferred income tax liabilities have been recognized for the taxable temporary differences of ₩ 2,415,073 
million associated with investments in subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021, due to the following reasons:

The above sensitivity analysis is based  on  a change in  an  assumption while holding all  other  assumptions 
constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The 
sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in significant actuarial assumptions is calculated using 
the  same  projected  unit  credit  method  used  in  calculating  the  defined  benefit  obligation  recognized  in  the 
statement of financial position.

28.2 Diluted Earnings per Share 
 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated through increasing the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding by the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding 
assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Company has dilutive potential ordinary 
shares such as stock grants and ordinary share exchange right of exchangeable bonds. 
 
A calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined 
as the average market share price for the year) based on the monetary value of stock grants. The number of 
shares calculated above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the 
settlement of stock grants. 
 
Exchangeable bonds are included in potential ordinary shares from the exercisable date of the exchange right, 
and interest expense after tax for the period is added to profit for diluted earnings per share.7576250INTRODUCTIONMD&AGROUP REVIEWCORE COMPETENCYKB Financial Group Inc.

b) The proliferation of COVID-19 has had a negative impact on the global economy, which may have an impact 
on the expected credit losses and potential impairment of assets in a particular portfolio, and it could negatively 
affect the revenue generation capability of the Company as follows: 
 
–  There is a possibility of uncertainty about the credit risk of a borrower that could be affected by COVID-19. 
–  Uncertainty may arise about forward-looking macroeconomic information related to expected credit losses. 
–  Korean won may depreciate against major foreign currencies. This may result in an increase in principal 
and interest payments on liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, and losses on foreign exchange 
transactions.–  A significant decrease in the fair value of the Company's investment in an entity that could be affected bycommitments-    ₩COVID-19 pandemic can occur.2021December 31,2020₩608,076    ₩(3)23,084
