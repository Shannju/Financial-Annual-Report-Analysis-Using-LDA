financial innovation and broaden the scope of its business presence 
with an aim to secure sustainable future growth engines.Dear esteemed customers, shareholders and investors!I  would  like  to  extend  my  sincere  gratitude  to  our  customers  and  shareholders  for  the  steadfast  trust  and  support  you  have  
extended to the innovation and growth of KB Financial Group.Throughout the last year, due to an unprecedented magnitude of COVID 19 pandemic, economic uncertainties continued at home and abroad, 
bringing about lasting changes in our whole society and industry. Amid such a challenging environment, KB Financial Group focused greater 
efforts on strengthening competence in order to deliver customer happiness and help building a better world.We focused on KB Securities, KB Insurance, and KB Capital, previously acquired non-banking arm, securely anchoring their operations onto the 
group’s business platform by achieving synergies, and successfully acquired Prudential Life, further bolstering our business portfolio. Moreover, 
through the M&As in global business such as Prasac Microfinance Institution(“Prasac”) in Cambodia, and PT Bank Bukopin(“Bukopin”) in 
Indonesia, we have laid the foundation to develop well diversified and balanced business portfolio by expanding future revenue sources through.KB Financial Group also pushed forward various product and service innovation efforts with a top priority on customer convenience and 
interest. ‘KB Mobile Certification’, KB Kookmin Bank’s self-developed private authentication service for online banking, attracted more than 7.3 
million users within twenty months of its roll out, and KB Securities introduced ‘Prime Club service’, the industry’s first subscription-based asset 
management service. Furthermore, KB Insurance successfully approved ‘Simple online-application service for corporate’, from the Financial 
Services Commission as innovative financial services, simplifying the insurance registration process from three days to five minutes.Also noteworthy is our ramped-up efforts to overcome big tech, and fintech challenges in the competition for customer touch points. In order 
to more effectively penetrate the fast-growing payments market, we introduced KB Pay offering improved user experience and membership 
benefits. Also, to further sharpen our competitive edge in the MyData business, we upgraded our asset management practices and bolstered 
ties with our business partners.IntroductionCore CompetencyManagement’s Discussion & AnalysisOperation ReviewFinancial SectionAppendix009KB Financial Group has surpassed a KRW

coal policy, and conducting other ESG-related measures, we focused on laying the most 
proactive and exemplary ESG framework among the Korean financial groups, and solidified 
our distinctive leadership in ESG management.Now I would like to briefly review the Group’s 2020 business performances.Despite contraction in net interest margins due to sustained low rate environment and 
additional preemptive provision against COVID 19-related uncertainties, KB Financial Group 
improved its solid earnings fundamentals, posting a KRW 3,455.2 billion of net income, 
increased by KRW 143.4 billion from the previous year. Interest incomes increased on the back 
of growth in bank loans and M&As effect of Prudential Life and Prasac; fee & commission 
significantly expanded led by fee income of securities business with favorable stock markets; 
the capital market business improved its earnings performance; the consolidation effect from 
the acquisition of Prudential Life resulted in visible and promising outcomes.The Group’s total assets increased by KRW 92.1 trillion to KRW 610.7 trillion compared to a year 
ago, attributable to solid growth in loans on the back of balanced growth of household and 
corporate, the M&As conducted in 2020 including Prudential Life, Prasac, and Bukopin, and an 
hefty expansion of investments in securities with our efforts to diversify revenue sources.Such improved financial performances were made possible due mainly to the unwavering 
support of the customers and shareholders of KB Financial Group and of Group’s family 
members. Looking forward, all of us at KB Financial Group will do our best to present a leading 
financial group that makes progress by leaps and bound through an unrelenting pursuit of 
change and innovation.Over the past year, as the fears of the prolonged COVID 19 pandemic to grip the world, the 
global economy contracted, and the gap widened between the financial market and the real 
economy, bringing about continuous uncertainties in the economy. Also, as the domestic 
economy remained in the low growth and low rate vicious cycle, the so-called money shiftis taking flight, from savings to investment and from home to abroad, setting off a paradigm 
shift in the financial environment.Fourthly, through expansion and internalization of ESG management, we will establish a 
sustainable ESG system. (ESG Leadership)To better prepare for such an era and lead the finance of tomorrow, KB Financial Group has 
adopted ‘R.E.N.E.W. 2021’ as the growth strategy for the coming year and plans to channel its 
resources on the following directions.Firstly, we will revamp business models with our core competitive edge, and further solidify 
market positions. (Reinforce the Core)With the goals of being a solid No.1 in banking and a top-tier in non-banking, we will focus on 
making all subsidiaries more competitive in their areas of expertise and strengthening core income 
models by business, thereby securing more uniquely competitive and increasing income sources.Secondly, we will further bolster non-banking businesses and secure new growth engines by 
expanding global business territory, and strengthening the non-banking sector. (Expansion of 
Global & New Biz)Tweaking the Two-track strategy we have applied overseas for years, we will accelerate global 
expansions by further stabilizing the global business infrastructure, and facilitating more 
complete and efficient localization and closer cooperation among the subsidiaries. Also, we will 
secure new growth engines by further expanding into non-financial areas such as automobile, 
real estate, health care, and telecommunications.Thirdly, by embracing customer-centric digital innovation, we will grow into a No. 1 financial 
platform. (No. 1 Platform(Customer-Centric))Through the expansion of eco-friendly product lineups, investment and finance, we will boost 
our Green Leadership in the financial industry, and through establishment of ESG management 
systems and enhancements in risk management systems, we will lay a sustainable growth 
foundation and strengthen KB Financial Group’s role as a social safety net.Lastly, through Up-skill and Re-skill, we will establish a ‘World-class culture’ that is open and 
creative and breeds top talent. (World Class Talents & Culture)By accelerating the development and placement of talents in digital and core growth areas and 
fostering a mindset of sharing and collaboration that encourages creative ideas and collective 
intelligence, we will establish a creative and open corporate culture in which top talent can 
reach their potential.2021 is expected to be a momentous year where the fate of financial players will be decided in 
the coming financial market. As such, all of us at KB Financial Group will move forward, sharing 
and bringing together their individual strengths and intelligence to launch KB Financial Group 
on its journey toward becoming the most beloved No.1 financial platform company, a life-time 
financial partner.Looking forward to see your unwavering support continue also in the coming year, I wish you 
and your family very best health and happiness.Thank you.We plan to push ahead a customer-centric digital innovation on the Group’s core mobile 
applications such as KB Star Banking and Liiv Mate, developing the most beloved comprehensive

securing the stable income base, which was further improved by M&As including Prasac Microfinance and Prudential Life Insurance.Non-interest income reached at KRW 2,770 billion, a KRW 535 billion increase mainly driven by improvements in non-banking

happiness and well-being to our customers and society. Our lofty dream 
of helping the world change for the better is translated into management 
and strategies which are then executed, and the unity of our employees 
is taking root in the form of a pledge to the best possible customer 
satisfaction.VisionDriven by world-class talents and bold innovation,to become your trusted financial partner for a lifetimeKB Financial Group’s vision is ‘Driven by world-class talents and bold 
innovation, to become your trusted financial partner for a lifetime’. Armed 
with a like-minded group of world-class financial experts taking on daring 
innovation challenges and leading the paradigm of finance, KB Financial 
Group will grow into a financial group of a first choice among customers and 
growing with them as their lifetime financial partner.2020 Key AchievementsBalanced business portfolio
In 2020, KB Financial Group diversified income sources by bolstering the 
non-banking business portfolio and further solidified its market presence 
as a leading financial group. In August, 2020, by acquiring Prudential Life, 
Korea’s top-tier insurer in terms of capital adequacy, sales capabilities and 
financial stability, KB Financial Group strengthened its relatively frail life 
insurance business and put its non-banking and banking sides on a more 
balanced footing, thereby bolstering the overall competitiveness of its 
business portfolio.Sustainable growth drivers secured 
KB Financial Group strengthened its global business through M&A and 
channel expansion by going beyond the domestic market nearing the 
saturation point to overseas: Through its subsidiaries, KB Financial Group 
acquired Prasac Microfinance Institution in Cambodia, PT Bank Bukopin 
in Indonesia and other overseas businesses, and by signing a strategic 
alliance with the Carlyle Group, evidenced its presence as a leading 
financial group and shored up its sustainability potential.Innovative products and services with top priority on 
customer convenience
KB Financial Group continues to develop innovative products and services 
placing top priority on customer convenience and interest. KB Kookmin 
Bank introduced ‘KB Mobile Certification’, an self-developed private 
authentication service, attracted more than 7.3 million users within 20 
months of its roll out ; KB Securities introduced ‘Prime Club Service’, the 
industry’s first subscription-based asset management service; and KB 
Insurance’s ‘Simple Online Application Service for Corporate’ was selected 
as Innovative Financial Service by the Financial Services Commission.Integrated financial platform upgraded
KB Financial Group bolstered its effort to secure a leadership in the 
competition for customer contact points against big tech and fintech 
players. To get a stronger grip on the fast-growing mobile payments 
market, the Group introduced ‘KB Pay’ with improved usability and 
a membership functionality; and to secure a competitive advantage 
in a data economy on the heels of MyData business, upgraded asset 
management practices and strengthened fintech ties.ESG leadership secured
In March 2020, KB Financial Group established an ESG Committee under 
the board of directors and adopted ‘KB Green Way 2030’, an ESG strategy 
that aims to reduce carbon emissions by 25% of the 2017 level and 
to increase ESG-related products, investments and loans to a total of 
KRW 50 trillion by 2030. Also adopting a ‘Anti-coal policy’ in Sept. 2020, 
across Group and its subsidiaries, an industry first, and becoming the only 
recipient of the top grade in Korea Corporate Governance Service’s 2020 
ESG evaluation, we further solidified our position as the industry’s leader 
in ESG management.Management Goals for 2021Top-tier Player with Innovative Financial PlatformsWith the COVID 19 pandemic still gripping the world, the global economy 
remains contracted, widening the gap between the financial market and 
real economy. On the domestic front, with the low growth and low rate 
environment continuing, the paradigm of wealth management is changing, 
as money shift is taking flight, from savings to investment and from Korea 
to overseas.To  better  prepare  for  such  era  and  lead  the  finance  of  tomorrow,  
KB Financial Group has adopted ‘R.E.N.E.W. 2021’ as the management 
strategy for 2021 and plans to focus its resources on five tasks the 
acronym represents as follows:Reinforce the Core 
Firstly,  we  will  revamp  business  models  and  further  solidify  market 
positions by ‘Reinforcing the Core’.
With the goals of being a solid No.1 in banking and top-tier in non-
banking, we will focus on making all subsidiaries more competitive in their 
areas of expertise and strengthening core income models by business, 
thereby being more uniquely competitive and increasing income sources.Expansion of Global & New Biz 
Secondly, by ‘expanding global and new business’, we will further bolster 
non-banking operations and secure new growth engines.
By tweaking the two-track strategy we’ve applied overseas for years, we 
will further stabilize the global business infrastructure, and by facilitating 
more complete and efficient localization among subsidiaries operating in 
the same country, we will accelerate global expansions. Also, by further 
expanding into non-financial areas such as automobile, real estate, health 
care, telecommunications, we will secure new growth engines.No.1 Platform(Customer-Centric)
Thirdly, by embracing customer-centric digital technologies, we will grow 
into a solid No. 1 financial platform brand.By  upgrading  leading  financial  apps  with  the  latest  in  digital 
technology, we will develop the most comprehensive financial services 
platform  offering  data-based  one-stop  financial  solutions,  while  
developing  customer  management  systems  that  seamlessly  and  
organically connect non-face-to-face channels.ESG Leadership
Fourthly, through expansion and internalization of ESG management, we 
will establish a sustainable ESG leadership.
Through expansion of product lineups, investment and finance, we will boost 
our green leadership in the financial industry, and through establishment of 
ESG management systems and upgrading of risk management systems, we 
will lay a sustainable growth foundation and strengthen KB’s position as a 
eco-friendly company and role as a social safety net.World Class Talents & Culture
Lastly, through up-skill and re-skill, we will establish a ‘World-class culture’ 
that is open and creative and breeds top talent. 
By accelerating the development and placement of talent in digital  
and  core-growth  areas  and  fostering  a  mindset  of  sharing  and  
collaboration that encourages creative ideas and collective intelligence, 
we will establish a creative and open corporate culture in which top talent 
can reach their potential.2021 Management Goals & StrategiesR.E.N.E.W. 2021Reinforce the CoreExpansion ofGlobal & New BizNo. 1 Platform

The board of directors (“the BoD”) of KB Financial Group serves as 
the supreme decision-making body to deliberate on and decide major 
management issues of the Group and other subsidiaries and to hold top 
management accountable.The Chairman and CEO of KB Financial Group is appointed at the general 
shareholder meeting as stipulated in the Articles of Incorporation. 
Candidates for this position are selected and their qualifications are 
examined in accordance with the rules and regulations set forth by the 
CEO Nominating Committee, which is composed solely of non-executive 
directors, prior to their nomination to the general shareholder meeting.At KB Financial Group, the BoD has defined ‘shareholder representation, 
professionalism, and diversity’ as the core principles in the appointment 
of non-executive directors. As such, a pool of non-executive director 
candidates is managed year-round in the seven fields of financial 
business, management, accounting, finance & risk management, law 
& regulation, digital& IT, ESG & consumer protection. The process of 
candidates nomination consists of the three steps of candidate pooling, 
evaluation and nomination, which are operated in complete isolation 
to ensure the independence and fairness of the process. The candidate 
pool is regularly managed on a semi-annual basis and is created based 
on recommendations of shareholders and external search firms. Notably, 
any shareholder who owns one or more shares of KB Financial Group 
can recommend candidates and KB Financial Group institutes such a 
practice for the first time in Korean financial industry. Furthermore, 
external advisory panels participate in this process to ensure objectivity 
in assessing candidates’ qualifications and the results are used, along 
with reference checks, to have final candidates selected by the Non-
Executive Director Nominating Committee.These candidates are evaluated for their qualifications at the committee 
meeting in accordance with the criteria set by relevant regulations andCORPORATE GOVERNANCE GOALSecuring Independence of

expertise of its BoD candidates. Also, as a way to ensure the expertise 
and diversity of the BoD, we manage the candidate pool in the seven

to the rapidly-shifting financial landscape in an effort to efficiently support its mid to long-term strategy and business decision-making.IntroductionCore CompetencyManagement’s Discussion & AnalysisOperation ReviewFinancial SectionAppendix018Risk Governance
Risk Management Committee is mandated to set risk management 
strategies, determine acceptable levels of risk appetite, review the status 
of group-wide risk management, and approve the application of risk 
management systems, methodologies and major improvements.Risk Management Council consists of risk management officers from 
the holding company and subsidiaries, and is responsible for deliberating 
on the matters delegated by the Risk Management Committee and 
consulting on detailed risk management issues.The risk management department of the holding company monitors 
and manages the status of group-wide risk operations and the limits of 
internal capital by developing risk management policies and operating 
relevant processes.Credit Risk Management
KB Financial Group defines credit risks as expected and unexpected losses 
that may occur due to the default or declining creditworthiness of the 
counterparty.•  Credit Policy Direction : KB Financial Group develops credit policies in 
consideration of economic outlooks, business conditions, asset quality 
trends, and risk management capabilities, and accordingly operates 
sector-specific loan policies in the household, corporate, and credit 
card sectors. The primary goal of our credit policy is to maintain asset 
quality and minimize mid to long-term credit cost volatility in order to 
maximize the value of KB Financial Group.•  Credit Risk Measurement & Management : To measure credit risks  
related to capital at risk, or CaR, concerning on/off balance sheet assets, 
KB Financial Group takes the internal ratings based approach developedGroup Risk Governance·  Set risk appetite & internal capital limitsDevelop group-level risk policies·   Consult on the matters delegated by the RiskManagement Committee and pending risk 
management issuesKB Kookmin BankKB SecuritiesKB InsuranceKB Kookmin CardPrudential Life InsuranceKB Asset ManagementKB CapitalKB Life InsuranceKB Real Estate TrustKB Savings BankKB InvestmentKB Data SystemsKB Credit Informationin compliance with supervisory standards. CaR thus calculated refers to 
the maximum possible losses from business operations that may arise 
at a certain confidence level due to changes in creditworthiness of the 
borrower or counterparty. Our CaR calculations reflect all possibilities of 
insolvency on the part of the borrower, possible losses and remaining 
maturity of exposure, and economic correlations. Furthermore, we 
identify, measure and monitor credit concentration risks that may 
additionally occur due to disproportionate allocations of credit on 
specific borrowers or sectors in the portfolio.•  Total Exposure Limit Management : KB Financial Group employs a ‘total 
exposure limit management system’ to prevent excessive risk exposure 
and risk concentration in specific sectors and to optimize the credit 
portfolio through stable asset management. The risk management 
department of the holding company is responsible for periodically 
monitoring the group’s total exposure limit and reporting related 
outcomes to the Risk Management Committee.Market Risk Management
KB Financial Group defines market risks as possible losses from its trading 
positions with respect to interest rates, exchange rates, stock prices and 
other market fluctuations, and identifies, measures, monitors, controls and 
reports such market risks inherent in bonds, foreign currencies, securities, 
and derivatives. Serving as an indicator to quantify risks inherent in trading 
accounts, Market VaR(Value at Risk) refers to the maximum possible losses 
that may occur within a certain period of time at a certain confidence 
level. KB subsidiaries managing trading accounts verify the adequacy of 
our VaR model through a daily comparative analysis performed on actual 
and virtual profits/losses and VaR calculations. For assets or subsidiaries to 
which this model is not applicable, we utilize our standard methodology in 
compliance with supervisory regulations to manage market risks.Interest Rate Risk Management
Defined as possible decreases in net asset value or net interest income(NII) 
attributable to unfavorable fluctuations in market rates, interest rate 
risks are managed to maximize net interest income within an acceptable 
risk range as well as to minimize any losses from narrowing net interest 
margins following falling interest rates.Liquidity Risk Management
Defined as risks that may arise due to maturity mismatches or any failures 
to respond to an unexpected need for or lack of funding, liquidity risks to 
which the Group is exposed are managed through a systemic approach 
focused on meeting such needs for liquidity as deposit withdrawals, 
maturing financial bonds, and repayments of borrowings as well as on 
securing liquidity for asset management including lending and bond 
investment.Operational Risk Management
Defined  as  any  and  all  financial  and  non-financial  risks  that  may 
negatively impact capital operations, operational risks facing the Group 
are managed with an aim to satisfy the regulatory requirements of 
supervising authorities and to disseminate a risk management culture 
across all operations through strengthening of internal controls and 
process improvement.Internal Capital Management
Internal capital is required to prevent an economic insolvency related 
to unexpected losses at the target confidence level. KB Financial Group 
manages group-wide capital adequacy by measuring, allocating, and 
managing the internal capital of its subsidiaries. The Risk Management 
Committee defines a risk tolerance level and then allocates internal capital 
by risk type and subsidiary while each subsidiary conducts business within 
the allocated capital limit.Stress Testing
Stress tests are performed to analyze the potential vulnerabilities of asset 
and investment portfolio and develop countermeasures accordingly under 
possible scenarios created based on economic forecasts. KB Financial 
Group conducts such tests at least semi-annually by reflecting economic 
cycles and prospects to analyze how its operations may be impacted by 
abrupt changes across the business landscape and to respond to them 
proactively. Test results are reported to top management and the Risk 
Management Committee to help set group-wide risk tolerance and limits 
and promote the decision-making process.IntroductionCore CompetencyManagement’s Discussion & AnalysisOperation ReviewFinancial SectionAppendix019Basel III-based Approach for Group Credit Risk Management
Following the introduction of the Basel III framework by the Korean 
Financial Services Commission, KB Financial Group has fully developed 
necessary infrastructure to address subsequent regulatory changes and 
has been applying the Basel standards to calculating risk-weighted assets 
and capital adequacy ratios since 2013.To elevate the rigor of risk management across all business operations, we 
developed a single model-based Internal Ratings Based Approach in 2016, 
which was thoroughly vetted by the Financial Supervisory Services, and has 
since been using it to calculate BIS ratios.KB Financial Group and KB Kookmin Bank, in particular, both have gained 
approval from the Financial Supervisory Service on their methodology for 
calculating risk-weighted assets, as allowed in ‘Basel III: Finalizing post-
crisis reforms’.Through an internal classification of credit risks inherent in our business 
operations, we will not only improve capital adequacy but also advance 
risk management practices, systems and structure, and in the process, 
foster a risk management culture. We expect these and other related 
efforts to contribute to enhance our overall business soundness as well as 
high value of credit worthiness.2021 Risk Management Direction
The global economy, which briefly faced a crisis of a scale similar to that 
of the Great Depression in 2020, is showing signs of stability, particularly 
in  the  financial  market,  as  globally  governments  have  taken  swift 
countermeasures based on their experiences in handling past crises of 
similar magnitudes. The Korean economy expected to recover relatively 
at a fast pace; and in the long run, to adjust the pace to that of the global 
economy due to the nature of its open yet limited scale.Considering that potential risks underlying such situations at home and 
abroad as aforementioned can rise above and damage the soundness and 
profitability of financial institutions, KB Financial Group is focusing on ways 
to manage such risks. In order to maintain asset quality of each subsidiary 
at the highest possible level, we will strengthen the monitoring of all risks 
associated with its business operations, while promoting the proactive 
risk management of subsidiaries concerning volatility in interest rates, 
exchange rates, stock prices and other market factors to fully address 
market uncertainties. Also we will monitor and preemptively manage the 
risk facing in the overseas advances.Emerging Risk Management
KB Financial Group has been identifying risks emerging anew through economic, environmental and social changes that can significantly affect its operations in the long run and proactively, taking 
counter-measures against such risks. In particular, identifying such changes triggered by falling birth rates and an aging population as well as in the work process brought about by digital finance 
innovations as key emerging risks, KB Financial Group has defined their characteristics, potential long-term impacts on business and respective counter-measures as follows:Demographic changes related 
to low birth rates and aging 
population
Such demographic changes are expected to 
lower savings and reduce the economic activity 
of older borrowers, bringing about income 
reductions and deterioration in asset qualityWork process changes following 
digital finance innovation
Despite innovation-based growth opportunities 
available for financial institutions, the risk 
resulted from ineffectively responding to such 
business opportunities, data protection, data 
protection and it related risk can wreck havoc 
on the industry as a wholeEnvironmental, social responsibility 
and governance (ESG) issues 
The risk of business plans and actions not in 
step with regulations or market demands from 
the prospective of ESGAccording  to  analysis  of  the  asset  quality  of 
household by age of the borrowers, as ages go 
up, the credit quality of the borrower gets more 
deteriorated.As  the  average  age  of  borrowers  in  the  KB  credit 
portfolio is expected to move up through the increasingly 
diminishing  income  brackets,  credit  management 
guidelines and other measures will be employed that take 
into consideration borrowers’ expected income and debt

based on digital finance innovation are changing 
business modes across the industry value chain, 
creating opportunities for new products, services 
and business modelsIn preparation for emerging risks based on digital finance 
innovation, KB is actively accessing and developing 
measures against their potential impacts, applying big 
data, machine learning, and other new technology-
based methodologies to risk managementGlobal investors increasingly base their investment 
decisions  on  the  individual  corporate  handling 
of ESG issues. Also, carbon emissions reduction 
and other toughening regulatory measures can

KB Financial Group continues to strengthen its dominance on customer contact points by bolstering its financial platforms and to focus more resources 
and energy on its digital transformation.In 2020, KB Financial Group strengthened the quality management 
of its platforms, rolled out the industry’s first self-developed private 
authentication service, devised MyData business strategies, and bolstered 
core operation capabilities for digital acceleration. In 2021, we will focus 
on offering convenient yet value-packed services with top priority on 
customer interests.Facing a pandemic-induced era of untact, KB Financial Group focused

experience improvement
KB Financial Group has significantly enhanced the capabilities and user 
convenience for our key platforms, including KB Star Banking, Liiv Mate 
and M-able, conducting quality insurance process and developing UI/UX 
focused on customer experience, to solidify the market dominance. Going 
though a cloud-based open infrastructure conversion and chatbot-based 
banking service, Liiv Mate of KB Kookmin Card is slated to prepare for a 
quantum transition into an AI-based platform. We also expanded the scale 
of their respective digital financial services: KB Kookmin Bank launched ‘Liiv 
Real Estate’, a real estate platform where customers can view properties 
on sale and apply for a loan, accumulating real estate data and related 
financial data onto the one platform; ‘KB Cha Cha Cha’ of KB Capital, a 
used car trading platform with Korea’s largest listing in terms of registeredKB Star Banking MAU (In millions)for sale; and KB Savings Bank rolled out ‘KiwiBank’, that enables account 
open, deposit, borrowing, and other banking transactions all year round, 
24 hours a day.Responding to market and regulatory changes
In response to fintech firms entering financial services business on the 
back of supporting government policies favorable to digital banking, 
we sought to build a financial platform that is the easiest and most 
convenient for customers, based on the one-stop financial service and 
consulting know-how it has accumulated. Based on ‘The K Project’, a 
next-generation system launched in October, 2020, we plans to fully 
integrate the branches, mobile and internet banking, call centers and other 
channels in an effort to enable customers to experience the seamless 
service of consistent quality regardless of which channel they use.Also in response to revision of the Electronic Signature Act in December 
2020, KB Kookmin Bank introduced the industry’s first self-developed 
private authentication service in July 2019. ‘KB Mobile Certification’ 
enables its users to conduct financial transactions through all the group 
mobile platforms, from membership sign up to subscription to financial 
product; once signed in, customers are automatically logged in onto the 
10 platforms of our major six subsidiaries. For its outstanding functionality, 
the authentication program attracted 7.3 million users in 20 months 
of its roll out, playing a crucial role in the expansion of group business 
area: KB Kookmin Bank is the only financial institution among the five 
private companies selected to participate in the government’s digital 
authentication pilot project, and KB Mobile Certification is gradually 
applying to of the public service including home tax service of National 
Tax Service, Government 24, etc.With the emergence of the MyData service enabling comprehensive data 
analysis, KB Financial Group sought to apply its wide collection of diverse 
customer data to various ends, including developing personalized products 
and services as well as new customers. For subsidiaries, MyData strategies 
were formulated and fine-tuned to the characteristics of their business 
operations; and for the Group as a whole, strategies were developed to 
expand internal and external MyData collections with a focus on banking 
and credit card business. KB Kookmin Card launched ‘Liiv Mate 3.0’ on an

Bolstering core competencies to spur digital transformation
In 2020, KB Financial Group recorded a labor saving effect of 1.93 
million work hours owing mainly to its adoption of Robotic Process 
Automation(RPA)  through  which  a  large  portion  of  day-to-day 
operations was automated and significant business opportunities were 
developed.‘KB DNA’ was launched with an aim to improve communication with 
college and university students. Through this digital communication 
program, we reached out and formed a partnership with a college 
IT startup club, and by listening to their opinions about its mobile 
platforms, identified 25 things to remedy and reflected subsequent 
improvements in the following UI/UX upgrade.Building KB-centered digital ecosystems through external 
collaboration
Through ‘KB Innovation HUB’, the program developed to support high 
growth-potential startups, we continued to match promising fintech 
firms with subsidiaries, nominating 111 firms as ‘KB Starters’, forming 
147 cases of alliance, and investing an aggregated KRW 52.3 billion in 
the firms by growth stage, as of the end of 2020. Also in July 2020, to 
help startups focus more on innovative service development on their 
own while freely networking with subsidiaries, the we relocated, and

finite resources, we now are pushing forward a 2nd Mother Market strategy 
focusing on a few target countries as operation bases.In September, 2020, KB Kookmin Bank acquired a 67% equity stake in PT 
Bank Bukopin in Indonesia and added it as a subsidiary. The acquisition is 
meaningful in that it marks the Group’s smooth entry into a high growth 
potential. The acquisition highlights the Group’s unique global business 
approach in contrast to that of peers, taking over smaller banks as a 
stepping stone and pursuing organic growth.KB Kookmin Bank also acquired a 70% stake in Prasac Microfinance in 
April, 2020. Boasting a branch network of over 180 branches Cambodia’s 
largest micro deposit-taking institution(MDI) ranks No.3 in credit market 
share among the local financial companies, including commercial banks.

commercial bank and grow it into a solid financial base from which to secure 
a position of advantage in the race dubbed ‘New Southeast Expansion’.KB Kookmin Bank also made history in Myanmar by being the first foreign 
bank to establish a local subsidiary: After nine months of preparation, the 
Bank was given a green light in December, 2020, from Myanmar financial 
authorities to set up a subsidiary. Once established, the subsidiary can open 
up to 10 branches and engage in corporate and retail banking anywhere 
in the natural resource-rich country. We plan to grow its subsidiary into a 
small yet sound foreign bank.Also in the same month, KB Securities launched ‘KB FINA Joint Stock 
Company in Vietnam, nurturing a fintech-based joint venture with G-Group,

establishing ESG governance across its operations. To better respond to ESG-related issues, KB Financial Group has established an ESG Committee 
comprising all of the board of directors an industry’s first.Leading ESG management through ESG governance establishment
In January 2020, KB Financial Group declared ‘The Principles for ESG Execution’ 
as a follow-up to the direction set for ESG strategies in September 2019 and 
established an ESG Committee within the board of directors and set up ESG 
strategies in March 2020 thereby completing an ESG management structure.Also set up, in August, was ‘KB Green Way 2030’, a mid to long-term roadmap 
for ESG management. By 2030, we plan to reduce carbon emissions by 25% from 
2017 and to increase the value of ESG-related products, investments and loans 
to KRW 50 trillion.To achieve these goals, KB Financial Group has defined as three ESG strategic 
tasks 1) advancing climate change strategy to protect the environment, 2) 
internalizing responsible management for society, and 3) spreading the culture of 
transparent governance. The focus areas are also selected for all tasks and steps 
are being taken to implement the tasks. In particular, to advance climate change 
strategy for our environment, KB Financial Group declared to adopt the Equator 
Principles in August 2020, and joined in February 2021.In September 2020, to proactively respond to climate change,we declared its 
pledge to phase out coal financing. True to its anti-coal policy pledge, we have 
stopped financing as well as underwriting new projects involving coal power 
generation at home and abroad.Bolstering partnerships by taking an active part in global 
initiatives
KB Financial Group is leading a ‘Green Initiatives’ through participation in global 
initiatives and NGO activities. It had joined TCFD (Task force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosure) in 2018 as a supporting institution, and based on TCFD 
recommendations, has been sharing with stakeholders its efforts concerning 
climate change risks.In addition, KB Kookmin Bank, also taking part in the Equator Principles movement

their environmental impacts, has joined the working groups of the Principles for 
Responsible Banking and the Collective Commitment to Climate Action.KB Financial Group also participates in the UN Global Compact, the CarbonDisclosure Project, and other sustainable management-related global initiatives. To

review, we are taking part in developing banking guidelines for UNEP FI and the 
EU Taxonomy, fulfilling our responsibility as an ESG leader. As part of our support

business areas with a focus on eco-friendly factors, while continuing to invest 
in business and projects related to private funded eco-conscious development, 
new renewable energy generation, eco-friendly shipbuilding and auto. In fact, 
KB Financial Group dominates the industry when it comes to such large-scale 
renewable energy source development projects as solar, wind and battery bank 
power generation, taking an active part in the whole process, from finance 
consulting to investment arrangement. KB Financial Group is financing various 
large scale of renewable energy generation projects in Korea, including Solaseado 
Solar Power Generation and ESS project in Haenam and KB Muan Sunlight Power 
Plant. Also, by actively participating in and financing public housing and urban 
remodeling projects, we lead the industry in addressing acute social issues.KB Financial Group also is increasing financing support for the growth of eco-
friendly projects as well as green industry through such eco-themed products as 
‘KB Green Growth Loan’ offering discounted rates to green growth companies 
with  preferred  rates  while  donating  a  portion  of  profits  to  green  growth 
associations, ‘Preferential Loans for PV Power Plant Businesses’ developed 
exclusively for customers engaging in solar power generation business. Through 
support channels for small business owners and low-income classes, we offered 
financial services developed for the socially and economically venerable trapped 
in the financial blind spot. In particular, for small-business owners hit hard by 
the COVID 19 pandemic, we supported liquidity through ‘KB Corona Special 
Guarantee Agreement Loan’ and ‘KB Small Business Secondary Protection 
Program Agreement Loan’. Also, by supporting vulnerable customers in link with 
more inclusive subsidiaries, the Group was able to prevent people with low credit 
scores from being pushed into the jaws of predatory lending, thereby playing the 
role of a social safety net.KB Financial Group also issues and offers diverse sustainability bonds to expand 
its finance support for eco-friendly and socially conscious projects. KB Kookmin

investor returns
KB Financial Group applies to six major subsidiaries the Stewardship Code, a strict 
guideline for institutional investors to follow in their engagement in corporate 
governance in the interests of their beneficiaries. By adopting the code and thus 
reflecting ESG as well as financial considerations in its pursuit of higher corporate 
value, we facilitate the growth of its investee companies and at the same time, 
strengthens a sense of responsibility among its investment managers to grow 
customer assets in the mid to long run.Also, KB Financial Group has in place systems for preventing conflicts of interest

expectations of key stakeholder segments as follows: making social contributions 
toward creating value for future generations; seeking mutual growth through 
expansion of social values; strengthening the respect for stakeholders’ human 
rights  and  diversity;  supplying  stable  financial  services  for  the  financially 
marginalized and increasing funding support, thus faithfully carrying out its 
responsibility as a social network.Spreading the culture of transparent governance

adoption of the stewardship code is spreading at home and abroad. In response, 
we will continue such efforts to further expand its transparent and exemplary 
governance as follows: spread the importance of healthy governance through 
improvement of transparency in governance; increase the value of investees 
through active enforcement of the stewardship code; increase sustainable 
values through product sales and investment in businesses outstanding in

and creating social value, creating jobs for youths, promoting shared value with local communities, serving the environment and other related 
activities in link with the UN SDGs initiatives.In 2020, in response to the COVID 19 pandemic and to overcome the subsequent 
national crisis, the Group conducted all-directional social contribution activities, 
offering opportunities equal for education and experience opportunities to 
children and youths so that future leaders can follow their dreams with high 
hope, and playing diverse supporting roles in job creation, community services, 
environment preservation and other areas in dire need of support. The Group’s 
all social responsibility activity is conducted on the basis of the CSR program, 
while each subsidiary of KB Financial Group conducts strategic social contribution 
activities reflecting on the basis of group-wide core business areas.Fostering Future Generation 
Supporting child and youth growth bases
Since establishment of KB Financial Group in 2008, We have been conducting 
social contribution activities focused on laying the bases that enable children 
and youth to grow into sound-minded social members. Also by supporting 
multicultural family members, it stays in the forefront of building a society that 
embraces diversity and inclusiveness.To help solve the problem of dwindling child care services, a social issue continuing 
to pose a threat to the growth of future generations, the Group has been funding 
the building of children after care classrooms at elementary schools nationwide, 
as well as the construction and expansion of public kindergartens, since its signing 
of an agreement with the Ministry of Education in 2018; as of the end of 2020, 
cumulate funding amounted to KRW 75.0 billion. For the Group’s continued 
support, not only thousands of children in kindergarten and grade school are under 
the care of qualified and experienced guardians, but also many parents who had to 
sacrifice their career to take care of their children have been able to return to their 
jobs or create new jobs related to the operation of after-school care classrooms 
or the kindergartens. Such and other ripple effects of the Group’s contributions 
are expected to grow at an accelerating pace. As of the end of 2020, a total of 
1,446 classrooms in 894 schools were created with support of KB Financial Group. 
We plan to expand to approximately 2,500 classrooms by 2022, which will bring 
benefits to over 50,000 children.Korean language education is another area we continue to support as Korean fluency 
is essential for multicultural families to blend into their local communities. Also we 
supported diverse programs that offer jobs and related training to multicultural 
families. In particular, ‘Diverse Culture Classroom’ is gaining media attention as a KB’s 
unique program exemplary of its dedication to the promotion of diversity and social 
harmony, as it brings together children of diverse cultures, to help them understand 
one another’s cultures and thus discover that they have more in common than 
expected. Also, for children of North Korean defectors, we support school facilities 
and programs dedicated to helping such children recover their identity, adapt to their 
new environment, and grow as healthy Koreans in mind and body.Group CSR PolicyKB Financial Group set two over-arching directions of its CSR policies as ‘Fostering future generation’ and ‘Creating greater social value’, and these 
initiatives are focused on the areas of ‘youth & multicultural families’, ‘jobs’, ‘community investment’ and ‘environment’ in alignment with UN’s Sustainable 
Development Goals(SDGs).Fostering

been running diverse economic and finance education programs, which have become 
a key CSR project. By experimenting with diverse content and methods in step with 
social changes, we are presenting a new direction for economic and finance education.The KB Foundation has launched a team of lectures specializing in economic 
and finance education, dispatching them to schools, military bases, cultural 
centers and other institutions when requested as well as running diverse forms 
of education, including camp and invitation-only. In particular, meeting growing 
needs for contactless education amid an unprecedented pandemic, the foundation 
constructed ‘KB Star*D’, an economic and finance education experience center, 
with an eye toward being a leader in custom economic and finance education for 
younger generations. In 2020, the foundation educated some 126,000 people on 
economics and finance.Social Value Creation
Helping solve social issues and supporting the growth of local 
communities
In the second half of 2020, we provided SMEs and small-business owners suffering 
COVID 19-induced downturns with comprehensive financial support such as urgent 
working capital and deferrals of insurance premium and credit card payments. Also, 
masks, hand sanitizers, thermometers and other PPEs were donated to some 1,900 
community children’s centers and some 300 senior welfare facilities.In particular, KB Kookmin Bank supplied USIM cards for Liiv M, a finance and 
telecommunication hybrid  service  to  quarantined  overseas Koreans under 
COVID 19 lockdowns, reduced phone bills for customers living in the Daegu and 
Kyeongbuk regions, supported reducing bills for Internet and telecommunication 
services for an online schooling of elementary, middle and high school students.IntroductionCore CompetencyManagement’s Discussion & AnalysisOperation ReviewFinancial SectionAppendix027KB Good Jobs18,650 jobsJob fair attracted 560,000 visitors in

investment and most active collaboration among domestic fintech labs.KB Financial Group has operated ‘KB Good Jobs’ for the past 10 years, connecting 
quality  jobs  with  future  talent.  The program provides diverse employment 
information through its  website and, by offering resume  writing, interview

land at jobs that fit their career goals. In 2020, over 65,000 cases of employment 
information were provided, and ‘KB Good Jobs’ was held with the participation of 
blue-chip SMEs as well as job seekers. As of the end of 2020, attracted 560,000 
in cumulative number of visitors and landed some 18,650 jobs, thereby growinginto Korea’s largest job fair. In particular, financial incentives were provided 
to participating companies that had hired job seekers during the job fair and 
maintained the employment contracts for a certain period, thereby contributing to 
the stability of the newly created jobs. In addition, through ‘KB Good Job Academy’, 
‘KB Good Job School’, and other related programs, KB Financial Group stays in 
the forefront of improving young people’s odds of finding jobs in an increasingly 
competitive employment environment.As solving the rising environmental issues of late requires the combined effort 
of the nation, businesses and the people, we lead peers in socially responsible 
management through diverse eco-friendly social contribution activities. In the 
Mongolian region, the source of yellow dust and fine dust, ‘KB Kookmin Bank 
Forests’ are created to help reduce the centuries-old air pollution problem; and 
for children susceptible to the effects of yellow dust, air purifiers are donated to 
local children centers nationwide; to raise environmental awareness among youth,

conscious financial products are encouraged to participate. ‘KB Clear Sky’ and ‘KB 
Clean Ocean’, the industry’s first public-interest financial products through which 
customers can volunteer to help reduce fine dust and restore marine ecosystems, 
were launched back to back in 2020, as one of the our contributions to realize 
sustainable society through environment preservation for future generations.KB Kookmin Bank supported medical services for foreign workers in Korea and

rapidly  contracted  with  high  volatility  for  the  financial  market  as  well. 
Despite such challenges surrounding its business environment, KB Financial 
Group achieved meaningful results in 2020. By acquiring Prudential Life as 
a subsidiary, KB Financial Group further fortified the base of its business 
portfolio, gaining a meaningful market position in the life insurance business. 
Moreover, KB Financial Group also made substantial progress in global business, 
acquiring Prasac Microfinance Institution(“Prasac”) in Cambodia, and PT Bank 
Bukopin(“Bukopin”) in Indonesia, and further enhanced its sustainability.To review KB Financial Group’s business results for 2020, group net profit 
amounted to KRW 3,455 billion, up KRW 143 billion year on year, exceeding a 
KRW 3 trillion mark for four consecutive years, while EPS rose 4.2% over the 
course of 2020 to KRW 8,809. Though ROE dipped slightly to 8.79%, mainly 
due to the preemptive provisioning against COVID 19 related uncertainties and 
a large-scale of ERP cost, ROE on a recurring basis, stood at 10.17%, proving 
a sound earnings fundamental even in a difficult business environment with 
unprecedented challenges.Group net interest income rose by KRW 525 billion or 5.7%, to KRW 9,722 
billion on the strength of the solid growth of quality loan and profit-focused 
rebalancing of loan portfolio, despite contraction in net interest margin(NIM) 
following a 75bp of the Bank of Korea rate cut. Group non-interest income rose 
by KRW 535 billion or 23.9%, to KRW 2,770 billion mainly driven by a significant 
increase in fee and commission income across the non-banking subsidiaries. 
Brokerage fees expanded owing to increased stock trade volumes and effective 
sales strategies, and credit card fees expanded with strengthened marketing 
and cost savings efforts. As a result of the balanced growth of core income of 
banking and non-banking operations, the gross operating income reached KRW 
12,493 billion in 2020, up by 9.3% year on year.As  for  the  expenses  side,  Group  G&A  expenses  rose  by  KRW  565 
billion  or  9.0%,  to  KRW  6,833  billion.  It  was  primary  attributable  to  the 
increased  ERP  cost  and  M&A  effects  related  to  Prudential  Life,  Prasac, 
Bukopin  and  other  overseas  acquisitions  carried  out  in  2020.  Excluding 
these  factors,  G&A  expenses  on  a  recurring  basis  remained  within  a 
manageable  range.  Group  provision  for  credit  losses  amounted  to  KRW 
1,043 billion, up by KRW 373 billion or 55.7%. It was mainly attributable 
to  the  preemptive  provisioning  against  COVID  19,  amounting  toKRW 377 billion in 2020, excluding such preemptive provisioning, provisioning 
for credit losses remained flat. Group credit cost recorded 0.26%, but excluding 
such preemptive provisioning, credit cost stood at just 0.20% level.In asset quality, group NPL ratio(based on simple arithmetic sum of each domestic 
subsidiaries), fell by 0.08%p to 0.41% over the year, while NPL coverage ratio 
posted 168.6%, up by 21.5%p, proving solid asset quality to absorb losses against 
economic headwinds going forward.Group BIS and CET1 ratios under Basel III recorded 15.28% and 13.30%, 
respectively, maintained the industry’s top tier position on the back of solid 
earnings generation and strategic capital management including issuance of 
supplementary capital, despite increase in the risk weighted asset following loan 
growth.Key Financial IndicatorsROA

KB Financial Group’s total assets amounted to KRW 610.7 trillion as of the end 
of 2020, increased by KRW 92.2 trillion or 17.8%, primarily attributable to solid 
growth in loans of the bank and M&A effect such as Prudential Life and Prasac. 
Loans rose KRW 36.7 trillion to KRW 377.2 trillion, mainly driven by a balanced 
qualitative growth of household and corporate loans. Moreover, financial 
investments grew KRW 26.9 trillion on the back of the consolidation effectsof Prudential Life and the group-wide strategic moves to expand securities 
investments. Group AUM amounted to KRW 339.0 trillion, up by KRW 67.9 
trillion, as a result of KB Securities’ efforts to increase investor’s deposit as well 
as increase in AUM of KB Asset Management. Accordingly, the Group total 
assets including AUM amounted to KRW 940.4 trillion, up by KRW 150.6 trillion

KB Financial Group’s net profit for 2020 amounted to KRW 3,455 billion, up by 
4.3% year on year. Notwithstanding challenges and uncertainties surrounding 
business environment, we saw a balanced improved earnings fundamental 
across banking and non-banking business. Net interest income firmly increased 
driven by solid loan growth, despite NIM contraction following sustained low 
rate environment, and fee and commission income from non-bank subsidiaries 
improved meaningfully as well. Meanwhile, our inorganic growth through M&A 
brought visible results leading to sustain solid fundamentals.Group Profitability OverviewNet Interest Income

 3,311.8Group Net Profit(KRW in billions)Banking vs Non-banking* Based on net profit on a recurring basisNet interest income amounted to KRW 9,722 billion, up by 5.7%, despite a 
contraction in NIM following the Bank of Korea rate cut by 75bp. This is primarily 
attributable to solid loan growth of the bank, which helped to secure stable 
earnings base and the result of inorganic growth through M&As. Group and 
Bank NIM recorded 1.76% and 1.51%, respectively, contracted by 0.18%p and 
0.16%p year on year, both reflecting the effect of low interest rate followed 
by key rate cut. Even in a situation where asset yield contraction continued 
following the interest rate decline, our NIM was relatively well defended owing to 
continued margin management efforts. We will make all our efforts to manage 
our NIM by increasing core deposits utilizing our superior sales capability, 
channel competitiveness and applying more selective loan pricing strategy.The Group’s net fee and commission income was KRW 2,959 billion, increased 
by KRW 604 billion or 25.6% year on year, providing a big support to the group’s 
core earnings growth. Such growth in net fee and commission was driven by 
sizable increase of KRW 347 billion from brokerage fees in the securities business 
with increased average stock trading volume, as well as expanded credit card 
fees on the back of robust marketing and cost savings efforts, which led to 
better performances from non-bank subsidiaries. As such, quarterly net fee and 
commission income was around KRW 500 billion level in the past, but now has 
expanded to around KRW 800 billion since the beginning of the year, continuing 
to show solid growth.Group G&A expense recorded KRW 6,833 billion, up by 9.0% year on year. It 
was mainly attributable to sizable ERP cost of KRW 344 billion and M&A effect, 
amounting to KRW 243 billion, following the acquisition of Prasac, Prudential Life 
and Bukopin in 2020. The rise may seem significant this year, if excluding special 
items like the ERP expense and the M&A impact, G&A expenses, on a recurring 
basis, increased by 2.6% year on year.In 2020, group cost-income ratio(CIR) remained almost unchanged from the 
previous year at 54.7%, despite scaled-up ERP and M&A-related cost, which 
is attributable to improved revenue generation and group-wide cost control 
efforts. In particular, CIR for 2020, on a recurring basis, stood at 49.4% level, 
demonstrating a continued downward trend for the past 5 years. We plans to 
manage CIR to a mid-40% level, by expanding revenue sources and cost control 
from the zero-based perspective.The provision for credit losses amounted to KRW 1,043 billion, up by KRW 373 
billion, mainly due to preemptive provisioning against COVID 19, amounting to 
KRW 377 billion, applying conservative forward looking criteria against COVID 
19 induced uncertainties and preemptive reclassification of stage 1 loans to 
stage 2 loans; Excluding such preemptive provisioning, it remained flat to the 
previous year level.2020 Group credit cost slightly inched up over the year to 0.26%, mainly 
due to aforementioned preemptive provisioning. Excluding such preemptive 
provisioning, credit cost stands at just 0.20% level and is still being managed at 
a stable level. With prolonged COVID 19, there has been increasing concerns 
about asset quality. However, in order to preemptively prepare for these 
uncertainties and to improve our capability to respond, we have additionally 
provisioned conservatively to secure a buffer. At the same time, we have 
considerably stepped up our risk management efforts by reinforcing our risk 
management system by industries and borrowers type, and strengthening 
monitoring for vulnerable borrowers. As such, we believe that our asset quality 
will be managed stably.By subsidiary, KB Kookmin Bank’s net profit amounted to KRW 2,298 billion, fall by 
KRW 141 billion from the previous year, mainly due to sizable ERP cost increase 
and preemptive provisioning related to COVID 19, even net interest income 
expanded driven by solid loan growth and M&A effects such as Prasac and 
Bukopin, and income from securities, derivatives and FX meaningfully improved 
on the back of our efforts to increase invested assets and improve portfolio 
diversification. Noteworthy the financial results of Prasac, consolidated from April 
2020, contributed to the group’s earnings approximately KRW 83 billion for the 
year. As for now, the net profit contribution of global business was 5% level of net 
profit of the bank, but we expects to grow substantially.Meanwhile, the G&A expenses amounted to KRW 4,201 billion, up by KRW 314 
billion, which reflects KRW 302 billion of ERP cost for 810 employees and an 
additional G&A expenses related to the acquisitions of Prasac, Bukopin and other 
overseas institutions which have been included as bank subsidiaries. Bank CIR 
inched up over the year to 53.6% on the aforementioned ERP cost and M&A-related expenses; but, CIR on a recurring basis stood 47.2%, which represents its 
continued downward move following cost reduction efforts. Provisions for credit 
losses posted KRW 484 billion, up by 380 billion from the previous year, mainly 
due to the preemptive provisioning related to COVID 19, but excluding this, it 
managed at a stable level.KB Kookmin Bank Profitability OverviewNet Interest Income

(5.8)In 2020, KB Securities’ net profit increased by KRW 168 billion from the previous 
year to KRW 426 billion, due mainly to a sizable increase in brokerage fees 
supported by robust stock trade volume growth and all-out sales efforts. By 
business sector, WM boosted its earnings performance with a huge increase in 
brokerage fees an effective efforts at expanding its individual customer market 
share pushing the Prime Club service; S&T struggled in performance against 
a COVID 19-induced financial volatility hike in the first quarter, but quickly 
recovered thought the year, as the financial market regained its footing; and 
IB strengthened its market position not only in DCM but also ECM and M&A as 
well on the back of the competitive edge-sharpening efforts over the years. As 
a result, KB Securities’ ROE reached a laudable 8.8% level.KB Insurance’s net profit posted KRW 164 billion, decreased by KRW 70 billion 
from the previous year, owing to a decrease in investment income, resulted 
from impairment losses of overseas alternative investment, triggered by COVID 
19-induced economic downturns. On the other hand, embedded value as 
of end of 2020, grew 18.1% over the year to about KRW 7.8 trillion on the 
strength of value-driven management approaches focusing on the value of 
new purchased contract. Loss ratio recovered by 0.5%p to 85.5% due mainly 
to a 7.3%p improvement in auto insurance loss ratio following a reduction in 
accidents on the back of COVID 19.IntroductionCore CompetencyManagement’s Discussion & AnalysisOperation ReviewFinancial SectionAppendix030KB Kookmin Card’s 2020 net profit amounted to KRW 325 billion, which

network in the industry. ‘KB Mobile Certification, the industry’s first private ID verification service, attracted 7.3 million users in 20 months from the roll 
out, a clear testament to its usability and security. Also in 2020, we completed ‘The K Project’, a next-generation IT infrastructure-based digitalization 
project, bringing to reality seamless connections between online and offline spaces, and creating a digital environment that stands apart.Total Assets (KRW in trillons)Net Interest Income (KRW in billions)Digital FinanceCreating a platform from a customer perspective
In 2020, KB Kookmin Bank laid the basis for transforming into a financial platform 
company that can fast adapt to market and environment changes. We overhauled 
the operating structure into a platform-focused organization where the business 
and technological units can closely work together. Through such a platform 
organization, which is synonymous with a DevOps organization where planning, 
development and operation all take place simultaneously for enhanced customer 
experience, we will accelerate our digital innovation drive. The infrastructure 
of our banking operations also underwent digitization: ‘The K Project’, a next-
generation IT system comprising AI, big data, and cloud technologies, went into 
a full operation mode, providing hyper-connected financial services seamlessly 
linking branches, call centers, mobile and many other channels.In 2021, the financial industry is expected to see big changes take place, as 
implementation of MyData business, amendment of the Electronic Financial 
Transaction Act and launch of payment businesses.In response to such competition-intensifying developments, KB Kookmin Bank 
will secure a position of advantage in the banking market and ride the digital 
wave to being a solid No.1 financial platform company. To this end, we will 
first consolidate diverse platform functionalities dispersed throughout group 
operations onto KB Star Banking and Liiv, and retool the core platforms to create 
new customer value and business synergies. Also, by further upgrading the 
platforms to the extent that they’d be optimized for mobile banking as well as by 
constructing an open infrastructure, we will lay a base that is flexible to adoption 
of new technologies.With respect to content, we will strengthen MyData-based asset management 
practices, develop products and services by customer segment, and expand KB 
Mobile Certification-based business. Also, by nurturing the platform organization 
to take root, we will plant an agile corporate culture that can proactively 
reflect the fast-evolving customer needs and propensities in our daily businessoperations; and by developing digital technology experts using diverse avenues 
of education and training, will further solidify the base for incorporating platform 
business.The K Project for the next leap forward
The K Project was successfully completed in 2020 as part of the group strategy to 
lead the industry in digital innovation and leap toward a future where the brand 
KB will be synonymous with innovation. The K Project is crucial to completing KB 
Kookmin Bank’s digital transformation. A next-generation computational system 
based on an advanced IT infrastructure of AI, big data, and cloud computing, 
the project supports seamless connections among various on/offline channels 
and offers a digital banking experience unimaginable a few years ago. With the 
successful completion of the project, we have secured an infrastructure that 
proactively responds to changes in the business environment, enables employees 
to improve their job performance on the basis of the seamless work support they 
receive, and offers customers a wide range of financial services each customized 
to their individual needs and preferences.KB Mobile Certification with growing users
In 2020, amended Digital Signature Act took effect, setting off the race for 
dominance in a potentially explosive digital authentication market. KB Kookmin 
Bank also jumped in the race with the roll out of ‘KB Mobile Certification’. The first 
and only ID authentication service introduced by a financial institution, KB Mobile 
Certification is not only advanced in security but also superior in user convenience: 
unlike the government-authenticated certificate, which involves a complex and 
time-consuming process that often requires tedious revalidations and multiple 
passwords, our authentication system requires a relatively simple process available 
through KB Star Banking. Using KB Mobile Certification Service, customers can 
conduct not only mobile but also web-based internet banking by tethering their 
phones. As of the end of 2020, the KB certification service was applied to six 
financial services platforms of five KB subsidiaries. Having surpassed a 7.3 million

In January 2021, we introduced a cloud-based ‘Liiv Real Estate’ app, an upgrade 
to the existing real estate platform ‘Liiv On’. Compared with its predecessor, 
Liiv Real Estate is superior in app operation speed and other basic performance 
functionalities: the real estate listing has vastly expanded with a curator feature 
that, with a few clicks of buttons, shows pictures, videos and data not only of 
properties but nearby and surrounding complexes as well. Such visual materials and 
property data are produced in-house and also shared via diverse SNS channels, 
including Naver TV, Kakao TV, YouTube, Facebook.MVNO-based financial and telecommunication platforms

In response to an intensifying banking industry competition, a COVID 19-induced 
increase  in  demand  for  contactless  financial  transactions,  and  economic 
downturn, KB Kookmin Bank focused on the following actions: overhauling 
a group customer loyalty program, KB Star Club; strengthening customer 
management with exclusive services for prime customers; expanding non-
financial preferred service benefits for prime customers; introducing special 
benefit programs and target campaigns aimed at enhancing loyalty among prime 
and longer-term customers.To expand KB’s dominance in retail banking, we launched MZ generation-tailored 
deposit package products; savings products combined of finance, ESG and 
telecommunications; and loan products for the newly wed, pensioners, military 
personnel, foreigners, KB Star Club members and other customer segments. 
We also reduced funding costs and expanded the base for stable funding by 
increasing retail core deposits and attracting settlement-type accounts. To spur 
online product sales, we carried out target sales activities based on internal 
and external customer data, built systems for marketing hub EBM, developed 
potential online customers, conducted a CRM campaign, and realigned products, 
services and processes toward expanding the boundary of contactless sales 
channels.We also launched new products each followed by a sales campaign intended to 
raise public awareness of key financial issues and social trends: ‘KB Clean Ocean’ 
savings was introduced in June 2020, as a follow-up to the success of ‘KB Clean 
Sky’ savings rolled out in 2019; and ‘KB My Fit Package’, a savings product, 
launched in the same month for MZ generation. Also by developing or renewing 
products specialized by age, profession, nationality and other segment, we met 
diverse financial product needs and thus strengthened product differentiation 
and competitiveness.In 2021, we expect to see the global and domestic economies slow down in 
growth rate and interest rates stay ultra low, following a protraction of COVID 19 
and resultant uncertainties. Also expected is an intensifying competition in the 
financial industry. In response, we will establish customer management systems 
that are seamlessly connected through diverse channels; optimize the product 
lineup through expansion of partnerships and joint promotion products; adopt a 
bank-wide integrated marketing approach; maximize the marketing performance; 
secure a market dominance in the core areas of main operations; and bolster our 
unsurpassed competitive advantages in retail banking through seamless omni 
channel between on/offline processes.management. Such efforts to expand differentiated advisory services were made 
as the launch of a service guiding landowners through the intricate process of 
being compensated by the government for their land included in infrastructure 
development projects; a ‘Legal Risk Assessment Service’ targeting SMEs and 
CEOs was; and a ‘Special Tax Service’ for overseas Koreans.Key  strategic  areas  of  WM  to  focus  in  2021  include  solidifying  the  WM 
base  with  a  focus  on  customer  value;  bolstering  the  competitiveness  of  
investment advisory services and the KB brand; strengthening the leadership 
in WM product competitiveness; pivoting from product sales to total asset 
management; and establishing investor rights protection systems.Offering total WM management services in collaboration with KB 
affiliates
In addition to market dominance, KB Kookmin Bank is focused on product and 
service development through collaboration with its affiliates, offering one-
stop asset management services that stand out among peers. Amid COVID 
19-induced difficulties, we put a lot of effort into bolstering asset management 
services:  supplying  investment  products;  conducting  asset  management 
webinars; and operating ingenious contactless marketing programs employed, all 
developed to the needs of, and through active communication with, customers 
that evolved along with fluctuations in market volatility.The direction for operating VIP Lounge, a channel through which customer-
specific consulting service are offered, was redefined through the following steps: 
a reservation system for the VIP Lounge service was implemented at 42 branches 
on a trial basis; and branches offering the VIP Lounge service were increased 
from 380 to 488 over the year 2020. Also, with the establishment of ‘KB PB Biz 
Innovation’ plan, two branch-in-branch PB centers were launched, as well as  PB 
Center-branch joint sales pilot program were implemented.The optimization of the channel coverage of WM hybrid branches was pursued 
through the opening of six branches and the closure of one in line with the 
rationalization of securities branches. Bank-sourced WM product sales practices 
were revised; ‘Happy Call’ was created, a system for thanking customers for their 
business referrals; and other steps taken to improve the process of outsourcing 
WM products and of managing post-sale activities and to thus reduce risks 
associated with incomplete sales. Also efforts were made to improve customer-
focused synergy evaluation standards in the interest of generating genuine 
synergies.Asset management product sales were facilitated through the opening of four 
consulting centers in the PG 2.0-linked regions, followed by various customer 
segment-specific seminars and a one-on-one consulting service by asset 
management specialists. Asset management/advisory services were made 
popularized with the creation of a Youtube channel dedicated to KB wealthCorporate BankingFine-tuning CIB models and managing crisis situations 
In corporate banking, KB Kookmin Bank focused on preemptive management 
of risks and on fine-tuning CIB models, actively responding to a continuation of 
COVID 19-induced market uncertainties. Amid challenging business situations, 
we pursued to establish a branch in Singapore, which is expected to become a 
Southeast Asian financial hub, with a plan to expand the localization of its sales 
force. Also, the risk factors of overseas alternative investments were preemptively 
managed,  and  asset  and  risk  management  operations  were  effectively 
implemented in line with developing market situations.While continuing to execute an investment-driven IB strategy, we established a 
mid- to long-run roadmap, ‘KB Green way 2030’, declared an anti-coal policy, 
and joined the Equatorial Principles, thus reaffirming our leadership in ESG 
management. In support of the successful implementation of the Korean New 
Deal, we established a detailed business strategy and accordingly carried out our 
key role as a leading financial institution. Besides, we won the Sejong Smart City 
project in collaboration with LG CNS, secured corporate restructuring projects, and 
achieved feats noteworthy in the strategic areas in the coming post COVID era.We made our organization more agile and action-oriented, streamlining the 
decision-making process and leveling up the work process across all our 
operations. Specifically, we adopted a three-division system, instituting a healthy 
competition framework; bolstered the London IB unit with an addition of IB 
specialists; rationally improved performance evaluations by restructuring IB 
double counting systems and adopting the system of requiring minimum earning 
returns; and automated systems for managing real estate PF and fund assets, 
which resulted in efficiency improvements.“To develop future growth  
engines that are self-sustainable, 
we accelerate our pace of  
global expansion.”Money Trust DepositoryKRW26.0 trillionKB Kookmin Bank accounted for 19.6% of

branch and strengthening the branch’s deal sourcing capabilities in the interest 
of building an organization optimized for the branch’s transition to global IB. In 
investment-driven IB, deal sourcing will be strengthened based on a mid- to 
long-run investment plan, and income sources diversified through proactive 
securities investment. Policy and market changes will be proactively embraced, 
and market dominance strengthened through expansion of new business sales. 
To this end, ESG-related investment and finance will be further expanded and 
exposure to coal-related deals reduced on a continual basis.SME BankingBolstering productive finance support
In 2020, the Korean government focused on strengthening its “productive 
finance” support, inducing the financial industry to shift its funding support from 
the household and real estate sectors to promising SMEs on the forefront of 
innovation technology. In response, KB Kookmin Bank embraced such a policy 
shift and subsequently increased its SME loans by KRW 109 trillion in 2020, 
securing the largest market share. In particular, loans extended SMEs with high 
credit ratings grew 1.7%p over the year to 79.3% in proportion, as the result of 
which, the delinquency rate remained at a stable 0.15% as of the year-end.Accelerating the digitalization of corporate banking in  
an contactless era
Accelerating the digitization of its corporate banking operations, KB Kookmin 
Bank is proactively responding to a rapidly evolving business environment. We 
upgraded ‘KB bridge’, an corporate banking app customized to policy funding, 
and reintroduced it as a non-financial services platform offering market analysis, 
business partner arrangement and other consulting services on business startup, 
tax, intellectual property and import/export; and improved ‘Corporate Banking 
ACE’, a sales app, with the addition of a network analysis-based search engine 
for finding prospective customers, enhancing the app’s effectiveness as a 
sales tool. Moreover, the entire corporate credit process was digitized, from 
submitting loan application documents to evaluation, transaction to follow-up 
documentation; and an automated credit evaluation model was developed in the 
interest of reducing work loads and streamlining the decision-making process.Global OperationGlobal expansion achievements
In April 2020, KB Kookmin Bank successfully acquired a 70% equity stake in 
Prasac Microfinance. As of 2019, Cambodia’s largest microfinance deposit-
taking institution had some 180 branches nationwide, held a 41.1% market share 
as of the end of 2018, reported 28.2% in ROE and about USD 101 million innet income, and ranked 3rd in loan market share among all financial institutions 
including commercial banks in Cambodia.In August, we also successfully completed the acquisition of Bukopin with a 67% 
stake in Indonesia’s mid-sized bank. Since the July 2018, purchase of a 22% 
stake in the Indonesian bank, we had been focusing on ways to share our risk 
management, retail and digital banking, IT and other knowhow with Bukopin. 
At the same, we had been timing our emergence as the majority shareholder 
of Bukopin, and with full support from local financial authorities, were able to 
consummate the years-long undertaking. Also, with Indonesian subsidiaries of KB 
Insurance, KB Kookmin Card, KB Capital, and other KB affiliates, Bank Bukopin is 
laying the foundation for its transition to a bona fide financial group in the most 
populous ASEAN country. Established in 1970, Bank Bukopin covers the whole 
nation through a network of 434 branches and 850 ATMs, offering traditional 
retail banking services, including SME loan.In December 2020, KB Kookmin Bank established a subsidiary in Myanmar, the 
country’s first foreign-owned bank. In an ASEAN member with high growth 
potential, we plan to develop the subsidiary into a leading foreign bank that 
offers mortgage, digital finance, corporate banking, infra finance, other advanced 
one-stop financial services.Energizing import & export banking
In 2020, KB Kookmin Bank signed with Korea Trade Insurance Corporation a 
business agreement to invigorate overseas trade finance for SMEs and mid-
sized corporations. Per the agreement, trading companies, after submitting 
applications for trade finance, can receive from KB Kookmin Bank finance 
assistance with their guarantee and insurance payments. To enable such support, 
we plan to contribute a special fund to Korea Trade Insurance Corporation which, 
for its part, is to use the fund toward facilitating the foreign trade of SMEs and 
mid-sized corporations for four years to the tune of KRW 500 billion. Also per 
the agreement, the traders benefit from an expanded credit line and discounted 
interest and fee rates, and KB Kookmin bank ensure the stability of its trade 
finance business with a high-grade collateral thus secured. Going forward, we 
will actively keep in step with the government policy of supporting import/export 
businesses in response to COVID 19-induced crises.Also, proactively reflecting fast-spreading contact-averse trends and related 
evolving customer needs, KB Kookmin Bank strengthened the lineup of online 
products and services. We rolled out ‘KB-Easy Overseas Remittance’ enabling 
KB Star Banking customers to quickly send money overseas without going 
through their designated FX account service. To improve customer convenience 
in overseas remittance, we expanded the category of remittance purposes to 
include bestowal, overseas study and foreigner wages. For corporate clients, 
‘Foreign Currency Firm Banking Service’ was introduced, through which clients 
can effectively manage their foreign currency holdings as well as transfer large 
amounts in foreign currency overseas with ease.Trust

challenging  market  conditions  reflective  of  a  plethora  of  COVID  19  
uncertainties compounded by a government-imposed delay on large-scale ELT 
redemptions as well as limit on ELT sales, KB Kookmin Bank increased the supply 
of ELB, ABSTB and other principal-guaranteed products more attuned to the 
preferences of risk-averse investors; also expanded was the ETF product lineup 
following a release of new products in line with a growing customer demand 
stoked by a recovering investment sentiment. In addition, strategic marketing 
activities were implemented and efforts continued to improve customer service 
in the interest of earning trust. As a result, revenue from trust products sold 
in 2020 amounted to KRW 163.8 billion. As of the year-end, the balance of 
money trusts amounted to KRW 26.0 trillion, which represents the industry’s 
largest market share of 19.6%; and that of ELT stood at KRW 8.7 trillion, also 
the industry’s largest of 33.6%. As such, KB Kookmin Bank held the largest trust 
balance among Korean banks, maintaining the industry’s top position in revenue.In 2020, we launched diverse specialty products as a way to build up the 
trust product lineup in line with customer needs and to strengthen product 
competitive: ‘KB MyLife Trust’ reflects an ageing population, lowering birth 
rates, 1-person households and other social changes taking place; ‘KB Clean 
Ocean Trust’ donates a portion of its proceeds to programs protecting marine 
ecosystems; and ‘KB Life SOC Public Interest Trust’ directs donations from local 
community organizations and members toward the maintenance and operation 
of daily-life infrastructures. The growing investor interest in ESG effects on 
corporate earnings performances was followed by a rush of funds into related 
products: ‘ESG Social Responsibility Investment ETF’, the largest of domestic ESF 
products, exceeded KRW 100 billion in AUM, as of the end of 2020; and ‘Korea 
New Deal ETF’ was launched, which invests in the secondary battery, bio, internet 
and game sectors.In 2021, anticipating a global economic recovery and glowing signs of ample 
liquidity, KB Kookmin Bank plans to improve profitability by increasing the 
supply of customer-tailored ELT products and expanding the sales of ETFs with 
high growth potential. Also planned is a pursuit of quantitative growth through 
expansion of the lineup of overseas real estate and other alternative products 
and property trust sales. Efforts will continue to develop new products and to 
upgrade asset management trust products to the stages of customer life cycle. 
Looking to retain customers and to enhance their loyalty in the mid to long 
run, we will advance customer-based asset management systems and improve 
complete sales of trust products and post sales customer relations management.“We should focus on expanding  
an seamless service that enables 
customers to use any channel of 
their choice with ease.”Retirement Pension ReservesKRW33.1 trillionRanked first in net reserve increases

As customers’ lifetime financial partner working to cement the ‘Pension No.1 
KB’ status, KB Financial Group seeks to improve the management of customer 
investment returns, offer specialty products that stand out, and support the 
management of customer pension assets based on integrated asset management 
systems of digital technology. At the Group level, retirement pension reserve 
accrued in 2020 exceeded KRW 5 trillion, a first among financial groups, amounted 
to KRW 33.1 trillion. Of the net increase, KRW 4.2 trillion was generated by KB 
Kookmin Bank, thereby maintaining the banking industry’s best performance over 
the past three years.To improve customer asset returns in the face of low interest rates, we are offering 
differentiated customer management services, including rebalancing pension 
asset portfolios, through a unit dedicated to managing customers and earning 
rates. In particular, by increasing the workforce at the ‘Pension Asset Management 
Consulting Center’, which offers a 1:1 consulting service, we improved the service 
for current and potential customers having problems managing their retirement 
assets. Also, by holding webinars on how to rebalance low-performing investment 
portfolios and TDF, we sought to improve the performance of portfolios consisting 
mostly of specialty pension and retirement products.Also, new services and systems were offered to help pension customers better 
manage their accounts: ‘Pension K-Bot SAM’, an AI-based service recommending 
portfolios by customer need and preference; ‘One-Stop Online Service’ rendering 
fast and effortless all pension account activities, from account opening to transfer 
to payment receipt; ‘Pension Retirement DC Mobile’ for workers with DC plans

dedicated to helping customer better manage assets for their retirement, in the 
interest of meeting growing needs of a fast-ageing yet increasingly affluent 
population in Korea. As a response to a COVID 19-induced customer demand 
for contact-free services, online retirement asset management seminars were 
regularly held, and non-face-to-face channels for retirement planning retooled to 
make them more customer-friendly.In 2021, such new services and systems will be rolled out for the purpose of 
improving retirement and pension-related services as: ‘KB Signature Report’, a 
service offering a variety of information related to retirement asset management 
with an aim toward preventing customers from neglecting their assets; ‘e-Vote’, 
a system assisting with corporate clients’ adoption of employee retirement plans; 
‘KB-Easy Direct System’, for more efficient pension operations and thus improved 
customer experience; ‘KB Golden Life X’, a web-based integrated service offering 
healthcare, life, financial content for the more active and prolific X generation; 
and ‘One-Click’, a contact-less process for replacing products with another.Also, the Retirement Asset Management Consulting Center will be further 
expanded for a more customer-friendly consulting service to be available in many 
regional bases; an asset management service will be offered through on/offline 
retirement asset management seminars, through which senior customers can 
communicate with asset managers with ease.Capital Markets
In 2020, amid fears of a global economic downturn and a continuation of 
volatility in the financial market, both induced by COVID 19, KB Kookmin Bank 
successfully issued a variety of sustainable debt instruments on the basis of its 
highest credit ratings among commercial banks and of a keen interest among 
investors.The USD 500 million 5-year senior sustainability bond was issued in April 
2020, drawing a lot of attention from ESG and international investors, and 
it was Korea’s first foreign currency-denominated subordinated “COVID 19 
Response” Sustainability Bond. Offering an interest rate of US 5-year treasury 
bond yield plus 150bps, the sustainability bond attracted some USD 3.9 billion in 
subscription, 7.8 times the target amount, from 181 institutions.In July 2020, a EUR 500 million 5-year covered bond was successfully issued in 
a sustainability format, the first of its kind among domestic commercial banks, 
subscribed mostly by professional ESG investors and new investors of the Euro 
zone, which resulted in an expansion of the investor base. Compared to foreign 
currency-denominated subordinated bonds issued by domestic commercial 
banks, the covered bond carries a lower funding cost of mid swap plus 40bps (YTM 
rate of 0.052%).Another COVID 19 response sustainability bond was issued in October 2020: a 
USD 500 million 10-year Basel III-compliant tier 2 subordinated bond, successfully 
issued with the lowest rate of foreign currency-denominated subordinated bonds 
issued by domestic commercial banks. Over-subscribed by USD 2.6 billion by 135 
global institutions, most of which were from US institutional investor. It contributed 
a great deal to widening the investor distribution base which had been comprised 
mostly of Asian and European institutions from US institutional investor.For its successful sustainability bond issues in 2020, KB Kookmin Bank has 
not only secured new sources of capital, but also been duly recognized for 
a successful diversification of its investor base with an inclusion of socially 
responsible investors. Going forward, we will maintain our leadership in the ESG 
bond market through continual bond issuance.NCSIIn 2021, we will double our effort to expand the base for a quantum jump of 
the asset market business. While continuing efforts to upgrade the capabilities 
to manage the existing business, we will implement efforts to advance ALM/

Financial product also continued to multiplied. We secured our DCM dominance 
and made meaningful achievements in ECM, M&A finance and all other IB sectors. 
In particular, we excelled in ECM, garnering LG Energy Solutions, Kakao Bank 
and other big IPO and rights issue deals; on the strength of such achievements 
do we plan to grow into a No.1 securities company in IB. In S&T, we increased 
incomes from our fixed income operations through a strategic response to a 
historically low interest rate environment; and in wholesale, expanded our slice of 
the institutional sales market, augmented commission incomes related to block 
deal/employee-owned stock orders, increased new business trades, and improved 
profits in the entire wholesale operations.425.6Dominated DCM for the decade
KB Securities garnered 21.4% of the DCM market (by Bloomberg standard), 
thereby securing the top position in the DCM league table for a tenth year in 
a row. In addition to corporate bonds, we lead-managed the issuance of the 
industry’s first movable asset-backed as well as KAMCO-guaranteed asset-
backed corporate bonds, introduced the industry’s first hybrid bond, and issued 
Arirang and Kimchi bonds, building up a formidable presence in diverse DCM 
areas. We also were in the forefront of ESG and global bond issuance for domestic 
business leaders, and of supplying promissory notes, the balance of which 
amounted to around KRW 3 trillion, by the end of 2020.Specialized digital asset management services
In February 2002, KB Securities opened ‘Prime Center’ offering professional 
asset management services via online and other non-face-to-face channels; 
and in April 2020, launched ‘Prime Club’ offering premium asset management-
related information for a monthly subscription fee of KRW 10,000. Prime Club is 
the industry’s first subscription-based asset management service offering a wide 
range of services, ranging from vital investment information for small-amount 
investors and online customers via the MTS ‘M-able’ channel to PB’s consulting 
services for those who need professional help. Its membership exceeded 160,000 
as of the end of 2020, with customer assets surpassing KRW 3 trillion.Improving customer experiences 
MTS M-able, KB Securities’ leading mobile trading system, underwent two 
large-scale upgrade attempts, in February and June, 2020, for improvement in 
usability. As a result, the upgraded version features easy trading modes enablingeven beginners to delve into stock trading online, a chat-based UX-centered 
account creation process, a home screen comprehensively showing a variety of 
trade information, a screen for overseas stock trading, and an improved process 
for trading financial products. Other customer satisfaction-enhancing additions 
include the industry’s first sign-in process using a facial recognition technology 
and an open banking service enabling users to check the balance of, and transfer 
between, accounts at other financial institutions. As a result of these and other 
improvements, the number of newly created online accounts grew 241% in 2020, 
while the number of users of M-able averaged over 600,000 a month.Strengthening overseas stock brokerage services 
With  a  growing  interest  in  overseas  stocks  among  domestic  investors,  we 
continued to make the trading of such stocks all the more easy and convenient: 
open/stop orders and algorithm trading, a functionality once reserved only for 
pension funds and other institutional investors, were made available in the mobile 
and home trading systems of ours; and the trading hours were extended by four 
and a half hours to accommodate the stock trading hours in the US. As a result of 
these and other additions, customer assets in overseas securities jumped 673% 
over the course of 2020 to KRW 29 billion.Increasing global footprints 
KBSV, KB Securities’ subsidiary in Vietnam, reported a pre-tax income of KRW 
10 billion in 2020, the third year of its business. The subsidiary’s earnings 
performance in IB and bond brokerage was particularly impressive, representing a 
65% increase over the year. The subsidiary also played a key role in the launch of 
‘KB Fina’, a digital financial platform. The Hong Kong subsidiary increase its bond 
brokerage income by 39% through Repo and other leverage operations, and by 
lead-managing KB Capital’s USD bond issue, successfully completed the foreign 
currency-denominated bond issue. Thus buoyed, KB Securities plans to further 
expand its presence in overseas bond markets. The New York subsidiary increased 
in/outbound brokerage sales by 177%, and contributed to strengthen synergetic 
collaborations between KB Securities and Jefferies Group.2021 Plans

days ago continued its growth and the money move accelerated its ascendancy.The  year 2021  is  expected  to  see  the  COVID  19-induced restrictive  sales 
environment continue and competition among digital financial services providers 
intensify further. In response, KB Securities will focus on the following tasks.Firstly, to level up our core competitive advantages, we will systemize customer-
centric CPC strategies, and upgrade Prime Club into a best-in-class service and 
thus offer better-quality WM services to contact-averse customers.In IB, with a focus on meeting growing post-COVID corporate needs for business 
restructuring, financial structure improvements and other related upgrades, we 
first will seek to achieve our triple-crown (DCM, ECM, M&A) goal; and through 
proactive response to toughened real estate regulations and the Korean New 
Deal, we will solidify our position as an IB leader.In S&T, by leveraging our strengths in fixed income operations, we will bolster 
equity-related operations and thus increase revenues. In institutional sales, we will 
expand our market share in domestic and overseas institutional equity and passive 
sales through qualitative improvement of product sales.Secondly, to further sharpen our digital edge, we will strengthen digital-based 
business competencies and push forward platform-based business models. To 
achieve this, we will develop new products by customer lifecycle phase based on a 
data-focused customer analysis, strengthen the M-able platform, and further expand 
digital ecosystems, all with an eye toward creating customer value in the contactless 
channel area as well as platform services that are innovative and convenient.Lastly, we will continue revamping ESG management, which has become an 
essential part of sound corporate governance. With this in mind, we have created 
an ESG dedicated unit and set up an ESG roadmap in line with the ESG strategy of 
KB Financial Group; by continuing to reduce carbon emissions and increasing ESG-

joint promotion with KB Kookmin Bank to steer customers toward paying insurance 
premiums through the bank account attracted some 105,000 accounts (85,000 new 
and 20,000 redirected) for the banking affiliate; a campaign encouraging employees 
to recommend KB Kookmin Card  to their friends resulted in 610 new accounts for the

coordinating joint sales with the newly joined subsidiary.In the first quarter of 2021, by jointly launching with KB Kookmin Cards new card 
products embedded with free insurance services, we plan to market the fetus policy 
through joint promotion of the new card. Also in March 2021, with respect to the 
card promotion campaign being actively conducted by our insurance brokers at the 
time of underwriting, we plan to revise the commission payout structure utilizing 
planner channels, which offers diverse benefits, such as filing their income tax 
reports for free, adding card issue-related DB to one of our apps, in order to make 
card sales easier for the reps.Long-term insurance

27.0%, affirming our image as a leader of cancer insurance. The contributing factors 
include the industry’s first product that covers drug expenses for experimental 
treatments, and other new-concept products that either exempt premium payments, 
refund a part of premiums paid, or guarantee other benefits.Accordingly, new protection policies we sold in 2020 accounted for 12.1% in market 
share, up 0.6%p from 2019. Long-term insurance income for 2020 amounted to 
KRW 162.9 billion; and the difference between mortality profits and business costs 
increased KRW 24.9 billion, the result of our all-out efforts at securing income sources 
of changing the base rates and managing loss ratio.Auto insurance
In 2020, the auto insurance market increased 11.6% to KRW 19,551.1 billion on the 
backs of an increasing number of registered automobiles and of hikes in premiumrate. The direct channel market, which in response to COVID 19, evolved increasingly 
toward contactless, soared 19.8% to KRW 8,517.4 billion. In auto insurance sales, KB 
Insurance posted KRW 2,610.6 billion in 2020, up 18.3% from 2019; and its market 
share rose 0.8%p to 13.4%. The CM channel, in particular, generated KRW 663.8 
billion, up 59.5% over the year. The loss ratio of auto insurance came to 84.7%, a 7.3%p 
improvement from 2019.General insurance 
In 2020, the domestic insurance market amounted to KRW 6,198.2 billion, of which, 
commercial lines accounted for 16.4%, or KRW 1,016.9 billion, up 0.4%p over the year. 
To diversify channels and thus stabilize sales, we sought to energize commercial lines 
via planner, branch and direct channels, in addition to the institutional sales channel 
run by employees.In 2020, KB Insurance’s loss ratio averaged 86.9%, a 11.2%p increase from 2019. The 
increase can be attributed to a rise in large-amount accident cases and an additional 
allocation to reserves set aside for the US branch. In response, in renewing KRW 500 
billion plus policies maturing after September 2020, we reviewed associated risks up 
to six months prior and renewed only those deemed safe; and in a proactive response 
to natural disaster risks, we underwrote and held policies in accordance with their 
natural disaster risks.Investment asset management
In asset management, we focused on increasing asset/liability durations through 
the purchase of long-term risk-free bonds in preparation for adoption of K-ICS 
and new capital adequacy requirements. To mitigate an inevitable reduction in ROA 
following the extension of asset/liability durations, we shifted our investment focus to 
quality real estate and SOC-related assets and bond swaps. However, due to COVID 
19-induced effects on the global financial market, we adopted the more conservative 
approach to make new overseas investments.As a result, investment income decreased KRW 114.9 billion to KRW 844.3 billion in 
2020, which represents an ROI rate of 2.85%. AUM rose 6.8% to KRW 30,988.3 billion. 
RBC-based asset/liability duration is projected to be around 12.1, up 1.5%p. Interest 
earning assets accounted for 93% of the portfolio, up 0.2%p, from the previous year.Risk management
The consolidated RBC ratio for 2020 posted 174.8%, 7.6%p lower than that of 2019, 
due to revised retirement accounting rules and interest rate increases. Available 
capital rose KRW 155 billion to KRW 3,812 billion and capital requirement grew KRW 
177 billion to KRW 2,181 billion. The Risk Management Committee, was convened 
every quarter to deliberate and decide on major risk-related issues while the Risk 
Management Council convened monthly to discuss current situations and how to 
improve the major issues of general, long-term, auto and other insurance sectors. The 
three sub-councils of the Risk Management Council carried out detail discussions on 
matters related to products, interest rates, and management.Enhancing customer convenience 
KB Insurance offers a digital technology-based customer experience that stands 
apart from peers’. We offer insurance claim service that is the most advanced in 
the industry, leading the industry enhancing customer convenience with digital 
technology. By introducing the industry’s first mobile notification service in 2020, we 
have significantly improved customer convenience.2021 Plans
The year 2021 is expected to see big tech companies enter the insurance market 
and such emerging risks increase such as natural disasters, new epidemics and cyber 
attacks. In response, KB Insurance will continue its pursuit of sustainable growth in all 
of its operations with a focus on customer-centric and value-focused  competition 
and innovation.In general insurance, to improve sales income, we will continue to push forward new 
property, indemnity and other policies high in profitability, through institutional sales 
channels. To accelerate the growth of sales from planner, GA and direct channels, we 
will develop products to the traits of different channels and further expand automated 
underwriting as a way to lessen the front office’s work load. Also, to recover insurance 
incomes, we will strengthen the management of cumulative risks by disaster region 
and type using geographical data systems.In long-term insurance, we will lead the market by developing comprehensive health and 
cancer insurance products, expand continued insurance premiums through insurance 
management by duration and category, and by expanding differentiated underwriting for 
hospitals, customers and organizations with a dubious claim history and fine-tuning early 
warning systems, will reinforce risk management and increase profitability.In auto insurance, by focusing on direct sales, we will expand the sales with dedicated 
underwriting capabilities and by digitizing core processes across the value chain, will 
enhance cost efficiency, and to improve profit/loss ratio, will revise systems that can 
secure appropriate pricing and induce accident reductions.Embedded Value(EV)KRW 7.8trillion

opening a new chapter of opportunity in its proud history. The holder of the industry's best RBC ratio and a first-rate captive sales channel, i.e. Life Planner, 
will generate greater synergies with its new affiliates and solidify its position as a premier second-to-none insurer customers trust all the more 
on the strength of Korea's most extensive business network and biggest customer base.Joined the Group as 13th subsidiary
Over the past 30 years, Prudential Life has practiced its mission, providing 
customers with financial security and peace of mind, through professional Life 
Planners(LP) and General Agents(GA), on the basis of its firm philosophy and set 
of value. Supported by an army of the industry’s best-rated LPs, we ranked first in 
the certified insurance consultants to ratio of 31.5% in 2020, for a 13th year in a 
row, and recorded 0.06% in incomplete sales ratio, the lowest in the industry. Also 
in 2020, we were appointed ‘Good Life Insurance Company’, for a 11th consecutive 
year, by the Korea Finance Consumer Federation, based on its annual evaluation of 
life insurers’ stability, asset quality, profitability and customer management.As of the end of August 2020, Prudential Life joined KB Financial Group, opening 
a new chapter of opportunity and change. The integration with the nation’s most 
diversified financial group is expected to further shore up the industry’s most 
extensive of customer bases and networks and expand the product and service 
lineup that clearly stand apart from peers.Industry’s best asset quality 
Prudential Life’s RBC ratio reached 428.9% in 2020, a 5%p increase from 2019 
and the industry’ highest. Also, in a recent government stress test conducted in 
preparation for the 2023 adoption of K-ICS in step with IFRS17, we scored above 
capital regulation guidelines, confirming our ability to keep the all important ratio 
well above a confidence-inspiring level.Life Planner channel bolstered
In 2020, with the spread of the COVID 19 pandemic inducing social distancing 
and other practices few imagined before, the life insurance industry encountered 
a host of difficulties across all face-to-face channels. Amid such a challenging 
environment, Prudential Life completed its lineup of unique US dollar protection 
products: as sales of which grew 3% over the course of 2020, they have become 
a main product lineup of ours. Also, to diversify the sales force of region, gender, 
age and other traits, we took on a project of building up the organization with 
a focus on the Greater Seoul City region and provincial capitals. As a result, LPs 
in their 20s and 30s now comprised 35% of the sales force, while female sales 
managers in charge of recruiting LPs increased 5% to 33% in proportion. These 
two facts alone are noteworthy in that they constitute the growth driver that will 
play a crucial role in further expanding the diversity of our customer base.Core General Agency channel expanded
As a result of our years-long efforts at increasing core GAs and diversifying 
partnerships since 2017, GAs exceeding KRW 100 million in annualized CMIP 
grew from 18 in 2017 to 27 in 2020. Which enabled us to lessen the business 
concentration on select GAs and to thus further expand the performance base. 
Also, by including dollar-based variable pension products, we increased the 
ratio of variable pension products to 23% of the GA variable pension market, 
thereby establishing Prudential Life as a leader of the high income individuals and 
corporate retirement life market.Industry-leading work process
To embrace the pandemic-triggered coming of digital transformation and to 
energize the push for collaboration and synergy creation with its affiliates, 
Prudential Life is changing the way it conducts business. Under the banner of 
“Change your surroundings if you want changes!”, we are transforming the entire 
organization into a smart office, the first attempt of its kind in the industry, with 
the goal of changing how we think and work and of achieving an efficient job 
performance and corporate culture. Continuing to support employees working 
remote and to bring changes to the work environment, we will build up a creative 
organizational culture that can stay in line with fast-evolving market demands 
and customer needs.2021 Plans
In 2021, the year Prudential Life begins as a KB affiliate, we will focus on offering 
value more in line with affluent customers, the main target segment of ours, and 
becoming a premier insurance company customers trust most. With a firm focus 
on such a lofty goal, we will pursue the tasks as below.First, we will revamp the LP and GA channels, the two core business mediums of 
life insurance, with an eye toward expanding the affluent market. By upgrading 
the LP channel into a premium outbound channel that can better take advantage 
of KB Financial Group’s diverse networks, we will offer high-income professionals 
not only insurance but also financial and non-financial services, including 
bestowal and retirement planning. To further sharpen the competitive edge 
of the GA channel, we will establish a new business base in Busan, the second 
largest city, and thus extend the channel’s customer base. By fielding strategic 
products in the institutional market, we will maintain our dominance in the 
retirement market. Through these efforts, we will secure a distinctive presence 
and grow into a premium insurer delivering quality solutions optimized to 
customer needs.Second, by taking advantage of KB Financial Group’s customer base and business 
networks, the largest and the most extensive in Korea, we will proactively 
collaborate with our affiliates to maximize synergy effects from a group of best-
in-class financial players working together toward common goals. Looking to lead 
the industry in a post-COVID digital age, we will set up digital business strategies 
in sink with those of our affiliates and improve digital platforms and services to 
offer customers a seamless experience of transcending channel barriers. From 
supplying sales tools for the mobile environment to remote customer service 
and marketing, we will advance the customer service of a digital era toward 
enhancing convenience and accessibility, expecting the integration of group 
customer data to further enhance the value of services customers receive.Third, in search of future business drivers, we will explore as many business 
models as possible and select and execute those found to be more promising. 
Specifically, on the basis of KB synergies, we will explore the viability of entering 
the retirement pension market. As the market is expected to continue its robust 
growth on the strengths of the growing DC and IRP sectors and the business-
friendly government policy, we feel we have what it takes to lead the pension 
market as well, including the industry’s highest RBC ratio and credit ratings. 
Also, by leveraging the LP channel which is highly competitive in customer 
consultation, we can expect to apply up- and cross-selling synergies to signing 
up not only corporations but also their employees and customers.No. 1AI‘Good Life Insurance Company’

customer efforts to build their assets in a stable manner with advanced 
fund management systems.In 2020, KB Capital grew its total assets to KRW 12.8 trillion, a 14.5% increase 
from 2020 and successfully leveraged its diversified business portfolio 
to maintain its stable growth. Net profit increased 21.0% year on year to 
KRW 141.6 billion, exceeding a KRW 100 billion mark for the past four 
consecutive years. The number of used cards listed on KB Cha Cha Cha 
surpassed 140,000, the largest of its kind in Korea.www.kbcapital.co.krKB ChaChaCha 
ranked No.1Growing AUM through unique fund management strategy
In 2020, although equity-type fund sales decreased slightly owing to an 
increase proportional to a rise in direct investments fueled by the robust 
growth of stock markets during the year, overall sales rose 7.0% year on year 
to the industry’s third largest of KRW 45 trillion, on the strength of a sizeable 
increase in fix-income-type, specialty assets and real estate funds.The contributing factors include the rebalancing of the fund lineup with 
funds distinguished by their underlying execution strategies. For example, 
KB Korea New Deal Securities Fund exceeded KRW 200 billion in sales in 10 
months from its roll out, while KB STAR ESG SRI ETF reached its target of 
KRW 100 billion by the end of 2020, establishing itself as the largest of ESG-
related public funds. In addition, KB Onkookmin 2055 TDF Feeder Fund, a key 
retirement pension target date fund, recorded a six-month yield of 23.96%, 
the highest level among domestic TDFs.In April 2020, we created an LDI for managing exclusively marketable securities 
soon to be transferred from KB Insurance and KB Life Insurance, strengthening 
asset management capabilities and fortifying the base for improving returns. 
Also, market competitiveness significantly improved on a synergetic increase 
and an AUM expansion proportional to the growth in insurance assets. With 
the scheduled transfers of alternative investment assets from insurance 
affiliates as well as of AUM from Prudential Life, our market competitiveness is 
expected to further strengthen.AUM (KRW in trillions)Selected as lead manager of OCIO alternative investments 
Also in April 2020, we were selected by the National Health Insurance Corp 
as lead manager to handle its KRW 1 trillion alternate investments for the 
next four years. Winning the coveted contract and thus being industry’s 
first alternative investment OCIO, we plan to build up our track record as a 
viable OCIO, meet institutional investors needs for help with their alternative 
investments, and solidify our position as an OCIO leader specializing in 
alternative investment.Achieving the industry’s largest ESG investments
Also in 2020, increasing investment in diverse environment-related and 
new renewable energy projects, we became the industry’s leader in ESG 
investment. ESG funds amounted to KRW 2.4 trillion at the end of 2020, 
a KRW 1 trillion increase from 2017; of the total, new renewable energy 
funds account for the largest slice. In 2021, we plan to establish KB Asset 
Management as Korea’s leading ESG asset manager by developing ESG public 
offering fund and diversifying investment.2021 Plans
Next  year,  we  plan  to  lay  the  foundation  for  transforming  KB  Asset 
Management into an ETF leader by doubling resources for ETF business: as 
a means to energize our operations targeting institutional investors at home 
and abroad, fixed income-type ETF products will be developed that can 
effectively compete against peers’; and the product lineup will be further 
expanded through listing diverse investor segment-specific products on 
equity-type/overseas ETF markets where we lag behind peers. Also, in EMP, 
robot advisor and other areas that rely on ETF, we plan to expand the synergy 
with ETF business by improving fund performances and expanding AUM using 
a solution advancing strategy using AI analysis capabilities.By creating Korean New Deal-exclusive blind funds and public funds, we 
are building a lineup of strategic New Deal investment funds. By creating 
digital/green New Deal-related blind funds, we plan to expand investment in 
projects related to green-smart school, smart environment facility, solar/wind 
and other daily-life infra power generation. In fact, we have listed five funds, 
including passive and active equity-type and ETF funds, by forming a lineup 
of public funds that invest in businesses expected to benefit from the Korean 
New Deal. By continuing to develop funds, we will emerges as a leading 
Korean New Deal investment manager.Diversifying business portfolio
KB Capital further sharpened its competitive edge in auto financing and 
diversified the business portfolio by expanding retail/corporate financing. 
As a result, while auto financing accounted for 73.5% of total sales, a 4.4% 
decrease from 2019, consumer and corporate financing constituted 14.9% 
and 11.6%, up 2.9%p and 1.5%p, respectively. In consumer financing, a 
credit score-based loan product became a major sales driver, and housing 
financing expanded; in corporate financing, the credit line for quality clients 
was increased and investment financing expanded, with a focus on stability 
and profitability, which resulted in a tangible improvement in the earnings 
performance of core operations.Unveiling KB Cha Cha Cha 3.0 
In November 2019, ‘KB Cha Cha Cha 3.0’ was unveiled, an upgraded version 
of the pre-owned car trading platform which grew its car listing to 140,000 in 
the four years of operation. The upgraded version features an AI-enabled price 
estimation system, a programmable vehicle-recommending functionality, and a 
one-stop service that enables users to check their loan limits on auto financing.Expanding RPA and improving business efficiencies
In 2020, KB Capital reduced over 70,000 hours of work through an adoption of 
Robotics Process Automation(RPA). By placing robots in specific operations, we 
plan to further reduce administrative work load by some 10,000 hours in 2021.Securing mid to long-term growth drivers 
KB Capital is an uncontested No.1 in the imported auto finance market, 
recorded 30.0% of market share as of the end of 2020. Its dominance in 
the imported and pre-owned car financing market is expected to further 
strengthen as alliance is to be formed with Kolon, Deutsche and other 
business groups in the near future. In addition, the Laos subsidiary, KB KOLAO 
Leasing, established in March 2017, grew to the 3rd largest by asset of 29 
lease businesses in the Southeast Asian country. Sunindo Kookmin Best 
Finance, the Indonesia subsidiary, began its business in June 2020. To support 
its overseas subsidiaries, KB Capital successfully raised USD 300 million on the 
strength of its industry-best Moody’s A3. Through a stable supply of capital, it 
plans to lead the growth of its overseas subsidiaries.2021 Plans
In 2021, KB Capital plans to lead the credit finance industry by enhancing 
business efficiencies, expanding its global presence and further digitizing its 
operations. Strengthening the competitiveness of online channels as well as 
that of global and digital operations, we will improve productivity and realize

base with a focus on alliance business. As a result, we achieved KRW 1,715 billion 
in premium income, up 56.9%, and KRW 10.4 tillion in total asset, up 6.3%, 
from the previous year.Despite an unprecedented COVID 19 pandemic and a subsequent economic 
downturn, not to mention strengthened market regulations and an intensified 
industry competition fueled by an onrush of new players, KB Real Estate Trust 
posted a robust earnings performance in 2020: net profit increased 8.4% 
over the year to KRW 66.9 billion.Developing market-friendly products and services
By  offering  market-friendly  products  and  services  that  put  customer 
preferences  and  benefits  first,  we  bolstered  product  competitiveness, 
expanded the target customer segments, and enhanced the level of customer 
preference for KB as an insurance brand. Also, by implementing mobile sales 
support systems, we further enhanced the market familiarity and offered a 
customer-friendly service environment.Accelerating digitalization
We built a smart work place that can maintain its fluidity in an increasingly 
contact-averse  environment  and,  by  improving  product  development 
processes, laid a digitwal biz structure that can effectively respond to fast-
evolving market changes. Also, we endeavored to expand diverse ecosystem 
platforms, building collaborative ecosystems with KB subsidiaries and fintech 
businesses.Responding to regulatory changes
Continuing to implement IFRS17 systems, we established stable infrastructure 
and management decision-making support systems. In preparation for the 
enforcement of the Korean Insurance Capital Standard (K-ICS), we continued 
to expand asset durations while maintaining risk-based capital above the 
recommended level. Furthermore, we employed various methodologies to 
manage risks using internal models and by applying new K-ICS standards and 
segmenting and improving risk coefficients, we sought to develop value-
focused products.Premium income (KRW in billions)2021 Plans
Entering  an  era  of  contactless,  the  insurance  industry  is  staking  its 
sustainability on digital platforms and other contact-free digital business 
systems. Other challenging tasks include a consumer protection-heavy sales 
regulatory environment and such system and regulation changes that will 
substantially affect business incomes and costs as an IFRS 17 and K-ICS, both 
slated for 2023.Our key business strategies are as follows:First, customer-centered growth. Impressed by the sales performance of 
customer needs-focused products introduced in 2020, we will do our best to 
instill in every customer heart and mind our image as an insurance company 
that always puts customers first and foremost.Second, value-focused growth. Only with sustainable value growth can customer 
needs-based product offering and meaningful social contributions be also 
sustainable. Mindful of this truth, we will proactively respond to market and 
regulatory changes, and through pursuit of management efficiency from a long-
term perspective, build up corporate value one complete sale after another.Third, relentless digital transformation. Through such an endeavor, we will 
improve customer experiences, further expand the scope of customer-centric 
business and become a ‘Triple A Massurance’ accessible to anyone, anywhere, 
and anytime.Reinforced preemptive risk management and secured quality growth 
In 2020, we sought to diversify the REIT and urban renewal operations by 
sharpening our competitive edge in build-and-manage trust deals and fine-
tuning the investment focus on real estate market demands, while reinforcing 
the management of risks associated with crisis situations.In trust business, we secured more build-and-manage trust deals than last year 
by leveraging our superior credit ratings; won quality real estate development 
deals by agreeing to a trust contract after a certain percentage of the 
units to be built is sold, thereby substantially lowering risks associated with 
conventional housing development projects; and actively acquired collateral-
backed and non-real estate trust deals that carry relatively low risks.In  reconstruction  business,  we  bolstered  our  competitive  advantages 
by securing diverse channels and winning big contracts, and focused on 
improving our track record in the management of high name-value projects. 
In addition to operating real estate projects, we actively pursued other 
types of business, including being a project agent and handling small-scale 
redevelopment projects.In REIT business, responding to a COVID 19-fueled rise of a consumer 
preference for contactless transactions, we improved sales by diversifying real 
estate investments in projects involving logistics centers and retail business. In 
preparation for the pandemic to disappear, active investment was carried outCommission income (KRW in billions)in an effort to preoccupy high-potential assets.Strengthening  the risk management, periodic monitoring is performed on 
preemptive response processes developed in preparation for emergencies and 
on product-specific limit run-out rates while phase-based progress reviews 
are made on major parts of the projects.2021 Plans
As a response to growing market and client preferences for minimal physical 
interactions, we plan to rely more on non-contact business activity using our 
real estate platform Liiv On, video conference systems, digital contracts and 
other contactless modes.In trust business, we will expand our business network by shifting the sales 
focus from securities firms to community trust credit unions and selectively 
choose projects with a strong market demand. While continuing to lead  
the market shift toward trust company-financed real estate development 
projects by winning hybrid projects of sound structure, we also will increase 
customer contact points in non-real estate trust business by leveraging the 
one-firm synergy of KB Financial Group.In reconstruction business, as a preparation for an aggressive sales approach 
expected from new market entrants and for an active participation of public 
institutions in urban renewal business, we will devise a multi-angle plan to 
manage a pool of new project sites with an eye toward improving sales. By 
securing a foothold in project sites in the metropolitan area of Seoul City and 
provincial regions, we will gain an upper hand in executing small-scale remodeling 
projects the success of which depends largely on efficient site management.In REIT business, we will upgrade investment operations while diversifying the 
business portfolio by participating in public bids and launching wide-ranging 
property-based REIT products. Furthermore, we will advance REIT operations 
to increase the value of REIT assets and maximize operational outcomes 
through successful asset sales.As for long-term uncertainties, we will secure sound asset quality through 
risk management by product and advancement of the entrance and post-
sale management of key portfolios, and preemptively respond to the risk 
management of new business and types for strengthening the management 
of long-term liquidity and capital adequacy.IntroductionCore CompetencyManagement’s Discussion & AnalysisOperation ReviewFinancial SectionAppendix042KB Savings Bankwww.kbsavings.comKB Investmentwww.kbic.co.krKB Savings Bank offers banking products and services tailored to the needs of 
the working class in an effort to help the financially vulnerable improve the quality 
of their lives with the benefits of basic banking services. In 2020, KB Savings Bank 
recorded KRW 17.3 billion of net profit, increased by 6.1% from previous year. 
With the launching of KiwiBank, we established the best online channel 
possible, and by introducing one customer-friendly innovation after another, 
led the industry.As a leading venture investment firm specializing in corporate investment, 
KB Investment contributes to the Korean economy developing new growth 
engines by incubating promising venture firms. In 2020, KB Investment launched 
new venture funds totaling KRW 362.4 billion, including a KRW 200 billion fund. 
Based on such ample investment funds, we are building up a portfolio 
of quality assets.New and hit products and services
KB Savings Bank’s mid interest rate market has been growing at an annual 
rate of 24%. At the end of 2020, our mid-rate loans amounted to about 
KRW 3,500 billion, which represents a 1.8% market share. The leading mid-
rate loan products include ‘Kiwi Mid-rate Loan’, ‘Sunshine Loan’ of Korea 
Inclusive Finance Agency, and ‘Sa-It-Dol 2’ of Seoul Guarantee Insurance. We 
played our role as a stepping-stone by bringing low credit customers shunned 
by commercial banks into the boundary of the financial industry, offering 
convenient financial services on a par with those of internet banks.KiwiBank launched
KB Savings Bank has long been innovating its business infrastructure with a 
focus on digital competitiveness and customer satisfaction. In July 2020, as 
part of our innovation drive, we introduced mobile banking platform ‘KiwiBank’. 
Highlighting its affordable yet advanced characteristics as its name suggests 
(a combination of ‘kind’ and ‘wireless’), the new platform offers contactless 
banking services high in benefit and low in fee.Digital finance improved
‘Kiwi Emergency Loan’ puts cash in the hands of people without the hassle 
of an income or credit verification. Developed for all people, including 
housewives and the unemployed, regardless of income levels, the program 
provides cash to anyone with a Kakao account through its app. Up to KRW 3 
million of loan is available via its website which uses the OCR technology to 
verify the identity of loan applicants.Automated paperless conversion loan
‘Kiwi Loan Conversion’ enables people to convert and consolidate their 
loan accounts dispersed among other savings banks into one mid-rate 
account with ease. Once a loan application submitted online, the program, 
linked to the database of Korea Credit Information Services, displays on the 
mobile device of the applicant the loan products of other banks that can be 
converted, and remits money to the selected accounts in accordance with 
his/her instructions. Through the kiwi loan conversion program, the customer 
can verify the balance of their loan accounts at other banks 24/7 without the 
help of a bank teller or call center.Non-contact ID authentication service
Like an internet-only bank, KB Savings Bank has made all its services available 
online. In fact, the Bank is the industry’s first to apply for government approval 
on its mobile identification verification service as well as system that makes 
possible banking transactions 24/7. The service centers on verifying the 
authenticity of ID holders by matching the submitted information against the 
identification database of Korea Financial Telecommunications & Clearing 
Institute. The development and launch of the 24/7 service has markedly 
improved customer convenience and saved the Bank a great deal of work 
hours and expenses.Creating synergies through collaboration with affiliates
Inclusive finance products (Kiwi Partner, Sunshine Loan, and Sa-it-dol 2) along 
with mortgage loans provided in alignment with the Bank’s loan products are 
available at KB Kookmin Bank branches, and as a result of joint promotions 
conducted and synergies thus generated with other KB affiliates, total loans 
made in link with the affiliates rose 63.9% Year on year in 2020.2021 Plans
In  2021,  KB  Savings  Bank  will  create  outstanding  digital  customer 
experiences by offering convenient services customers can trust, and secure 
competitive advantages on a par with those of internet banks. With these 
and other goals in mind, we will focus on the following tasks in 2021:First, we will expand our dominance in the mid-level interest rate market by 
leveraging KiwiBank’s position of advantage;Second,  preemptively  manage  risks  associated  with  high-risk  asset 
portfolios;Third, continue CIR improvement efforts, strengthening cost management 
measures and digitizing work processes;and Fourth, strengthen long-term growth models based on core IT system

KB Investment contributes to the Korean economy by incubating promising 
venture firms and growth engines. In 2020, KB Investment launched new 
venture funds totaling KRW 362.4 billion, including a KRW 200 billion fund. 
Based on such ample investment funds, we are building up a portfolio of 
quality assets.In 2020, fueled by growing investment outlays by both the private sector and 
policy institutions, the venture investment market grew 0.6% over the year 
to about KRW 4.3 trillion; and newly–launched venture funds amounted to a 
record KRW 6.5 trillion. Fund development and new investment both continued 
to grow throughout the year.As new venture capital firms and associations grew, the former by 16 and 
the latter to a record, in 2020, the competition for creating new funds 
and developing new deals further intensified. Against such a backdrop, KB 
Investment, in collaboration with its affiliates, pursued the strategy of launching 
large  venture  funds,  investing  in  new  growth  industries,  and  bolstering 
capabilities to invest in and incubate new growth startups at home and abroad.New Venture Funds Raised (KRW in billions)• Creating large funds within and outside KBFG
KB Investment developed a KRW 200 billion KB Smart Scale-Up Fund in 
collaboration with two other affiliates, investing in SMEs and venture firms 
ready to scale up their operations.• Offshore funds
We also expanded our global portfolio, launching a USD 30 million KB-MDI 
Centauri Fund, a growth-stage fund, a joint venture fund targeting tech 
companies and markets in Southeast Asian countries. Noteworthy is the 
fund’s diversified global strategies.• Private equity funds
Private equity funds launched in 2020 include Fine KB Corporate Financial

increased KRW 380.0 billion to KRW 1.6 trillion, and new investments grew to 
KRW 234.1 billion, maintaining the growth momentum of 2019.2021 Plans
In 2021, the venture market is expected to continue to grow on a growing supply 
of venture-promoting policy funds. KB Investment will continue implementing 
its mid to long-term growth strategy, fostering investment specialists and 
strengthening business competencies with an aim to go beyond top-tier venture 
capital business and rise as a “Most Influential Venture Capital” in the next 
three years. We will also further broaden our global presence, rebalancing the 
investment portfolio and laying the basis for mid to long-term growth.IntroductionCore CompetencyManagement’s Discussion & AnalysisOperation ReviewFinancial SectionAppendix043KB Data Systems
KB Data Systemswww.kds.co.krKB Credit Informationwww.kbci.co.krIn 2020, KB Data Systems took an active role in digital and platform-centered IT 
projects of KB Financial Group and accelerated sales targeting digital business. 
As a result, we posted KRW 100.0 billion in revenue, built open source-based 
DevOps/cloud infrastructure, and contributed a great deal to the IT innovation  
of KB Financial Group.HUBIn 2020, KB Credit Information recovered delinquent debts totaling about 
KRW 300 billion and posted KRW 39.8 billion in sales, a 3.9% increase from 
the previous year. The increase is laudable in light of unfavorable business 
conditions triggered by a COVID 19-induced diminishing ability of borrowers 
to repay their debt and by government policy-prompted extensions of loan 
maturities and deferrals of interest payments.Next-generation systems successfully developed
In 2020, KB Data Systems successfully completed the revamping of the 
call center system under the KB Kookmin Bank’s ‘The K Project’, and the 
development of information systems and data hub projects. Also, we focused 
on winning such digital technology-intensive projects of group umbrella as 
‘Liiv Real Estate’ and ‘KB Senior Platform’ of KB Kookmin Bank, ‘KB Pay’ of 
KB Kookmin Card, and ‘KiwiBank’ of KB Savings Bank; and as a result, new 
projects won in 2020 amounted to KRW 35.7 billion while sales reached KRW 
20.4 billion.Synergies created through joint IT system development
We expanded our business arm to include participation in the corporate 
banking platform projects at the Group level and sharing our IT know-
how from the planning stage. By operating WiseNet a Group portal system, 
OpenAPI, and other joint IT systems , we actively contributed to improve 
IT efficiencies within The Group. Also, the scope of our IT operations was 
expanded to include KB Securities, KB Capital and other affiliates. In support 
of KB Kookmin Bank’s acquisition of PT Bank Bukopin of Indonesia, we set 
up an IT subsidiary in the ASEAN country, building a proactive collaboration 
system with banking and other KB affiliates.Gross Profit (KRW in billions)Digital business capabilities strengthened
To better perform our role as the Group’s digital/IT hub, we focused on 
strengthening the competency of our digital business operations as well as 
on solution development: we sought to offer our clients value that stands 
out, assigning senior-level engineers and technicians to affiliates’ project TFs 
from the planning stage; and by securing top-notch IT talent, contributed to 
strengthen the IT competency of KB Financial Group. In addition to system 
integration and management, we expanded our role in MSP, a cloud service 
area, and developed DevOps-based digital SI, a new business area, bolstering 
the base for developing new growth drivers. Also developed is the Kronos 
solution, an infrastructure for open source-based DevOps/Cloud, an endeavor 
to secure the capability to lead the innovation of KB Financial Group.2021 Plans
The fast-evolving financial business environment of late requires more than 
ever an active partnership with advanced IT service providers. In 2021, IT 
projects centered on platform and digital business are expected to proceed 
as part of KB Financial Group’s mid to long-term strategy; and in particular, 
we plan to take part in KB Kookmin Bank’s MyData project, KB Savings Bank’s 
development of a next-generation system and other hybrid financial projects. 
As part of this, KB Data Systems will continue to secure and assign top talent 
to the projects of their expertise at the right moment, and thus contribute to 
the successful completion of core digital projects of the Group.In the area of new digital/IT technology, we will seek to promote synergy 
in the IT operations of KB Financial Group through collaboration with KB 
affiliates in major projects such as Kronos, real estate platforms, Liiv, and grow 
into an organization that offers outstanding IT services through attainment 
and internalization of superior digital capabilities.Contributing to the Group’s soundness management
In 2020, KB Credit Information contributed to the asset quality management 
of KB Financial Group by keeping the loan delinquency and default rates of 
KB affiliates in a range manageable from a long-term perceptive. This fact 
becomes more meaningful in view of unfriendly business conditions triggered 
by a COVID 19-induced diminishing ability of borrowers to repay their debt 
and by government policy-prompted extensions of loan maturities and 
deferrals of interest payments.At the end of 2020, debt collection revenue amounted to about KRW 27.4 
billion and some KRW 300 billion was recovered of debts originated from 
the group subsidiaries, both a satisfactory figure in light of the exceptionally 
challenging environment. By actively employing collectors with banking 
and card experiences, applying a fair performance compensation system, 
conducting effective promotions distinguished by debt type, and making other 
efforts, we markedly improved the efficiency and competitiveness of debt 
collection. We also continued to expand our business within the Group by 
bolstering credit recovery and NPL management.By types of debt, KRW 158.0 billion is from debts issued by KB Kookmin Bank, 
KRW 130.6 billion from KB Kookmin Card, and KRW 11.0 billion from other 
subsidiaries.Sales (KRW IN BILLIONS)In 2020, in addition to employing debt collectors with an outstanding track 
record as in 2019, we focused on developing average debt collectors into 
experts. As most of them performed well relative to their peers, they are 
expected to play a key role in the Company gaining a clear competitive 
advantage in the future.In lease investigation, fee income amounted to about KRW 11.9 billion, 
year on year increase of over 125%. Despite a market contraction following 
regulations restricting mortgage loan services, the income increased in the 
second half of 2020 following the signing of a lease investigation contract 
with KB Insurance. Also in 2020, we sought to expand lease investigation 
operations targeting other KB affiliates and to enter diverse business areas 
derivative of investigation business.2021 Plans
In 2021, COVID 19 effects are expected to remain; and as the ‘Consumer 
Credit Act’ goes into effect in the second half, sales of debt collection 
companies are more than likely to contract. Also, the government’s continuing 
policy of protecting vulnerable classes is expected to fan the morale hazard 
of debtors, and current stringent regulations on mortgage loan services could 
hamper lease investigation business.Preparing for a worse, KB Credit Information will stay focused on asset quality 
as a top priority, while making efforts to improve the financial structure.We will continue the effort to maximize the collection of debts and proactively 
respond to any reductions in number of debt cases. New revenue sources 
will be aggressively explored within KB Financial Group, including leases 
investigation on behalf of KB Insurance, KB Capital and KB Savings Bank. IT 
systems, including RPA and digital transformation, will be upgraded as a way to 
cut costs and improve business efficiency and productivity, while continuously 
tightening the management of delinquent customers in line with financial 
consumer protection regulations.IntroductionCore CompetencyManagement’s Discussion & AnalysisOperation ReviewFinancial SectionAppendix044FINANCIAL SECTIONConsolidated Financial Statements  045Separate Financial Statements144Independent Auditors’ ReportBased on a report originally issued in KoreanThe Board of Directors and Stockholders
KB Financial Group Inc.:Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of KB Financial Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (“the Group”), which comprise the 
consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2020, the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity 
and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the 
Group as of December 31, 2020, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance 
with Korean International Financial Reporting Standards (“K-IFRS”).Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing (KSAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described 
in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in 
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the Republic of Korea, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.Emphasis of Matter
As a matter that does not affect our audit opinion, we draw attention to the following matter.As described in note 40.6.i) to the consolidated financial statements, the proliferation of COVID-19 has had a negative impact on the global economy, 
which may have a greater impact than expected credit losses and potential impairment of assets in a particular portfolio, and it could negatively affect 
the profit generation capability of the Group.Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial 
statement as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements 
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.1. Assessment of the allowances for credit losses for loansAs discussed in Notes 3.6, 4.2, 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group recognized an allowance for credit losses using the 
Expected Credit Loss (ECL) impairment model for loans at amortized cost amounting to KRW 3,283,363 million as of December 31, 2020. A lifetime 
ECL is recognized for those loans that have experienced a Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) since initial recognition or are credit impaired, 
otherwise a 12-month ECL is recognized. The Group measures ECL allowances on an individual basis for individually significant corporate loans 
which are credit impaired and for those which have experienced a SICR and demonstrate certain other high risk indicators (for example, debt 
restructuring). The individual assessment involves judgment by the Group in estimating the future cash flows. The allowance for credit losses for 
other loans are measured on a collective basis. For these loans, the Group measures ECL based on its estimates of the Probability of Default (PD), 
the Loss Given Default (LGD) and the Exposure at Default (EAD) as well as the impact of Forward-Looking Information (FLI). For the corporateloans measured on a collective basis, one of the relevant inputs for determining PD is the internal credit risk rating of the borrower. The internal 
credit risk rating of the borrower is defined by the Group using quantitative and qualitative factors. The evaluation of the qualitative factors involves 
a high level of judgment by the Group.We identified the following risks in accordance with the assessment of the allowances for credit losses for loans as a key audit matter, considering 
likelihood of error, management judgement, and risk of material misstatement;∙  Risk that the Group’s estimation of future cash flows for the corporate loans to be individually assessed for ELC is inappropriate due to biasedjudgement∙  Risks that (i) the analysis of the qualitative factors in determining the internal credit risk ratings of the corporate loans to be collectively assessed 
for ELC is inappropriate; (ii) the calculation of 12 month and lifetime PD, the calculation of LGD, and the evaluation if FLI incorporated in the 
measurement of collective ECL is inappropriate due to fraud or errorThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter.∙  We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to: (i) the estimates of future cash flows for 
individually assessed corporate loans, including controls over the work of external valuation professionals engaged by the Group to assess the 
value of collateral; (ii) the validation of the models used to determine the inputs to the collective ECL calculation and the impact of FLI; (iii) the 
assessment of qualitative factors in the process of determining the internal credit risk rating of the loans, including the review of internal credit 
risk ratings performed by an independent department with access to the same qualitative information; and (iv) the completeness and accuracy of 
data used in the credit risk ratings.∙  We assessed the estimates of future cash flows on a sample of individually assessed corporate loans by (i) comparing assumptions made 
with information obtained from internal and external sources; and (ii) assessing the reliability of information used in the estimates, including the 
qualification of external valuation professionals engaged by the Group.∙  We involved credit risk and information technology professionals with specialized skills, industry knowledge and relevant experience who assisted 
in: (i) evaluating the methodology and key judgments used in determining the PD and LGD parameters; (ii) evaluating how FLI was incorporated in 
the collective ECL model; and (iii) recalculating forward-looking PD, and a sample of LGD.∙  We evaluated whether, for a sample of corporate loans with ECL measured on a collective basis, Group policy was applied in the internal creditrisk rating process.2. Internally measured fair value of level 3 derivatives, and level 3 derivative-linked securitiesAs discussed in Notes 3.3.2 and 6.1.2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group classifies financial instruments measured at fair value 
using valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market data as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
Those financial instruments measured at fair value classified as level 3 include derivatives and derivative-linked securities both held and issued by KB 
Securities Co., Ltd. (a subsidiary of the Group), of which fair value is measured by the internally developed valuation models. The fair value of such 
derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 was KRW 441,775 million and KRW 134,934 million, respectively. Also, the fair value of such 
derivative-linked securities held (presented as ‘financial assets at fair value through profit or loss – debt securities’) and issued (presented as 
‘financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss’) as of December 31, 2020 was KRW 635,920 million and KRW 9,201,431 million, 
respectively. In order to measure the fair value of these financial instruments, the Group uses valuation models such as discounted cash flow 
models and option models. These models use various inputs and assumptions, depending on the nature of the financial instruments.We identified the following risks in accordance with the measurement of fair value of the derivatives and derivativelinked securities as a key audit 
matter considering the level of judgement;∙  Risks that (i) the models used by the Group to value the level 3 financial instruments are inappropriate; (ii) the models’ significant inputs which 
are not directly observable in financial markets, (such as volatility of underlying assets, correlations, regression coefficients, discount rates, and 
growth rates) are inappropriateThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter.∙  We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the measurement of fair value of the 
derivatives and derivative-linked securities. This included controls related to (i) the development, validation and changes in the models used to value 
derivatives and derivative-linked securities, (ii) the development and application of the significant unobservable inputs and assumptions used in the 
measurement of fair values, and (iii) the monitoring of changes to these inputs and assumptions.∙  We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: (i) evaluating the valuation techniques and significant 
unobservable inputs on a selection of the derivatives and derivative-linked securities; and (ii) developing models and significant unobservable 
inputs independently for a selection of the derivatives and derivative-linked securities and comparing the resulting fair value estimates to the 
Group’s fair value measurements.Other Matters
The procedures and practices utilized in the Republic of Korea to audit such consolidated financial statements may differ from those generally 
accepted and applied in other countries.The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2019 were audited by another auditor who expressed an 
unmodified opinion on those financial statements on March 5, 2020.Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with K-IFRS, and 
for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the 
Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.∙  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether theconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.∙  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in the internal controls that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of 
the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Young-Min Kwon.Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with KSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.KPMG Samjong Accounting Corp.
Seoul, Korea
March 9, 2021As part of an audit in accordance with KSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:∙  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform 
audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.∙  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.∙  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the reasonableness ofaccounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.∙  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a goingThis report is effective as of March 9, 2021, the audit report date. Certain subsequent events or circumstances, which may occur between the audit 
report date and the time of reading this report, could have a material impact on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

The Parent CompanyKB Financial Group Inc. (the “Parent Company”) was incorporated on September 29, 2008, under the Financial Holding Companies Act of Korea. KB 
Financial Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) derive substantially all of their revenue and income from providing a broad range of banking 
and related financial services to consumers and corporations primarily in Korea and in selected international markets. The Parent Company’s principal 
business includes ownership and management of subsidiaries and associated companies that are engaged in financial services or activities. In 2011, 
Kookmin Bank spun off its credit card business segment and established a new separate credit card company, KB Kookmin Card Co., Ltd. and KB 
Investment & Securities Co., Ltd. merged with KB Futures Co., Ltd. The Group established KB Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in January 2012, acquired 
Yehansoul Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in September 2013, and KB Savings Bank Co., Ltd. merged with Yehansoul Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in January 2014. 
In March 2014, the Group acquired Woori Financial Co., Ltd. and changed the name to KB Capital Co., Ltd. Meanwhile, the Group included LIG 
Insurance Co., Ltd. as an associate and changed the name to KB Insurance Co., Ltd. in June 2015, and KB Insurance Co., Ltd. became one of the 
subsidiaries through a tender offer in May 2017. Also, the Group included Hyundai Securities Co., Ltd. as an associate in June 2016 and included as 
a subsidiary in October 2016 by comprehensive exchange of shares. Hyundai Securities Co., Ltd. merged with KB Investment & Securities Co., Ltd. in 
December 2016 and changed its name to KB Securities Co., Ltd. in January 2017. In August 2020, the Group acquired Prudential Life Insurance 
Company of Korea Ltd., which was classified as a subsidiary.The Parent Company’s share capital as of December 31, 2020, is ₩ 2,090,558 million. The Parent Company has been listed on the Korea Exchange 
(“KRX”) since October 10, 2008, and on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) for its American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) since September 29, 
2008. Number of shares authorized in its Articles of Incorporation is 1,000 million.2. Basis of Preparation2.1 Application of Korean IFRS
The Group maintains its accounting records in Korean won and prepares statutory consolidated financial statements in the Korean language in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the Republic of Korea (“Korean IFRS”). The accompanying consolidated 
financial statements have been translated into English from the Korean language consolidated financial statements.The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Korean IFRS. These are the standards and related 
interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) that have been adopted by the Republic of Korea.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. Management also needs to exercise 
judgment in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions 
and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 2.4.2.1.1 The Group has applied the following amended standards for the first time for its annual reporting period commencing January 1, 2020.-  Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1001 Presentation of Financial Statements and Korean IFRS No.1008 Accounting policies, changes in accountingestimates and errors – Definition of MaterialThe amendments clarify the definition of material. Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to 
influence the decisions that the primary users of general-purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements. These 
amendments do not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1103 Business Combination – Definition of a BusinessThe amended definition of a business requires an acquisition to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute 
to the ability to create outputs and the definition of output excludes the returns in the form of lower costs and other economic benefits. Ifsubstantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, an 
entity may elect to apply an optional concentration test that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is 
not a business. These amendments do not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. However, these amendments may 
have impact on the consolidated financial statements if business combination occurs in the future.2.1.2 The Group has early adopted the following amended standards.-  Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1107 Financial Instruments: Disclosure, Korean IFRS No.1109 Financial Instruments – Interest Rate BenchmarkReformThese amendments provide exceptions applying hedge accounting even though interest rate benchmark reform gives rise to uncertainties. In the 
hedging relationship, an entity shall assume that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedge cash flows are based is not altered as a result 
of interest rate benchmark reform when determining whether a forecast transaction is highly probable and prospectively assessing hedging 
effectiveness. For a hedge of a non-contractually specified benchmark component of interest rate risk, an entity shall apply the requirement that 
the risk component shall be separately identifiable only at the inception of the hedging relationship. The application of this exception is ceased 
either when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and the amount of the 
interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedge item, or when the hedging relationship that the hedge item is part of is discontinued. The 
Group early adopted these amendments since 2019 as the amendments allow the early adoption.The significant benchmark interest rate indicators for the hedge relationship are LIBOR and CD, and those affected by these amendments should 
be referred to Note 9.2.1.3  The following amended standards have been published that are not mandatory for December 31, 2020 reporting periods and have notbeen early adopted by the Group.- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1116 Leases – Practical expedient for COVID-19-Related Rent Exemption, Concessions, SuspensionAs a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a rent concession occurring as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic 
is a lease modification, and the amounts recognized in profit or loss as a result of applying this exemption should be disclosed. The amendments 
should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after June 1, 2020, and earlier application is permitted. The Group does not expect that these 
amendments have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.-  Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1109 Financial Instruments, Korean IFRS No.1039 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, Korean 
IFRS No.1107 Financial Instruments: Disclosure, Korean IFRS No.1104 Insurance Contracts and Korean IFRS No.1116 Lease – Interest Rate 
Benchmark ReformIn relation to interest rate benchmark reform, the amendments provide a practical expedient allowing entities to change the effective interest rate 
instead of changing the carrying amount and apply hedge accounting without discontinuance although the interest rate benchmark is replaced 
in hedging relationship. The amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021, and earlier application is 
permitted. The Group does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1103 Business Combination – Reference to the Conceptual FrameworkThe amendments update a reference of definition of assets and liabilities to qualify for recognition in revised Conceptual Framework for Financial 
Reporting. However, the amendments add an exception for the recognition of liabilities and contingent liabilities within the scope of Korean IFRS 
No.1037 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, and Korean IFRS No.2121 Levies. The amendments also confirm that contingent 
assets should not be recognized at the acquisition date. The amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 
1, 2022, and earlier application is permitted. The Group does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the consolidated 
financial statements.- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1016 Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before intended useThe amendments prohibit an entity from deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items 
produced while the entity is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, the entity will recognize the proceeds from selling such items, and 
the costs of producing those items, as profit or loss. The amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022, 
and earlier application is permitted. The Group does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the consolidated financial 
statements.- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1037 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets - Onerous Contracts: Cost of Fulfilling a ContractThe amendments clarify that the direct costs of fulfilling a contract include both the incremental costs of fulfilling the contract and an allocation of 
other costs directly related to fulfilling contracts when assessing whether the contract is onerous. The amendments should be applied for annual 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022, and earlier application is permitted. The Group does not expect that these amendments have a 
significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.- Annual improvements to Korean IFRS 2018-2020Annual improvements of Korean IFRS 2018-2020 Cycle should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022, and earlier 
application is permitted. The Group does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.∙  Korean IFRS No.1101 First time Adoption of Korean International Financial Reporting Standards – Subsidiaries that are first-time adopters∙  Korean IFRS No.1109 Financial Instruments – Fees related to the 10% test for derecognition of financial liabilities∙  Korean IFRS No.1116 Leases – Lease incentives∙ Korean IFRS No.1041 Agriculture – Measuring fair value- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1001 Presentation of Financial Statements - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-currentThe amendments clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, depending on the substantive rights that exist at the end of the 
reporting period. Classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise right to defer settlement of the liability or the management’s 
expectations thereof. Also, the settlement of liability includes the transfer of the entity’s own equity instruments; however, it would be excluded if an 
option to settle the liability by the transfer of the entity’s own equity instruments is recognized separately from the liability as an equity component 
of a compound financial instrument. The amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and earlier 
application is permitted. The Group does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.2.2 Measurement BasisThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on the historical cost accounting model unless otherwise specified.2.3 Functional and Presentation CurrencyItems included in the financial statements of each entity of the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the entity operates (“functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Korean won, which is the Parent Company’s 
functional and presentation currency.2.4 Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, certain critical accounting estimates and 
assumptions that may have a significant impact on the assets (liabilities) and incomes (expenses). Management’s estimates of outcomes may differ 
from actual outcomes if management’s estimates and assumptions based on management’s best judgment at the reporting date are different from 
the actual environment.Estimates and underlying assumptions are continually evaluated, and changes in accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the 
estimates are changed and in any future periods affected.Uncertainties in estimates and assumptions with significant risks that may result in material adjustments to the consolidated financial statements are 
as follows:2.4.1 Income taxesThe Group is operating in numerous countries and the income generated from these operations is subject to income taxes based on tax laws and 
interpretations of tax authorities in numerous jurisdictions. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain.If certain portion of the taxable income is not used for investments, wages, etc. in accordance with the Korean regulation called ‘Special Taxation 
for Facilitation of Investment and Mutually-beneficial Cooperation’, the Group is liable to pay additional income tax calculated based on the tax 
laws. Therefore, the effect of recirculation of corporate income should be reflected in current and deferred income tax. As the Group’s income tax isdependent on the actual investments, wages, etc. per each year, there are uncertainties with regard to measuring the final tax effects during the 
period when the tax law is applied.3.1 Consolidation3.1.1 Subsidiaries2.4.2 Fair value of financial instrumentsThe fair value of financial instruments where no active market exists or where quoted prices are not otherwise available is determined by using 
valuation techniques. Financial instruments, which are not actively traded in the market and those with less transparent market prices, will have less 
objective fair values and require broad judgment on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty in market factors and assumptions in fair value determination 
and other risks.As described in the significant accounting policies in Note 3.3, ‘Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments’, diverse valuation techniques 
are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, from generally accepted market valuation models to internally developed valuation 
models that incorporate various types of assumptions and variables.2.4.3 Allowances and provisions for credit lossesThe Group recognizes and measures allowances for credit losses of debt instruments measured at amortized cost, debt instruments measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income, and lease receivables. Also, the Group recognizes and measures provisions for credit losses of acceptances and 
guarantees, and unused loan commitments. Accuracy of allowances and provisions for credit losses is dependent upon estimation of expected cash flows 
of the borrower for individually assessed loans, and upon assumptions and methodology used for collectively assessed groups of loans, acceptances and 
guarantees and unused loan commitments.2.4.4 Net defined benefit liabilityThe present value of the net defined benefit liability is affected by changes in the various factors determined by the actuarial method.2.4.5 Impairment of goodwillThe recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are determined based on value-in-use calculations to test whether impairment of goodwill has 
occurred.2.4.6 Estimated claims for Incurred But Not Reported (“IBNR”)An amount of IBNR is the total sum of estimated insurance claims that shall be paid for accidents that occurred but have not been reported to the 
Group and the estimated amount of insurance proceeds that shall be additionally paid upon resumption of payment claims. The Group calculates IBNR 
by applying statistical methods in risk units designated in Detailed Regulations on Supervision of Insurance Business, and records IBNR in reserve for 
outstanding claims of insurance liability. IBNR based on statistical methods requires significant accounting estimates in determining appropriate model 
applied by accident year (PLDM, ILDM, BFM, and others) and development parameters.2.4.7 Assessment of expected credit losses of financial instruments related to COVID-19The proliferation of COVID-19 in 2020 negatively affected the global economy, despite of various forms of government support policy. Accordingly, the 
Group was provided with various economic forecasting scenarios from KB Research, assuming macroeconomic changes due to the level of COVID-19 
pandemic. The Group reviewed the possibilities of each scenario comprehensively, updated the forward-looking information, and reflected its effect on 
expected credit losses through the statistical method. In order to reflect additional credit risk for financial assets whose industries are highly affected 
by COVID-19, the Group measured expected credit losses using a conservative scenario comparing to the forecasted forward-looking information and 
proactively responded to the credit risk to be increased in the future by expanding the scope of loans subject to lifetime expected credit losses (non-
impaired) and expanding the scope of loans subject to individual assessment. The Group will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the 
expected credit losses by comprehensively considering the duration of the impact on the entire economy and the government’s policies.3. Significant Accounting PoliciesThe principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.For the comparative purpose, certain information in the notes for the year ended December 31, 2019 have been reclassified to conform to the 
presentation for the year ended December 31, 2020.Subsidiaries are companies that are controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Also, the existence and 
effects of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls the 
investee. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date when control is transferred to the Group and deconsolidated from the date when control 
is lost.If a subsidiary uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar 
circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to that subsidiary’s financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements to 
ensure conformity with the Group’s accounting policies.Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Parent Company and to the non-controlling 
interests, if any. Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the Parent Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results 
in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions (i.e. transactions with 
owners in their capacity as owners). The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and carrying amount of the subsidiary’s net 
assets attributable to the additional interests acquired, is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also 
recorded in equity.When the Group loses control, any investment retained in the former subsidiary is recognized at its fair value at the date when control is lost, 
with the resulting difference recognized in profit or loss. This fair value will be the fair value on initial recognition of a financial asset in accordance 
with Korean IFRS No.1109 or, when appropriate, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or joint venture. In addition, all 
amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted on the same basis as would be required 
if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. Therefore, amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are 
reclassified to profit or loss.The Group accounts for each business combination by applying the acquisition method. The consideration transferred is measured at fair value, and 
identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially measured at acquisition-date fair 
values. For each business combination, the Group measures non-controlling interests in the acquiree that entitle their holders to a proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s net assets in the event of liquidation at either (a) fair value or (b) the proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred.In a business combination achieved in stages, the Group shall remeasure its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date 
fair value and recognize the resulting gain or loss, if any, in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, as appropriate. In prior reporting periods, 
the Group may have recognized changes in the value of its equity interest in the acquiree in other comprehensive income. If so, the amount that 
was recognized in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified as profit or loss, or retained earnings, on the same basis as would be required if 
the Group had disposed directly of the previously held equity interest.The Group applies the book amount method to account for business combinations of entities under a common control. Identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their book amounts on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
In addition, the difference between (a) the sum of consolidated net book amounts of the assets and liabilities transferred and accumulated other 
comprehensive income and (b) the consideration paid is recognized as capital surplus.3.1.2 Associates and joint venturesAssociates are entities over which the Group has significant influence over the financial and operating policy decisions. Generally, if the Group 
holds 20% or more of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the Group has significant influence.Joint ventures are investments in which the Group jointly controls over economic activities pursuant to contractual arrangement. Decisions about 
financial and operating policies require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.Investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognized at cost and equity method is applied after initial recognition. The carrying 
amount is increased or decreased to recognize the Group’s share of the profit or loss of the investee and changes in the investee’s equity after the 
date of acquisition. Distributions received from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from 
transactions between the Group and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s share in associates. If unrealized losses are indication of 
an impairment loss that which should be recognized in the consolidated financial statements, those losses are recognized for the period.If associates and joint ventures use accounting policies other than those of the Group for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, if 
necessary, adjustments shall be made to make the associates’ accounting policies conform to those of the Group when the associates’ financial 
statements are used by the Group in applying the equity method.If the Group’s share of losses of associates and joint ventures equals or exceeds its interest in the associates (including long-term interests that, 
in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate), the Group discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. After the 
Group’s interest is reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognized, only to the extent that the Group has incurred 
legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associates.The Group determines at each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the investments in the associates are impaired. If this 
is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associates and its carrying 
value and recognizes the amount as non-operating income (expenses) in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.3.1.3 Structured entityA structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the 
entity. When the Group decides whether it has power over the structured entities in which the Group has interests, it considers factors such as the 
purpose, the form, the substantive ability to direct the relevant activities of a structured entity, the nature of its relationship with a structured entity 
and the amount of exposure to variable returns.3.1.4 Funds managementThe Group manages and operates trust assets, collective investment and other funds on behalf of investors. These trusts and funds are not 
consolidated, except for trusts and funds over which the Group has control.3.1.5 Intragroup transactionsIntragroup balances, income, expenses and any unrealized gains and losses resulting from intragroup transactions are eliminated in full, 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements. If unrealized losses are indication of an impairment loss which should be recognized in the 
consolidated financial statements, those losses are recognized for the period.3.2 Foreign Currency3.2.1 Foreign currency transactionsA foreign currency transaction is recorded, at initial recognition in the functional currency, by applying to the foreign currency amount the spot 
exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting period, 
foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate which is the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-
monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value was 
measured and non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the 
date of the transaction.Except for the exchange difference for the net investment in a foreign operation and the financial liability designated as a hedging instrument of net 
investment, exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items is recognized in profit or loss. When 
gain or loss on a nonmonetary item is recognized in other comprehensive income, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognized in 
other comprehensive income, conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in profit or loss, any exchange component of 
that gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss.3.2.2 Foreign operationsThe results and financial position of a foreign operation, whose functional currency differs from the Group’s presentation currency, are translated 
into the Group’s presentation currency based on the following procedures.If the functional currency of a foreign operation is not the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, assets and liabilities for each statement of 
financial position presented (including comparatives) are translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting period, income and expenses 
for each statement of comprehensive income presented (including comparatives) are translated using the average exchange rates for the period. All 
resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising 
on the acquisition of that foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation. Thus, they are expressed in the functionalcurrency of the foreign operation and are translated into the presentation currency at the closing rate.On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation, recognized in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the separate component of equity, is reclassified from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification 
adjustment) when the gain or loss on disposal is recognized. On the partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the Group 
reattributes the proportionate share of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognized in other comprehensive income to the non-
controlling interests in that foreign operation. In any other partial disposal of a foreign operation, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss only the 
proportionate share of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognized in other comprehensive income.3.2.3 Translation of the net investment in a foreign operationA monetary item that is receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the 
foreseeable future is, in substance, a part of the Group’s net investment in that foreign operation, then foreign currency difference arising from that 
monetary item is recognized in the other comprehensive income and shall be reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.3.3 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments3.3.1 Initial recognitionThe Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability in its consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets (a purchase or sale of a financial asset under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the asset within the time frame established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned) is 
recognized and derecognized using trade date accounting.For financial reporting purpose, the Group classifies (a) financial assets as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets at 
fair value through other comprehensive income, or financial assets at amortized cost and (b) financial liabilities as financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss, or other financial liabilities. These classifications are based on business model for managing financial instruments and the 
contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial instrument at initial recognition.At initial recognition, a financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability 
not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability. 
The fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants. The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (that is, the fair value of the consideration 
given or received) in an arm’s length transaction.3.3.2 Subsequent measurementAfter initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at amortized cost or fair value based on classification at initial recognition.3.3.2.1 Amortized costThe amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial 
recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference 
between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance.3.3.2.2 Fair valueThe Group uses quoted price in active market which is based on listed market price or dealer price quotations of financial instruments traded in active 
market as best estimate of fair value. A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly 
available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly 
occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis.If there is no active market for a financial instrument, fair value is determined either by using a valuation technique or independent third-
party valuation service. Valuation techniques include using recent arm’s length market transactions between knowledgeable and willing parties, if 
available, referencing to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing 
models.The Group uses valuation models that are commonly used by market participants and customized for the Group to determine fair values of 
common over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives such as options, interest rate swaps and currency swaps which are based on the inputs observablein markets. For more complex instruments, the Group uses internally developed models, which are usually based on valuation methods and 
techniques generally used within the industry, or a value measured by an independent external valuation institution as the fair values if all or some 
of the inputs to the valuation models are not observable in market and therefore it is necessary to estimate fair value based on certain assumptions.In addition, the fair value information recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position is classified into the following fair value hierarchy, 
reflecting the significance of the input variables used in the fair value measurement.Level 1 : Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the measurement date
Level 2 : Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly
Level 3 : Unobservable inputs for the asset or liabilityThe fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to 
the entire measurement. For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety.If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment using unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 
measurement.If the valuation technique does not reflect all factors which market participants would consider in pricing the asset or liability, the fair value is 
adjusted to reflect those factors. Those factors include counterparty credit risk, bid-ask spread, liquidity risk and others.The Group uses valuation technique which maximizes the use of market inputs and minimizes the use of entity-specific inputs. It incorporates all 
factors that market participants would consider in pricing the asset or liability and is consistent with economic methodologies applied for pricing 
financial instruments. Periodically, the Group calibrates the valuation technique and tests its validity using prices of observable current market 
transactions of the same instrument or based on other relevant observable market data.3.3.3 DerecognitionDerecognition is the removal of a previously recognized financial asset or financial liability from the consolidated statement of financial position. 
The derecognition criteria for financial assets and financial liabilities are as follows:3.3.3.1 Derecognition of financial assetsA financial asset is derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or the Group transfers substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, or the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset and the Group has not retained control. Therefore, if the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the financial asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the 
financial asset.If the Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset but retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset in its entirety and recognize a financial liability for the 
consideration received.The Group writes off a financial asset when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion 
thereof. In general, the Group considers write-off when it is determined that the debtor does not have sufficient funds or income to cover the 
principal and interest. The write-off decision is made in accordance with internal regulations. After the write-off, the Group can collect the written-off 
loans continuously according to the internal policy. Recovered amounts from financial assets previously written-off are recognized in profit or loss.3.3.3.2 Derecognition of financial liabilitiesA financial liability is derecognized from the consolidated statement of financial position when it is extinguished (i.e. the obligation specified in the 
contract is discharged, cancelled or expires).3.3.4 OffsettingA financial asset and a financial liability is offset and the net amount is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position when, and 
only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to 
realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on a future event and must be legally 
enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group and all of the counterparties.3.4 Cash and Due from Financial InstitutionsCash and due from financial institutions include cash on hand, foreign currency, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible 
to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and due from financial institutions. Cash and due from 
financial institutions are measured at amortized cost.3.5 Non-derivative Financial Assets3.5.1 Financial assets at fair value through profit or lossFinancial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss unless they are classified as financial assets at amortized cost or 
at fair value through other comprehensive income.The Group may designate certain financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss when the designation eliminates or 
significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as ‘an accounting mismatch’) that would otherwise arise 
from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on different bases.After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is measured at fair value and gains or losses arising from a change in 
fair value are recognized in profit or loss. Interest income using the effective interest method and dividend income from financial asset at fair value 
through profit or loss are also recognized in profit or loss.3.5.2 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive incomeThe Group classifies below financial assets as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income;-  Debt instruments that are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financialassets, and where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and;-  Equity instruments that are not held for short-term trading but held for strategic investment, and designated as financial assets at fair valuethrough other comprehensive incomeAfter initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income is measured at fair value. Gains or losses arising from a 
change in fair value, other than dividend income, interest income calculated using the effective interest method and exchange differences arising 
on monetary items which are recognized directly in profit or loss, are recognized as other comprehensive income in equity.When the financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is disposed, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other 
comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss. However, cumulative gain or loss of equity instrument designated as fair value 
through other comprehensive income is reclassified to retained earnings not to profit or loss at disposal.A financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income denominated in foreign currency is translated at the closing rate. Exchange 
difference resulting from change in amortized cost is recognized in profit or loss, and other changes are recognized in equity.3.5.3 Financial assets at amortized costA financial asset, which is held within the business model whose objective is achieved by collecting contractual cash flows, and where the assets’ 
cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, is classified as a financial asset at amortized 
cost. After initial recognition, a financial asset at amortized cost is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method and interest 
income is calculated using the effective interest method.3.6 Expected Credit Loss of Financial Assets (Debt Instruments)The Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses at the end of the reporting period for financial assets at amortized cost and fair 
value through other comprehensive income except for financial asset at fair value through profit or loss.Expected credit losses are estimated at present value of probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible 
outcomes. The Group measures expected credit losses by reflecting all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost 
or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.The approaches of measuring expected credit losses in accordance with Korean IFRS are as follows:- General approach: for financial assets and unused loan commitments not subject to the below 2 approaches
- Simplified approach: for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables
- Credit-impaired approach: for financial assets that are credit-impaired at the time of acquisitionApplication of general approach is differentiated depending on whether credit risk has increased significantly after initial recognition. If the credit 
risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial 
instrument at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses, whereas if the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly 
since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. 
Lifetime is presumed to be a period to the contractual maturity date of financial assets (the expected life of financial assets).The Group assesses whether the credit risk has increased significantly using the following information, and if one or more of the following 
conditions are met, it is deemed as significant increase in credit risk. Information of more than 30 days overdue is applied to all subsidiaries, and 
other information is applied selectively considering specific indicators of each subsidiary or additionally considering specific indicators of each 
subsidiary. If the contractual cash flows on a financial asset have been renegotiated or modified, the Group assesses whether the credit risk has 
increased significantly using the same following information.- More than 30 days past due
- Decline in credit rating at period end by more than certain notches as compared to that at initial recognition
- Subsequent managing ratings below certain level in the early warning system
- Debt restructuring (except for impaired financial assets) and
- Credit delinquency information of Korea Federation of Banks, etc.Under simplified approach, the Group always measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Under credit-
impaired approach, the Group only recognizes the cumulative changes in lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition as a loss allowance 
for purchased or originated creditimpaired financial assets. In assessing credit impairment, the Group uses definition of default as in the new Basel 
Accord which rules calculation of Capital Adequacy Ratio.The Group generally considers the loan to be credit-impaired if one or more of the following conditions are met:- 90 days or more past due
- Legal proceedings related to collection
- A borrower registered on the credit management list of Korea Federation of Banks
- A corporate borrower with the credit rating C or D
- Refinancing
- Debt restructuring, etc.3.6.1 Forward-looking informationThe Group uses forward-looking information, when it assesses whether the credit risk has increased significantly and measures the expected credit 
losses.The Group assumes the risk components have a certain correlation with the economic cycle and uses statistical methodologies to estimate the 
relation between key macroeconomic variables and risk components for the expected credit losses.The correlation between the major macroeconomic variables and the credit risk are as follows:Forward-looking information used in calculation of expected credit losses is based on the macroeconomic forecasts utilized by the management 
of the Group for its business plan considering reliable external agency’s forecasts and others. The forward-looking information is generated by 
KB Research with comprehensive approach to capture the possibility of various economic forecast scenarios that are derived from the internal 
and external viewpoints of the macroeconomic situation. The Group determines the macroeconomic variables to be used in forecasting future 
condition of the economy, considering the direction of the forecast scenario and the significant relationship between macroeconomic variables 
and time series data. And there are some changes compared to the macroeconomic variables used in the previous year.In order to reflect additional credit risk for financial assets whose industries are highly affected by COVID-19, the Group measures expected credit 
losses using a conservative scenario comparing to the forecasted forward-looking information.3.6.2 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at amortized costThe expected credit losses of financial assets at amortized cost are measured as present value of the difference between the contractual cash 
flows that are due to the Group under the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive. The Group estimates expected future cash 
flows for financial assets that are individually significant (individual assessment of impairment).For financial assets that are not individually significant, the Group collectively estimates expected credit loss by grouping loans with homogeneous 
credit risk profile (collective assessment of impairment).3.6.2.1 Individual assessment of impairmentIndividual assessment of impairment losses is calculated using management’s best estimate on present value of expected future cash flows. The 
Group uses all the available information including financial condition of the borrower such as operating cash flow and net realizable value of any 
collateral held.3.6.2.2 Collective assessment of impairmentCollective assessment of impairment losses is performed by using a methodology based on historical loss experience and reflecting forward-
looking information. Such process incorporates factors such as type of collateral, product and borrowers, credit rating, size of portfolio and 
recovery period and applies Probability of Default (“PD”) on a group of assets and Loss Given Default (“LGD”) by type of recovery method. Also, 
the expected credit loss model involves certain assumptions to determine input based on loss experience and forward-looking information. These 
models and assumptions are periodically reviewed to reduce gap between loss estimate and actual loss experience.The lifetime expected credit loss is measured by applying the PD to the carrying amount calculated by deducting the expected principal repayment 
amount from the carrying amount as of the reporting date and the LGD adjusted to reflect changes in the carrying amount.3.6.3 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive incomeThe Group measures expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income in a manner that is consistent 
with the requirements that are applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost. However, the loss allowance is recognized in other 
comprehensive income. Upon disposal or repayment of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, the amount of the loss 
allowance is reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss.Key macroeconomic variablesCorrelation between the major macroeconomicvariables and the credit risk3.7 Derivative Financial InstrumentsDomestic GDP growth rate

(-)The Group enters into numerous derivative financial instrument contracts such as currency forwards, interest rate swaps, currency swaps and others 
for trading purposes or to manage its exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange, amongst others. The Group’s derivative 
operations focus on addressing the needs of the Group’s corporate clients to hedge their risk exposure and to hedge the Group’s risk exposure 
that results from such client contracts. These derivative financial instruments are presented as derivative financial instruments in the consolidated 
financial statements irrespective of transaction purpose and subsequent measurement requirement.The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an 
unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge) and the risk of changes in cash flow (cash flow hedge). The Group designates certain derivatives 
and non-derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of foreign exchange of the net investment in a foreign operation (hedge of net 
investment).At the inception of the hedging relationship, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the Group’s risk 
management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. This documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged 
item, the nature of the risk being hedged, the inception date of hedging relationship and how the Group will assess the hedging instrument’s 
effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value. After initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are 
accounted for as described below.3.8 Property and Equipment3.8.1 Recognition and measurement3.7.1 Derivative financial instruments held for tradingAll derivative financial instruments, except for derivatives that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, are measured at fair value. Gains or 
losses arising from changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss as part of net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through 
profit or loss.3.7.2 Derivative financial instruments for fair value hedgesIf derivatives are designated and qualify for a fair value hedge, changes in fair value of the hedging instrument and changes in fair value of the 
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in profit or loss as part of other operating income and expenses. If the hedged items 
are equity instruments for which the Group has elected to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income, changes in fair value of the 
hedging instrument and changes in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in other comprehensive income. 
Fair value hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the hedging 
relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. Once fair value hedge accounting is discontinued, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a 
hedged item is amortized to profit or loss by the maturity of the financial instrument using the effective interest method.3.7.3 Derivative financial instruments for cash flow hedgesThe effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive 
income, limited to the cumulative change in fair value (present value) of the hedged item (the present value of the cumulative change in the 
hedged expected future cash flows) from inception of the hedge. The ineffective portion is recognized in profit or loss as other operating income 
or expense. The associated gains or losses that were previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified from equity to profit 
or loss (other operating income or expense) as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast cash 
flows affect profit or loss. Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised, or the hedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. When the cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, the cumulative 
gains or losses on the hedging instrument that have been recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss over the 
period in which the forecast transaction occurs. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses that 
have been recognized in other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.3.7.4 Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments designated for net investments hedgesIf derivatives and non-derivatives are designated and qualify for the net investment hedge, the effective portion of changes in fair value of hedging 
instrument is recognized in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognized in profit or loss as other operating income and 
expense. The cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge that has been accumulated in 
other comprehensive income will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment on the disposal 
or partial disposal of the foreign operation.3.7.5 Embedded derivativesAn embedded derivative is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative if, and only if, (a) the economic characteristics 
and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract, (b) a separate instrument with the same terms as the 
embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative and (c) the hybrid contract contains a host that is not a financial asset and is not 
designated as at fair value through profit or loss. Gains or losses arising from a change in fair value of an embedded derivative separated from the 
host contract are recognized in profit or loss as part of net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.3.7.6 Day one gains or lossesIf the Group uses a valuation technique that incorporates unobservable inputs for the fair value of the OTC derivatives at initial recognition, 
there may be a difference between the transaction price and the amount determined using that valuation technique. In these circumstances, the 
difference is not recognized in profit or loss but deferred and amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the financial instrument. If 
the fair value is subsequently determined using observable inputs, the remaining deferred amount is recognized in profit or loss as part of net gains 
or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss or other operating income and expenses.All property and equipment that qualify for recognition as an asset are measured at cost and subsequently carried at its cost less any accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.The cost of property and equipment includes any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to 
be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and 
restoring the site on which it is located.Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when they prolong the useful life or enhance values of the assets but the costs of the day-to-day 
servicing of the assets such as repair and maintenance costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. When part of an item of property and 
equipment has a useful life different from that of the entire asset, it is recognized as a separate asset.3.8.2 DepreciationLand is not depreciated, whereas other property and equipment are depreciated using the method that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s 
future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group. The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its 
residual value.Each part of an item of property and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.The depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows:Property and equipmentDepreciation methodEstimated useful livesBuildings and structures

Equipment and vehiclesStraight-lineDeclining-balance/ Straight-line

4~15 years
3~15 yearsThe residual value, the useful life and the depreciation method applied to an asset are reviewed at each financial year-end and, if expectations 
differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.9 Investment Properties3.9.1 Recognition and measurementProperties held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both are classified as investment properties. Investment properties are measured 
initially at their cost and subsequently the cost model is used.3.9.2 DepreciationLand is not depreciated, whereas other investment properties are depreciated using the method that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s future 
economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group. The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual 
value.The depreciation method and estimated useful lives of investment properties are as follows:Investment propertiesBuildingsDepreciation methodStraight-lineEstimated useful lives20~40 yearsThe residual value, the useful life and the depreciation method applied to an asset are reviewed at each financial year-end and, if expectations 
differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.10 Intangible Assets3.10.3 Subsequent expenditureIntangible assets are measured initially at cost and subsequently carried at their cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated 
impairment losses.Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it enhances values of the assets. Internally generated intangible assets, such as goodwill and trade 
name, are not recognized as assets but expensed as incurred.Intangible assets, except for goodwill and membership rights, are amortized using the straight-line method or declining-balance method with no 
residual value over their estimated useful economic life since the asset is available for use.3.11 Impairment of Non-financial AssetsIntangible assetsIndustrial property rightsSoftwareVOBA

1 ~ 13 yearsThe amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year-
end. Where an intangible asset is not being amortized because its useful life is indefinite, the Group carries out a review in each accounting 
period to confirm whether events and circumstances still support an indefinite useful life assessment. If they do not, the change in the useful life 
assessment from indefinite to finite is accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.10.1 Value of business acquired (“VOBA”)In case of acquisition of insurance company, the Group recognized the difference amount as VOBA in intangible assets, if the fair value of the 
acquired insurance liability is less than the carrying amount based on the acquiree’s accounting policy, and in the opposite case, the difference 
amount is recognized as negative VOBA and included in premium reserve. VOBA is an estimated present value of future cash flow of insurance 
contracts at the acquisition date. VOBA is amortized over the above estimated useful lives using declining balance method, and the depreciation is 
recognized as insurance expense.3.10.2 Goodwill3.10.2.1 Recognition and measurementGoodwill related to business combinations before January 1, 2010, is stated at its carrying amount, which was recognized under the Group’s 
previous accounting policy, prior to the transition to Korean IFRS.Goodwill acquired from business combinations after January 1, 2010, is initially measured as the excess of cost of the business combination over 
the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
exceeds cost of business combination, the difference is recognized in profit or loss.For each business combination, the Group decides at the acquisition date whether the non-controlling interests in the acquiree is initially measured 
at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.Acquisition-related costs incurred to effect a business combination are charged to expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the 
services are received, except for the costs to issue debt or equity securities.3.10.2.2 Additional acquisitions of non-controlling interestsThe Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset, except for (a) deferred income 
tax assets, (b) assets arising from employee benefits and (c) non-current assets (or group of assets to be sold) classified as held for sale, may be 
impaired. If any such indication exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. However, irrespective of whether there is any 
indication of impairment, the Group tests (a) goodwill acquired in a business combination, (b) intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and (c) 
intangible assets not yet available for use for impairment annually by comparing their carrying amount with their recoverable amount.The recoverable amount is estimated for the individual asset. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, 
the Group determines the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. A cash-generating unit is the smallest 
identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. 
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the 
future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit that are discounted by a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. That 
reduction is an impairment loss and recognized immediately in profit or loss. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to each of the cash-generating units that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The impairment 
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cashgenerating unit and then to the other assets of the unit 
pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period 
whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset, other than goodwill, may no longer exist or may 
have decreased, and an impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill shall be reversed if, and only if, there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The increased carrying 
amount of an asset other than goodwill attributable to a reversal of an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.3.12 Non-current Assets Held for SaleA non-current asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present 
condition and its sale must be highly probable. A non-current asset (or disposal group) classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of (a) 
its carrying amount measured in accordance with the applicable Korean IFRS, immediately before the initial classification of the asset (or disposal 
group) as held for sale and (b) fair value less costs to sell.A non-current asset while it is classified as held for sale or while it is part of a disposal group classified as held for sale is not depreciated (or 
amortized).Impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. Gain is 
recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of the cumulative impairment loss that has been 
recognized.Additional acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as equity transactions. Therefore, no additional goodwill is recognized.3.13 Financial Liabilities3.10.2.3 Subsequent measurementGoodwill is not amortized and is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. However, goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of 
an investment in associates is not separately recognized and an impairment loss recognized is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, which 
forms part of the carrying amount of the investment in the associates.The Group classifies financial liabilities into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities in accordance with the 
substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of financial liabilities. The Group recognizes financial liabilities in the consolidated 
statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial liability.3.13.1 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or lossFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading or designated as such at initial recognition. After 
initial recognition, financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognized in profit or 
loss. At initial recognition, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.In relation to securities lending or borrowing transactions, when the Group borrows securities from the Korea Securities Depository and others, 
these transactions are managed as off-balance sheet items. The borrowed securities are treated as financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss when they are sold. Changes in fair value at the end of the reporting period and difference between carrying amount at redemption and 
purchased amount are recognized as profit or loss.In addition, the change in fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to change in the credit risk of that liability, the Group presents 
this change in other comprehensive income, and does not recycle this to profit or loss in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1109. However, if this 
treatment creates or enlarges an accounting mismatch, the Group recognizes this change in profit or loss.3.13.2 Other financial liabilitiesNon-derivative financial liabilities other than financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are classified as other financial liabilities. Other 
financial liabilities include deposits, borrowings, debentures and others. At initial recognition, other financial liabilities are measured at fair value 
minus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition. After initial recognition, other financial liabilities are measured at amortized 
cost, and its interest expense is recognized, using the effective interest method.In case an asset is sold under repurchase agreement, the Group continues to recognize the asset with the amount sold being accounted for as 
borrowing. The Group derecognizes a financial liability from the consolidated statement of financial position only when it is extinguished (i.e. when 
the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires).3.14 Insurance ContractsKB Insurance Co., Ltd., KB Life Insurance Co., Ltd. and Prudential Life Insurance Company of Korea Ltd., the subsidiaries of the Group, issue insurance 
contracts.Insurance contracts are defined as “a contract under which one party (the insurer) accepts significant insurance risk from another party by agreeing 
to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder”. A contract that qualifies as an insurance 
contract remains an insurance contract until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire. Such a contract that does not contain significant 
insurance risk is classified as an investment contract and is within the scope of Korean IFRS No.1109 Financial Instruments to the extent that it gives 
rise to a financial asset or financial liability, except if the investment contract contains a Discretionary Participation Features (DPF). If the contract 
has a DPF, the contract is subject to Korean IFRS No.1104 Insurance Contracts. The Group recognizes assets (liabilities) and gains (losses) relating 
to insurance contracts as other assets (liabilities) in the consolidated statement of financial position, and as other operating income (expenses) in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, respectively.3.14.1 Insurance premiumsThe Group recognizes collected premiums as revenue on the due date of collection of premiums from insurance contracts and the collected 
premium which is not earned at the end of the reporting period is recognized as unearned premium.3.14.2 Insurance liabilitiesThe Group recognizes a liability for future claims, refunds, policyholders’ dividends and related expenses as follows:3.14.2.4 Reserve for dividend to policyholdersReserve for dividend to policyholders including dividend of interest rate differential, rate of risk differential and business expenses differential is 
recognized for the purpose of provisioning for policyholders’ dividends in the future in accordance with statutes or insurance terms and conditions.3.14.3 Liability adequacy testThe Group conducts a liability adequacy test for all contracts to which Korean IFRS No.1104 Insurance Contracts apply, in consideration of current 
estimates of all cash inflows and cash outflows from the insurance contracts at the end of the reporting period including options, guarantees, 
claims survey costs and policy loans. If the assessment shows that the carrying amount of its insurance liabilities is insufficient in light of the 
estimated adequate liabilities, additional reserve is recognized for the deficient amount.Future cash flows from long-term insurance are discounted at interest rate scenario, which is risk-free rate scenario adjusted by liquidity premium, 
whereas future cash flows from general insurance are not discounted to present value. In case of insurance premium and unearned premium 
reserves, all future cash flows such as payment of claims, administration expenses and premium received from policyholders are considered for the 
liability adequacy test. And in case of reserve for outstanding claims, the adequacy of individually assessed payment of claims is tested by applying 
models that are considered appropriate for claim development trend among various statistical methods.3.14.4 Deferred acquisition costsThe Group recognizes acquisition cost incurred by the long-term insurance contract as an asset and amortizes it evenly over the premium payment 
period. If the premium payment period exceeds seven years, the amortization period shall be seven years. If the insurance contract is surrendered 
or lapsed due to payment overdue, the remaining balances of deferred acquisition cost are fully amortized in the period in which the contract is 
surrendered or lapsed.3.15 ProvisionsProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching the 
best estimate of provisions, and where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of provisions is the present value of the 
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.Provisions for confirmed and unconfirmed acceptances and guarantees, and unused credit lines of consumer and corporate loans are recognized 
using a valuation model that applies the credit conversion factor, probability of default, and loss given default.Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provisions are reversed.An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits 
expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower 
of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfill it. If the Group has a contract that is onerous, the present 
obligation under the contract is recognized and measured as provisions.3.14.2.1 Premium reserve3.16 Financial Guarantee ContractsPremium reserve refers to an amount based on the net premium method for payment of future claims with respect to events covered by insurance 
policies which have not yet occurred as of the reporting period. It is calculated as the greater of the amount using standard interest rate and 
standard loss ratio defined by Financial Supervisory Services and the amount using the actual underlying data that have been used in premium 
calculation.3.14.2.2 Reserve for outstanding claimsReserve for outstanding claims refers to the amount not yet paid, out of an amount to be paid or expected to be paid with respect to the insured 
events which have arisen as of the end of each fiscal year.3.14.2.3 Unearned premium reserveReserve for the insurance premiums that are due during the reporting period but not earned at the end of the period.A financial guarantee contract requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified 
debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.Financial guarantee contracts are initially recognized at fair value and classified as other liabilities and are amortized over the contractual term. 
After initial recognition, financial guarantee contracts are measured at the higher of:- The amount determined in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1109 Financial Instruments and
-  The amount initially recognized less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognized in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1115Revenue from Contracts with Customers.3.17 Equity Instrument Issued by the GroupAn equity instrument is any contract or agreement that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.3.17.1 Ordinary shares3.18.2 Fee and commission incomeOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or the exercise of stock option are 
deducted from the equity, net of any tax effects.The Group recognizes financial service fees in accordance with the purpose of charging the fees and the accounting standards of the financial 
instrument related to the fees earned.3.17.2 Hybrid securities3.18.2.1 Fees that are an integral part of the effective interest of a financial instrumentThe financial instruments can be classified as either financial liabilities or equity in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Group classifies 
hybrid securities as an equity if the Group has the unconditional right to avoid any contractual obligation to deliver financial assets such as cash 
in relation to the financial instruments. However, hybrid securities issued by subsidiaries are classified as non-controlling interests, dividends are 
recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as profit attributable to non-controlling interests.3.17.3 Treasury sharesIf the Group acquires its own equity instruments, these are accounted for as treasury shares and are deducted directly from equity. No gains or 
losses are recognized in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or retirement of own equity instruments. If an entity within the Group acquires 
and retains treasury shares, the consideration paid or received is directly recognized in equity.3.17.4 Compound financial instrumentsA compound financial instrument is classified as a financial liability or an equity instrument depending on the substance of the contractual 
arrangement of such financial instrument. The liability component of the compound financial instrument is measured at fair value of the similar 
liability without conversion option at initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortized cost using effective interest method until it is 
extinguished by conversion or matured. Equity component is initially measured at fair value of compound financial instrument in its entirety less fair 
value of liability component net of tax effect and it is not remeasured subsequently.3.18 Revenue RecognitionThe Group recognizes revenues in accordance with the following steps determined in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1115 Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers.- Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer.
- Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
- Step 3: Determine the transaction price.
- Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
- Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.Such fees are generally treated as adjustments of effective interest. Such fees may include compensation for activities such as evaluating the 
borrower’s financial condition, evaluating and recording guarantees, collateral and other security arrangements, negotiating the terms of the 
instrument, preparing and processing documents and closing the transaction and origination fees received on issuing financial liabilities at 
amortized cost. However, fees relating to the creation or acquisition of a financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss are recognized as 
revenue immediately.3.18.2.2 Fees related to performance obligations satisfied over timeThe Group transfers control of a good or service over time, therefore, recognizes revenue related to performance obligations satisfied over 
the period of performance obligations. Fees which can be earned through the certain periods, including asset management fees, consignment 
business fees, etc. are recognized over the period of performance obligations.3.18.2.3 Fees related to performance obligations satisfied at a point in timeFees earned at a point in time are recognized as revenue when a customer obtains controls of a promised good or service and the Group satisfies 
a performance obligation.Commission on negotiation or participation in negotiation for the third party such as trading stocks or other securities, arranging merger and 
acquisition of business, is recognized as revenue when the transaction has been completed.A syndication arrangement fees recognized as revenue when the syndication has been completed, if the Group arranges a loan and retains no 
part of the loan package for itself (or retains a part at the same effective interest rate for comparable risk as other participants).3.18.3 Net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or lossNet gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (including changes in fair value, dividends, and gains or losses from 
foreign currency translation) include gains and losses from following financial instruments:- Gains or losses relating to financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (excluding interest income using the effective interest rate)
- Gains or losses relating to derivatives for trading (including derivatives for hedging purpose but do not qualify for hedge accounting)3.18.1 Interest income and expense3.18.4 Dividend incomeInterest income and expense on debt securities at fair value through profit or loss (excluding beneficiary certificates, equity investments and 
other debt instruments), loans, financial instruments at amortized cost and debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income, are 
recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1109 
Financial Instruments. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and 
allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial 
instrument or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial 
liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates expected cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the financial 
instrument but does not consider expected credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid (main components of effective interest 
rate only) or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other 
premiums or discounts. In those rare cases when it is not possible to estimate reliably the cash flows and the expected life of a financial instrument, 
the Group uses the contractual cash flows over the full contractual term of the financial instrument.Interest income on impaired financial assets is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the expected cash flows for the purpose of 
measuring the impairment loss.Interest income on debt securities at fair value through profit or loss is also classified as interest income in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.Dividend income is recognized in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established. Dividend income is recognized as net gains or 
losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss or other operating income depending on the classification of equity securities.3.19 Employee Compensation and Benefits3.19.1 Post-employment benefits:3.19.1.1 Defined contribution plansWhen an employee has rendered service to the Group during a period, the Group recognizes the contribution payable to a defined contribution 
plan in exchange for that service as post-employment benefits for the period..3.19.1.2 Defined benefit plansAll post-employment benefits, other than defined contribution plans, are classified as defined benefit plans. The amount recognized as a net 
defined benefit liability is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the end of the reporting period.The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit method. The 
rate used to discount post-employment benefit obligations is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on 
high quality corporate bonds. The currency and term of the corporate bonds are consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-
employment benefit obligations. Actuarial gains and losses resulted from changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments are 
recognized in other comprehensive income.When the total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation minus the fair value of plan assets results in an asset, it is recognized to the 
extent of the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods, resulting from the 
introduction or changes to a defined benefit plan. Such past service cost is immediately recognized as an expense for the period.3.19.2 Short-term employee benefitsShort-term employee benefits are employee benefits that are expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the annual 
reporting period in which the employees render the related service. When an employee has rendered service to the Group during an accounting 
period, the Group recognizes the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service as an 
expense for the period.The expected cost of profit-sharing and bonus payments is recognized as liabilities when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
to make payments as a result of past events, such as service rendered by employees, and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.3.19.3 Share-based paymentThe Group has provided its directors and employees with stock grants, mileage stocks and long-term sharebased payments programs. When 
stock grants are exercised, the Group can either select to distribute newly issued shares or treasury shares or compensate in cash based on the 
share price. When mileage stocks and long-term share-based payments are exercised, the Group pays the amount equivalent to share price of 
KB Financial Group Inc. in cash.For a share-based payment transaction in which the terms of the arrangement provide the Group with the choice of whether to settle in cash or 
by issuing equity instruments, the Group accounts for the transaction in accordance with the requirements applying to cash-settled share-based 
payment transactions because the Group determines that it has a present obligation to settle in cash because the Group has a past practice 
and a stated policy of settling in cash. Therefore, the Group measures the liability incurred as consideration for the service, at fair value and 
recognizes related expense and accrued expense over the vesting periods. For mileage stocks and long-term share-based payments program, 
the Group accounts for the transaction in accordance with the requirements applying to cash-settled share-based payment transactions, which 
are recognized as expense and accrued expenses at the time of vesting.Until the liability is settled, the Group remeasures the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, 
with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss as share-based payments.3.19.4 Termination benefitsTermination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or an employee’s decision to 
accept an offer of benefits in exchange for the termination of employment. The Group recognizes a liability and expense for termination benefits 
at the earlier of the following dates; when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group recognizes costs 
for a restructuring that is within the scope of Korean IFRS No.1037 and involves the payment of termination benefits. If the termination benefits 
are not expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the annual reporting period, then the termination benefits are 
discounted to present value.3.20 Income Tax ExpensesIncome tax expense comprises current tax expense and deferred income tax expense. Current and deferred income tax are recognized as income 
or expense and included in profit or loss for the period, except to the extent that the tax arises from (a) a transaction or event which is recognized, 
in the same or a different period, outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and (b) a business combination.3.20.1 Current income taxCurrent income tax is the amount of income tax payable in respect of the taxable profit (loss) for the period. A difference between the taxable 
profit and accounting profit may arise when income or expense is included in accounting profit in one period but is included in taxable profit in 
a different period. Differences may also arise if there is revenue that is exempt from taxation, or expense that is not deductible in determining 
taxable profit (loss). Current income tax liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured using the tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.The Group offsets current income tax assets and current income tax liabilities if, and only if, the Group (a) has a legally enforceable right to set off 
the recognized amounts and (b) intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.3.20.2 Deferred income taxDeferred income tax is recognized, using the asset-liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax-based amount of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amount in the financial statements. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. However, deferred income tax liabilities are 
not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if they arise 
from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, and at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.The Group recognizes a deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates, and 
joint ventures, except to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference, and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.The carrying amount of a deferred income tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The Group reduces the carrying amount of 
a deferred income tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part 
or all of that deferred income tax asset to be utilized.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or 
the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. 
The measurement of deferred income tax liabilities and deferred income tax assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the 
manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.The Group offsets deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities if, and only if the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off 
current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities relate 
to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle 
current income tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in 
which significant amounts of deferred income tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.3.20.3 Uncertain tax positionsUncertain tax positions arise from tax treatments applied by the Group which may be challenged by the tax authorities due to the complexity of 
the transaction or different interpretation of the tax laws, a claim for rectification brought by the Group, an appeal for a refund claimed from the 
tax authorities related to additional assessments or a tax investigation by the tax authorities. The Group recognizes its uncertain tax positions 
in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1012 and Interpretation of Korean IFRS No.2123. The income tax 
asset is recognized if a tax refund is probable for taxes paid and levied by the tax authority, and the amount to be paid as a result of the tax 
investigation and others is recognized as the current tax payable. However, additional dues on tax paid or refund are recognized in accordance 
with Korean IFRS No.1037 because those are, in substance, interest and penalty.3.21 Earnings per ShareThe Group calculates basic earnings per share amounts and diluted earnings per share amounts for profit or loss attributable to ordinary 
equity holders of the Parent Company and presents them in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Basic earnings per share is 
calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the Group adjusts profit or loss attributable to 
ordinary equity holders of the Parent Company, and the weighted average number of shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares including convertible bonds and share options.3.22 LeaseThe Group as a lessor recognizes lease payments from operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs 
incurred in obtaining an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the underlying asset and recognized as expense over the lease 
term on the same basis as lease income. The respective leased assets are included in the consolidated statement of financial position based on 
their nature.A lessee is required to recognize a right-of-use asset (lease assets) representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability 
representing its obligation to make lease payments. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured at the present value.Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:- Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable
- Variable lease payment that are depend on an index or a rate
- Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees
- The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and
- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the leaseThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be 
readily determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, which is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow 
over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar 
economic environment.Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:- The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability
- Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received
- Any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee, and
- An estimate of restoration costs4. Financial Risk Management4.1 Summary4.1.1 Overview of financial risk management policyThe financial risks that the Group is exposed to are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and others.This note regarding financial risk management provides information about the risks that the Group is exposed to and about its objectives, 
policies, risk assessment and management procedures, and capital management. Additional quantitative information is disclosed throughout the 
consolidated financial statements.The Group’s risk management system focuses on efficiently supporting long-term strategy and management decisions through increased risk 
transparency, spread of risk management culture and preemptive response to rapidly changing financial environments. Credit risk, market risk, 
liquidity risk, and operational risk are recognized as the Group’s significant risks and measured and managed by quantifying them in the form of 
Internal Capital or Value at Risk (“VaR”) using statistical methods.4.1.2 Risk management organization4.1.2.1 Risk Management CommitteeHowever, the Group can elect not to apply the requirements of Korean IFRS No.1116 to short-term lease (lease that, at the commencement 
date, has a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value (for example, underlying leased asset 
under $ 5,000).The right-of-use asset is depreciated from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the 
end of the lease term.The Risk Management Committee, as the ultimate decision-making body, deals with risk-related issues, such as establishing risk management 
strategies in accordance with the strategic direction determined by the Board of Directors, determining the affordable level of risk appetite, 
reviewing the level of risk and the status of risk management activities, approving the application of risk management systems, methodologies, 
and major improvements, and establishing and approving risk management policies and procedures to timely recognize, measure, monitor, and 
control risks arising from various transactions by the Group.For sale and leaseback transactions, the Group applies the requirements of Korean IFRS No.1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to 
determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale of that asset.4.1.2.2 Risk Management Council3.23 Operating SegmentsThe Group identifies its operating segments based on internal reports which are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to 
make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.Segment information includes items which are directly attributable and reasonably allocated to the segment.The Risk Management Council is responsible for consulting on matters delegated by the Risk Management Committee and requests for review 
by the Management Executive Committee, consulting on details of each subsidiary’s risk management policies and procedures, monitoring the 
Group’s risk management status, and establishing and implementing necessary measures.4.1.2.3 Risk Management DepartmentThe Risk Management Department manages risk management policies, procedures, and business processes.3.24 Overlay ApproachThe Group applies the overlay approach in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1104 and a financial asset is eligible for designation for the overlay 
approach if, and only if, the following criteria are met:4.2 Credit Risk4.2.1 Overview of credit risk-  It is measured at fair value through profit or loss applying Korean IFRS No.1109 but would not have been measured at fair value through profitor loss in its entirety applying Korean IFRS No.1039 and- It is not held in respect of an activity that is unconnected with contracts within the scope of Korean IFRS No.1104.Credit risk is the risk of loss from the portfolio of assets held due to the counterparty’s default, breach of contract and deterioration of credit 
quality. For risk management reporting purposes, the Group considers all factors of credit risk exposure, such as default risk of individual 
borrowers, country risk and risk of specific sectors.The Group reclassifies between profit or loss and other comprehensive income, and the amount reclassified is equal to the difference between:- The amount reported in profit or loss for the designated financial assets applying Korean IFRS No.1109 and
- The amount that would have been reported in profit or loss for the designated financial assets if the insurer had applied Korean IFRS No.1039.The Group defines default as the definition applied to the calculation of Capital Adequacy Ratio under the new Basel Accord (Basel III).4.2.2 Credit risk managementThe Group is permitted to apply the overlay approach either at initial recognition or it may subsequently designate financial assets that newly 
meet criterion of not being held in respect of an activity that is unconnected with insurance contract, having previously not met that criterion.The Group measures the expected loss and economic capital for the assets subject to credit risk management, including on-balance and off-
balance assets, and uses them as management indicators. The Group allocates and manages credit risk economic capital limits.The Group continues to apply the overlay approach to a designated financial asset until that financial asset is derecognized. However, the Group 
de-designates a financial asset when the financial asset no longer meets the criterion. In this case, the Group reclassifies from accumulated 
other comprehensive income to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment any balance relating to that financial asset.At the beginning of any annual period, the Group may stop applying the overlay approach to all designated financial assets, and cannot 
subsequently apply the overlay approach, if it stops using this approach because it is no longer an insurer.In addition, to prevent excessive concentration of exposures by borrower and industry, the total exposure limit at the Group level is introduced, 
applied, and managed to control the credit concentration risk.In order to establish a credit risk management system, the Group manages credit risk by forming a separate risk management organization. In 
particular, independent of the Sales Group, the Credit Analysis Group of Kookmin Bank, a subsidiary, is in charge of loan policy, loan system, 
credit rating, credit analysis, follow-up management and corporate restructuring. The Risk Management Group of Kookmin Bank is responsible 
for establishing policies on credit risk management, measuring and limiting economic capital of credit risk, setting credit limits, credit review, and 
verification of credit rating models.4.2.3 Maximum exposure to credit riskThe Group’s maximum exposures of financial instruments other than equity securities, to credit risk without consideration of collateral values as of 
December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:4.2.4.1 Credit risk exposureCredit qualities of loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:(In millions of Korean won)Financial assets

through other comprehensive income. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are excluded. Expected credit losses are a probability-
weighted estimate of possible credit losses occurred in a certain range by reflecting reasonable and supportable information that is reasonably 
available at the reporting date without undue cost or effort, including information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of 
future economic conditions. The Group measures the expected credit losses of loans classified as financial assets measured at amortized 
cost, by deducting allowances for credit losses. The expected credit losses of loans classified as financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income are presented in other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements.Loans measured at fair value through

related to finance and insurance industry with high credit ratings.4.3 Liquidity Risk4.3.1 Overview of liquidity riskLiquidity risk is a risk that the Group becomes insolvent due to the mismatch between the inflow and outflow of funds, unexpected cash outflows, 
or a risk of loss due to financing funds at a high interest rate or disposing of securities at an unfavorable price due to lack of available funds. The 
Group manages its liquidity risk through analysis of the contractual maturity of interest-bearing assets and liabilities, assets and liabilities related 
to the other inflows and outflows of funds, and off-balance sheet items related to the inflows and outflows of funds such as currency derivative 
instruments and others.The Group calculates and manages cumulative liquidity gaps and liquidity ratio for all transactions and offbalance transactions, that affect the 
cashflows in Korean won and foreign currency funds raised and operated for the management of liquidity risks and periodically reports them to the 
Risk Management Council and the Risk Management Committee.4.3.3 Analysis of remaining contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilitiesThe cash flows disclosed in the maturity analysis are undiscounted contractual amounts including principal and future interest receivables and 
payments; as such, the table below do not match with the amounts in the consolidated statements of financial position which are based on 
discounted cash flows. The future interest receipts and payments for floating-rate assets and liabilities are calculated on the assumption that the 
current interest rate is the same until maturity.4.3.3.1  Remaining contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities other than derivatives held for cash flow hedge as of December 31, 2020and 2019, are as follows:Financial assets

2  Financial liabilities measured or designated at fair value through profit or loss and derivatives held for trading are not managed by contractual maturity 
because they are expected to be traded or redeemed before maturity. Therefore, the carrying amounts of those financial instruments are included in the 
‘On demand’ category.
3 Cash flows of derivative instruments held for hedging are shown at net amounts of cash inflows and outflows by remaining contractual maturity.
4  Equity securities designated as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are included in the ‘On demand’ category because most 
are available for sale at any time. However, equity securities restricted from sale, are included in the category corresponding to the date on which the 
restriction is lifted.
5 Deposits that are contractually repayable on demand or on short notice are included in the ‘On demand’ category.
6 Commitments are included in the ‘On demand’ category because payments can be requested at any time.

which arise from securities and derivatives and others. The most significant risks associated with trading position are interest rate risk and currency 
risk, and additional risks include stock price risk. The non-trading position is also exposed to interest rate risk. The Group manages the market risks 
by dividing them into those arising from the trading position and those arising from the nontrading position. The above market risks are measured 
and managed by subsidiaries.4.4.2 Risk managementThe Group sets and monitors internal capital limits for market and interest rate risk to manage the risks of trading and non-trading positions. In 
order to manage market risk efficiently, the Group maintains risk management systems and procedures such as trading policies and procedures, 
market risk management guidelines for trading positions, and interest rate risk management guidelines for non-trading positions. The entire process 
is carried out through consultation with the Risk Management Council and approval of the Risk Management Committee of the Group.In case of Kookmin Bank, a major subsidiary, the Risk Management Council establishes and enforces overall market risk management policies for 
market risk management and decides to establish position limits, loss limits, VaR limits, and approves non-standard new products. In addition, the 
Market Risk Management Committee, chaired by Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”), is a practical decision-making body for market risk management and 
determines position limits, loss limits, VaR limits, sensitivity limits, and scenario loss limits for each department of business group.Kookmin Bank’s Asset-Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) determines interest rate and commission operating standards and Asset Liability 
Management (“ALM”) operation policies and enacts and revises relevant guidelines. The Risk Management Committee and the Risk Management 
Council monitor the establishment and enforcement of ALM risk management policies and enact and revise ALM risk management guidelines. 
Interest rate risk limits are set based on future asset and liability positions and expected interest rate volatility, which reflect annual business plans. 
The ALM Department and the Risk Management Department regularly measure and monitor interest rate risks and report the status and limit of 
interest rate risk including changes in Economic Value of Equity (“△EVE”), changes in Net Interest Income (“△NII”), and duration gap to the ALCO 
and the Risk Management Council on a monthly basis, and to the Risk Management Committee on a quarterly basis. To ensure the adequacy of 
interest rate and liquidity risk management, the Risk Management Department assigns the limits, monitors and reviews the procedures and tasks of 
ALM operations conducted by the ALM department, and reports to the management independently.The Group is closely monitoring the outputs of various industry groups and markets that manage the transition to new interest rate, including 
announcements by Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) regulation authority. Regulation authority has made it clear that as of December 31, 2021, 
they will no longer persuade or force banks to submit IBORs. In response to these announcements, the Group established an IBOR transition 
program and plan consisting of major business areas such as finance, accounting, tax, legal, IT, and risk. The program is under the control of 
the CFO and reports matters to the board of directors and to a council with senior management members. The purpose of the program is to 
understand where exposure to IBOR occurs within the business and prepare and implement an action plan to facilitate the transition to alternativeinterest rate. The Group aims to complete the transition and alternative plan by the year-end of 2021. In addition, for CD interest rates, interest 
rates are being reformed by the relevant institutions that calculate, announce and manage the interest rates, and related institutions such as the 
Bank of Korea and the financial authorities. The Group continues its efforts as a market participant to actively express opinions so that the index 
interest rate reform can be carried out in the direction of minimizing the financial and non-financial impacts and operational risks on the Group 
and minimizing confusion among stakeholders.4.4.3 Trading position4.4.3.1 Definition of a trading positionThe trading position, which is subject to market risk management, is the trading position defined in “Trading Policy and Guidelines” and the basic 
requirements for the trading position are as follows:–  The target position has no restrictions on the sale, and the daily fair value assessment should be made and the embedded significant risk can behedged in the market.–  The trading position classification criteria should be clearly defined in the Trading Policy and Guidelines, and the trading position should bemanaged by a separate trading department.– The target position must be operated according to the documented trading strategy and the position’s limit management must be carried out.
–  The specialized dealer or operating department shall have the authority to execute the transaction without prior approval from the RiskManagement Department, etc. within the pre-determined limits of the target position.– Target positions should be periodically reported to management for risk management of the Group.4.4.3.2 Observation method of market risk arising from trading positionsSubsidiaries of the Group measures market risk by calculating VaR through the market risk management system for all trading positions. Generally, 
the Group manages market risks arising from trading positions at the portfolio level. In addition, the Group controls and manages the risk of derivative 
financial instrument transactions in accordance with the Financial Supervisory Service regulations and guidelines.4.4.3.3 VaR(a) VaRKookmin Bank, a major subsidiary, uses the risk-based valuation method (VaR) to measure the market risk of the trading position. Kookmin Bank 
uses the 10-day VaR, which represents the maximum amount of possible loss of 10 business days based on the historical simulation model of the 
full valuation method. The distribution of value changes in the portfolio is estimated based on data from the past 250 business days, and 10-day 
VaR is calculated by the difference between the value of the portfolio at a 99% confident level of distribution of value changes in the portfolio and 
the current market value.VaR is a commonly used market risk measurement technique. However, this approach has some limitations. VaR estimates possible losses under 
certain confidence level based on historical market change data. However, since past market changes cannot reflect all future conditions and 
circumstances, the timing and magnitude of actual losses may vary depending on assumptions in the calculation process. If one day or ten 
days of the holding period which is generally used for normal period of liquidating the position, is not sufficient or too long, the VaR result may 
underestimate or overestimate the potential loss.When a subsidiary with a trading position measures market risk for trading position, it uses an internal model (VaR) for general risk and a standard 
method for individual risks. Standard method is used if internal model is not authorized for certain market risk. Therefore, disclosed market risk VaR 
does not reflect the market risk for individual risks and for some positions. In addition, non-bank subsidiaries use the same standard method as the 
regulatory capital calculation method in order to enhance the effectiveness of market risk VaR management (improving the link with regulatory 
capital).(b) Back-TestingTo verify the appropriateness of the VaR model, back-testing is performed by comparing actual and hypothetical gains and losses with the VaR 
calculation results.(c) Stress TestingThe Group carries out a stress testing of the trading and available-for-sale portfolio to reflect changes in individual risk factors such as interest 
rates, stock prices, exchange rates, and implied volatility of derivatives that have a significant impact on portfolio value in a crisis. The Group carries 
out a stress testing through historical and hypothetical scenarios. This stress testing is carried out more than once a year.Ten-day VaR at a 99% confidence level of interest rate, stock price and foreign exchange rate risk for trading positions by Kookmin Bank for the 
years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:Kookmin BankInterest rate risk

etc., and is measured by △EVE or interest rate VaR and △NII. In addition, the average interest rate revision maturity and the longest interest rate 
revision maturity of demand deposits are managed through a quantitative methodology.4.4.4.3 Interest rate risk levels(a) Subsidiary Kookmin BankKookmin Bank calculates △EVE by applying six interest rate shocks and stress scenarios, and △NII by applying parallel shock up and down scenarios.

6,510The interest rate risk for trading positions usually arises from debt securities denominated in Korean won. The Group’s trading strategy is to gain 
short-term trading gains from interest rate fluctuations. The Group manages interest rate risks associated with trading accounts using VaR and 
sensitivity analysis (Price Value of a Basis Point: PVBP).(b) Stock price riskStock price risk occurs only in trading stocks denominated in Korean won because there are no trading stocks denominated in foreign currency. The 
portfolio of trading stocks denominated in Korean won consists of stocks listed on the exchange and derivatives linked to stocks and is managed 
by strict distributed investment limits.(c) Foreign exchange rate riskForeign exchange rate risk arises from holding assets, liabilities and currency-related derivatives which are denominated in foreign currency. Most 
of the net foreign currency exposures occur in the US dollars and the Chinese Yuan. The Group also manages net foreign exchange exposures 
across trading and non-trading portfolios by setting a net foreign currency exposure limit at the same time setting a loss limit.4.4.4 Non-trading position4.4.4.1 Definition of non-trading positionInterest rate risk management targets for non-trading positions include both on-balance and off-balance assets, liabilities and derivatives that are 
sensitive to interest rate, except for trading positions that are subject to market risk measurement. Interest-sensitive assets and liabilities refer to 
interest-bearing assets and liabilities that generate interest income and interest expenses.4.4.5 Financial instruments denominated in foreign currenciesDetails of financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and translated into Korean won as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as

management culture, strengthen internal control, improve processes and provide timely feedback to management and all employees. Kookmin 
Bank, a subsidiary, established a Business Continuity Planning (BCP) to carry out continuous work in emergency situations and established 
alternative facilities. The Group conducts simulation training for headquarters and IT departments to check the business continuity framework.4.6 Capital AdequacyThe Group complies with the capital adequacy standard established by the Financial Services Commission. This capital adequacy standard is based 
on Basel III revised by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Bank for International Settlements in June 2011 and was implemented in Korea in 
December 2013.The Group is required to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 8.0%, a minimum Tier 1 ratio of :9.5% and a minimum Total 
Regulatory Capital of 11.5% as of December 31, 2020.The Group’s equity capital is classified into three categories in accordance with the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory Regulations 
on Financial Holding Companies:-  Common Equity Tier 1 Capital: Common equity Tier 1 Capital is the first to take losses in the Group and is the last to be compensated in 
liquidation of the Group and not repaid except for liquidation. It includes capital, capital surplus, retained earnings, non-controlling interests of 
the consolidated subsidiaries, accumulated other comprehensive income and other capital surplus etc.-  Additional Tier 1 Capital: Additional Tier 1 Capital includes capital, capital surplus, etc. related to the issuance of capital securities of a permanentnature that meets the conditional capital securities requirements.-  Tier 2 Capital: Tier 2 Capital means capital that can compensate for losses of the Group upon liquidation, including (a) the amount of 
subordinated bonds with maturity of not less than 5 years that meet the conditional capital securities requirements, and (b) the allowance for 
credit losses accumulated on the loans which are classified as normal or precautionary in accordance with Regulation on Supervision of Financial 
Holding Companies and others.The risk-weighted assets are the magnitude of the amount of risk inherent in the total asset held by the Group. The Group calculates risk-weighted 
assets by each risk (credit risk, market risk, and operational risk) based on the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory Regulations on 
Financial Holding Companies and uses them to calculate BIS ratio.The Group evaluates and manages capital adequacy through separate internal policies. The valuation of capital adequacy compares the size ofavailable capital (the amount of capital actually available) to the size of internal capital (the amount of capital required to cover all the significant risks 
faced by the Group under its target credit rating), which monitors financial soundness and provides a risk-adjusted performance measurement basis.Internal capital refers to the capital required to prevent the insolvency from future unexpected losses. The Group operates a system to measure, 
allocate and manage internal capital to major subsidiaries by risk type.The Risk Management Committee of the Group determines the risk appetite of the Group, allocates internal capital by risk type and major 
subsidiaries, and major subsidiaries operate capital efficiently within the range of the allocated internal capital. The Risk Management Department 
of the Group monitors internal capital limit management and reports it to the management and the Risk Management Committee. If the limit of 
internal capital is expected to be exceeded due to new businesses or business expansion, the Group’s capital adequacy management is carried out 
through review and approval by the Risk Management Committee in advance.Details of the Group’s capital adequacy calculation in accordance with Basel III requirements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:Equity Capital:
    Tier 1 Capital

436,421,064₩₩₩₩₩₩₩Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants. The Group discloses the fair value of each class of assets and liabilities in a way that permits it to be compared with its carrying 
amount at the end of each reporting period. The best evidence of fair value of financial instruments is a quoted price in an active market.Methods of determining fair value of financial instruments are as follows:Cash and due
from financial
institutionsCarrying amounts of cash and demand due from financial institutions and payment due from financial institutions are reasonable 
approximation of fair values. These financial instruments do not have a fixed maturity and are receivable on demand. Fair value 
of ordinary due from financial institutions is measured using Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) Model.SecuritiesFair value of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets is determined using the quoted prices. If there is no quoted 
price, fair value is determined using external professional valuation institution. The institutions use one or more of the following 
valuation techniques including DCF Model, Free Cash Flow to Equity Model, Comparable Company Analysis, Dividend Discount 
Model, Risk Adjusted Discount Rate Method, and Net Asset Value Method, deemed suitable considering the characteristics of 
the financial instruments.Loans measured at
amortized costDCF model is used to determine the fair value of loans. Fair value is determined by discounting the expected cash flows, which 
are contractual cash flows adjusted by the expected prepayment rate, at an appropriate discount rate.Derivatives and 
financia instruments 
at fair value through 
profit or lossFor exchange traded derivatives, quoted price in an active market is used to determine fair value and for OTC derivatives, fair 
value is determined using valuation techniques. The Group uses internally developed valuation models that are widely used by 
market participants to determine fair values of plain vanilla OTC derivatives including options, interest rate swaps, and currency 
swaps, based on observable market parameters. However, some complex financial instruments are valued using appropriate 
models  developed  from  generally  accepted  market  valuation  models  including  the  Finite  Difference  Method  (“FDM”),  the 
MonteCarlo Simulation, Black-Scholes Model, Hull and White Model, Closed Form and Tree Model or valuation results from 
independent external professional valuation institution.DepositsBorrowingsDebenturesCarrying amount of demand deposits is regarded as representative of fair value because they do not have a fixed maturity and are 
payable on demand. Fair value of time deposits is determined using a DCF model. Fair value is determined by discounting the 
expected cash flows, which are contractual cash flows adjusted by the expected prepayment rate, at an appropriate discount rate.Carrying amount of overdraft in foreign currency is regarded as representative of fair value because they do not have a fixed 
maturity and are payable on demand. Fair value of other borrowings is determined using a DCF model discounting contractual 
future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate.Fair value is determined by using the valuation results of external professional valuation institution, which are calculated using 
market inputs.Other financial
assets and liabilitiesCarrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair values. These financial instruments are temporary accounts used for 
other various transactions and their maturities are relatively short or not defined.6.1.2 Fair value hierarchyThe Group believes that valuation methods used for measuring the fair values of financial instruments are reasonable and that the fair values 
recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position are appropriate. However, the fair values of the financial instruments recognized in 
the consolidated statement of financial position may be different if other valuation methods or assumptions are used. Additionally, as there is a 
variety of valuation techniques and assumptions used in measuring fair value, it may be difficult to reasonably compare the fair value with that of 
other financial institutions.The Group classifies and discloses fair value of the financial instruments into the three-level hierarchy as follows:Level 1:  The fair values are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at themeasurement date.Level 2:  The fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, eitherdirectly or indirectly.Level 3: The fair values are based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.The fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to 
the entire measurement. If an observable input requires an adjustment using an unobservable input and that adjustment results in a significantly 
higher or lower fair value measurement, the resulting measurement would be categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.6.1.2.1 Fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial positionFair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2020 and

are affected by unobservable parameters, using a statistical technique. When the fair value is affected by more than one input parameter, the 
amounts represent the most favorable or most unfavorable outcome. Level 3 financial instruments subject to sensitivity analysis are (a) equity-
related derivatives, currency-related derivatives and interest rate related derivatives whose fair value changes are recognized in profit or loss, 
(b) financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, and (c) due from financial institutions, debt securities (including beneficiary 
certificates), equity securities and loan receivables whose fair value changes are recognized in profit or loss or other comprehensive income. If 
overlay approach is applied in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1104, changes in fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are 
recognized as other comprehensive income.Results of the sensitivity analysis of changes in inputs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:(In millions of Korean won)Profit or lossOther comprehensive income (loss)Favorable changesUnfavorable changesFavorable changesUnfavorable changesDecember 31, 2020Financial assets

-1  For financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters such as 
volatility of the underlying asset or correlation coefficient between underlying asset by ± 10%.
2  For derivatives financial instruments, changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters; such as, price of underlying asset, 
volatility of stock price, volatility of interest rate by ± 10% and the loss given default ratio, discount rate by ± 1%.
3  For equity securities, changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters; such as, correlation between growth rate (0~1%) 
and discount rate (-1~1%) or between liquidation value (- 1~1%) and discount rate (-1~1%).
4  For beneficiary certificates, it is practically impossible to analyze sensitivity of changes in unobservable inputs. But only for beneficiary certificates whose 
underlying assets are real estates, changes in fair value are calculated by shift
5  For loans, changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters such as stock price, volatility of stock price (-10~10%), 
discount rate (-1~1%).
6  For loans measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters 
such as discount rate, volatility of the underlying asset 1%, growth rate 10%.6.2.4 Day one gains or lossesIf the Group uses a valuation technique that incorporates data not obtained from observable markets for the fair value at initial recognition of 
financial instruments, there could be a difference between the transaction price and the amount determined using that valuation technique. In 
these circumstances, the fair value of financial instruments is recognized as the transaction price, and the difference is not recognized in profit 
or loss but deferred and amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the financial instrument. When the fair value of the financial 
instruments is subsequently determined using observable market inputs, the remaining deferred amount is recognized in profit or loss.Changes in aggregate deferred differences for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:Balance at the beginning of the year

balance of the eligible asset-backed securitization (ABS), a trust-type ABS, is below the solvency margin ratio (minimum rate: 104.5%) of the beneficiary interest in 
the trust. To avoid such early redemption, the Group entrusts credit card accounts and deposits in addition to the previously entrusted credit card accounts.6.4.3 Bonds sold under repurchase agreements and loaned securitiesThe Group continues to recognize the financial assets related to bonds sold under repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions in the 
consolidated statement of financial position since those transactions are not qualified for derecognition even though the Group transfers the financial assets. 
Bonds sold under repurchase agreements are sold on the condition that they will be repurchased at a fixed price and loaned securities will be returned at 
the expiration of the loan period. Thus, the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets. The carrying amount of

(8,900)The Group’s exposure to hedging relationships related to the interest rate benchmark reform as of December 31, 2020, is as follows. The USD LIBOR 
interest rate will be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) based on actual transactions starting in 2022 and the KRW CD rate is 
currently under consideration for improving the calculation methodology. In this hedging relationship, the Group assumed that the spread to be changed 
on a SOFR basis in 2022 would be similar to that included in the interest rate swap used as a hedging instrument, and no other changes were assumed.Interest rate benchmarkCurrencyCarrying amount of

3.00For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business 
combination, and cash-generating units consist of an operating segment or units which are not larger than an operating segment.The Group recognized goodwill amounting to ₩ 65,288 million from the merger of Housing & Commercial Bank, the amounts of ₩ 49,315 
million and ₩ 15,973 million were allocated to the retail banking and corporate banking, respectively.And the goodwill of ₩ 356,570 million arising from the acquisition of PRASAC Microfinance Institution Plc. was allocated to microfinance unit.Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the unit 
may be impaired, by comparing the carrying amount of the unit, including the goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the unit.The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is measured at the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The fair value 
less costs to sell is the amount obtainable from the sale in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs 
of disposal. If it is difficult to measure the amount obtainable from the sale of the cash-generating unit, the Group measures the fair value less 
costs to sell by reflecting the characteristics of the measured cash-generating unit. If it is not possible to obtain reliable information to measure 
the fair value less costs to sell, the Group uses the asset’s value in use as its recoverable amount. Value in use is the present value of the future 
cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit. The projections of the future cash flows are based on the most recent 
financial budget approved by management and generally cover a period of five years. The future cash flows of retail banking and corporate 
banking after projection period are estimated on the assumption that the future cash flows will increase by 1.0% per year. The key assumptions 
used for the estimation of the future cash flows are estimated based on the market size and the Group’s market share.The future cash flows PRASAC Microfinance Institution Plc. after five years are estimated on the assumption that the future cash flows will 
increase by 3.0% per year. The key assumptions used for the estimation of the future cash flows are the GDP growth rate of Cambodia, the 
market size and the recent growth rate of PRASAC Microfinance Institution Plc. The discount rate is a pre-tax rate that reflects assumptions 
regarding risk-free interest rate, market risk premium and the risks specific to the cash-generating unit.The Group acquired a 67% stake in PT Bank Bukopin TBK with the acquisition date of September 2, 2020, and the goodwill recognized due to 
the business combination is ₩ 80,002 million as of December 31, 2020. The Group conducts an impairment test annually and whenever there is 
an indication of impairment, and no indication of impairment has been observed as of December 31, 2020.15.6 Changes in intangible assets other than goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:BeginningAcquisition

- The Group assumes actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more than expected) and investment risk.The net defined benefit liability recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position is calculated by independent actuaries in accordance 
with actuarial valuation methods. The net defined benefit obligation is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit method (the ‘PUC’). Data used 
in the PUC such as interest rates, future salary increase rate, mortality rate and consumer price index are based on observable market data and 
historical data which are updated annually.Actuarial assumptions may differ from actual results, due to changes in the market, economic trends and mortality trends which may impact 
defined benefit liabilities and future payments. Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in the period 
incurred through other comprehensive income.25.2 Changes in net defined benefit liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:(In millions of Korean won)2020Present value of definedbenefit obligationFair value of plan assetsNet defined benefit liabilitiesBeginning

number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group 
has categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares such as stock grants and ordinary share exchange rights of exchangeable bonds.A calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average market share price 
for the year) based on the monetary value of stock grants. The number of shares calculated above is compared with the number of shares that 
would have been issued assuming the settlement of stock grants.In addition, exchangeable bonds issued for the year ended December 31, 2020, were included in potential ordinary shares from the exercisable 
date of the exchange right, and interest expenses after tax for the period were added to profit for diluted earnings per share.37.2.1 Adjusted profit for diluted earnings per shareAdjusted profit for diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:Profit attributable to shareholders of the Parent Company

5,09738.5 Risk Management of KB Insurance Co., Ltd.38.5.1 OverviewInsurance risk is the risk that arises from a primary operation of insurance companies that is associated with acceptance of insurance contract and 
payment of claims and is classified as the insurance price risk and the reserves risk. The insurance price risk is the risk of loss that might occur when 
the actual risk exceeds the expected risk rate or expected insurance administration expenses ratios in calculation of premiums. It is the risk of loss 
that arises from differences between actual payment of claims and premiums received from policyholders. The reserves risk is the risk that arises 
due to a deficit in reserves at the date of assessment, making the Group unable to cover the actual claims payment in the future.38.5.2 Purposes, policies and procedures to manage risk arising from insurance contractsThe risks associated with insurance contract that the Group faces are the insurance actuarial risk and the acceptance risk. Each risk occurs due to 
insurance contract’s pricing and conditions of acceptance. In order to minimize acceptance risk, the Group establishes guidelines and procedure 
for acceptance and outlines specific conditions for acceptance by product. In addition, expected risk level at the date of pricing is compared with 
actual risk of contracts after acceptance and various subsequent measures such as the adjustments in the interest rate and sales conditions, 
termination of selling specific product and others are taken in order to reduce insurance actuarial risk. The Group has a committee to discuss 
status of product acceptance risk and interest rate policy. The committee decides important matters to set the processes that allow minimizing the 
insurance actuarial risk, the acceptance risk and other business-related risk.In addition, according to reinsurance operating standards, the Group establishes an operating strategy of reinsurance for large claims expense due 
to unexpected catastrophic events. The Group aims at policy holders’ safety and its stable profit achievement. For the long-term goal, the Group 
manages risk at a comprehensive level to keep its value at the maximum.38.5.3 Exposure to insurance price riskAccording to RBC standard, exposure to insurance price risk is defined as net written premiums for prior one year that is calculated by adding and 
subtracting direct insurance premium, assumed reinsurance premium and ceded reinsurance premium.The Group’s exposure to insurance price risk as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as follows:(In millions of Korean won)Difference (A-B)₩General

property damage, injury, driver, savings, illness, nursing and pension) and various other insurances. The Group’s risk is distributed through 
reinsurance, joint acceptance and diversified selling. In addition, insurances that cover severe level of risk, although there is rare possibility of 
the occurrence of disaster, such as storm and flood insurance are limited, and the Group controls the risk through joint acquisition.Automobile InsuranceAccident yearEstimate of gross ultimate claims (A)

addition, Risk Management Committee sets ALM strategy every year to manage interest rate risk.38.5.9.3 Sensitivity to changes in interest ratesGenerally, when interest rates rise, the value and duration of assets and liabilities fall when interest rates fall, value and duration of assets and 
liabilities increase. Where duration of assets is shorter than that of liabilities with the interest rates fall, the interest rate risk is increased since the 
incremental portion of liabilities exceeds that of assets.38.5.9.4 Negative spread risk controlIn order to manage the negative margins risk between interest expenses on liabilities and investment incomes on assets, the Group sets the 
disclosure rate every month considering the market interest rate and the investment yield.38.6 Risk Management of KB Life Insurance Co., Ltd.38.6.1 OverviewInsurance risk is the risk of loss arising from the actual risk at the time of claims exceeding the estimated risk at the time of underwriting. Insurance 
risk is classified by insurance price risk and policy reserve risk.Insurance price risk is the risk of loss arising from differences between received from policyholders and actual claims paid.Policy reserve risk is the risk of loss arising from differences between policy reserves the Group holds and actual claims to be paid. Therefore, loss is 
recognized if actual claims are more than policy reserves.KB Life Insurance Co., Ltd. measures only insurance price risk under RBC requirement because life insurance claim pay-out is mainly in a fixed 
amount with less volatility in policy reserve and shorter waiting period before payment.38.6.2 Concentration of insurance risk and reinsurance policyThe Group uses reinsurance to mitigate concentration of insurance risk seeking an enhanced capital management.The Group categorized reinsurance into group and individual contracts, and reinsurance is ceded through the following process:(a)  In the decision-making process of launching a new product, the Group decides on ceding reinsurance. Subsequently, a reinsurer is selectedthrough bidding, agreements with the relevant departments and final approval by the executive management.(b) The reinsurance department analyses the object of reinsurance, the maximum limit of reinsurance and the loss ratio with the relevant departments.38.6.3 Characteristic and exposure of insurance price risk38.6.4 Assumptions used in measuring insurance liabilitiesThe exposure of insurance price risk is measured by the risk premium for all insurance contracts held for one year prior to the calculation date. The 
premium for risk retention is calculated by adding direct insurance premium and reinsurance assumed premium, and deducting reinsurance ceded 
premium (which is paid to reinsurance companies). If the holding risk premium is less than zero, the exposure of the insurance price is measured as 
zero.The insurance risk of a life insurance company is measured by insurance price risk. As the life insurance coverage is in the form of a fixed payment, 
the fluctuation of policy reserve is small and the period from insured event to claims payment is not long. The policy reserve risk is managed by 
assessments of adequacy of the policy reserve.The Group applies assumed rates defined in the premium and liability reserve calculation manual provided by the regulatory authority and in accordance 
with the Insurance Business Act and the Regulations on Supervision of Insurance Business when measuring insurance liabilities at every reporting period. 
For variable interest type insurance, disclosed interest rate stated in the premium and liabilities reserve calculation manual, which is calculated based on 
adjusted external base rate and investment yield according to Article 6-12 of the Regulations on Supervision of Insurance Business.Reserve amount should exceed the standard reserve which is calculated using the standard interest rate and standard risk rate as required by the 
Enforcement Rules of the Insurance Business Act and the Regulations on Supervision of Insurance Business.The insurance price risk is managed through insurance risk management regulation established by Risk Management Committee.38.6.5 Maturity structure of premium reserve as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as follows:Maximum exposures to insurance price risk as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:Death

If the holding risk premium is less than zero, the exposure of the insurance price is measured as zero.The insurance risk of a life insurance company is measured by insurance price risk. As the life insurance coverage is in the form of a fixed payment, 
the fluctuation of policy reserve is small and the period from insured event to claims payment is not long. The policy reserve risk is managed by 
assessments of adequacy of the policy reserve.The insurance price risk is managed through insurance risk management regulation established by Risk Management Committee.Maximum exposures to insurance price risk as of December 31, 2020, are as follows:Death

Kookmin Card Co., Ltd. and KB Capital Co., Ltd. may transfer all or part of their shares in the joint-venture lease company to affiliates who agree 
to comply with all the terms and conditions of this agreement on the establishment and operation of the joint-venture lease company in Laos 
and agree to succeed their responsibility for the joint-venture lease company. After the expiration of the restriction period for the disposal, as 
prescribed separately, each party of the joint-venture lease company may transfer all or part of their shares. Meanwhile, KB KOLAO Leasing Co., 
LTD. is selling LVMC Holdings (formerly Kolao Holdings) allied receivables that are more than three months overdue to Lanexang Leasing Co., 
Ltd. in accordance with an agreement.f)   As of December 31, 2020, KB Capital Co., Ltd. and PT Sunindo Primasura are required to hold the shares of PT Sunindo Kookmin Best Finance 
for five years after the completion of the share purchase. If one party is going to sell all or part of the shares, provide them as collateral, trade or 
dispose of them, it should give the opportunity to exercise preemption to the other party by providing written proposal including transfer price, 
payment method and others. Meanwhile, the shareholders of PT Sunindo Kookmin Best Finance can receive dividends for up to 20% of net 
profit after taxes for each fiscal year starting from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.g)   KB Securities Co., Ltd., as a sales agency, sold ₩ 326,500 million of private equity funds and trusts, which loans to corporations (borrower) that 
invest in apartment rental businesses for the disabled in Australia, to individuals and institutional investors. However, management of the fund 
is impossible due to the breach of contract by local borrower in Australia, therefore there is a possibility of losses of principal to these funds 
subscribers. In this regard, there are three lawsuits in which the Group is the defendant as of December 31, 2020. There is a possibility that 
additional lawsuits will be filed in the future, but the magnitude and final outcome of the lawsuit are unpredictable.h)   In relation to Lime Asset Management, KB Securities Co., Ltd. has a PIS (Portfolio Index Swap) contract, as of December 31, 2020, associated 
with ‘Lime Thetis Qualified Investor Private Investment Trust No.2’ and Lime Pluto FI Qualified Investor Private Investment Trust No.D-1’ whose 
redemption were suspended during the fourth quarter of 2019. The notional amount of the underlying assets of the PIS contract is ₩ 298,500 
million. Meanwhile, the Group sold ₩ 68,100 million of feeder fund of aforementioned redemption-suspended funds. On October 20, 2020, 
Lime Asset Management’s license as a fund manager was revoked by the Financial Supervisory Service’s sanctions review committee, and 
most of its redemption-suspended funds and normal funds will be transferred to Wellbridge Asset Management (the bridge management 
company) to continue collecting investments. It is difficult to predict whether and when the aforementioned redemptionsuspended funds will be 
redeemed, and there is a possibility that lawsuits may be filed in the future, but the impact on the consolidated financial statements cannot be 
predicted at this time.i)   The proliferation of COVID-19 has had a negative impact on the global economy, which has a greater impact than expected credit losses andpotential impairment of assets in a particular portfolio, which can negatively affect the profit generation capability of the Group as follows:– There is a possibility of uncertainty about the credit risk of a borrower that could be affected by COVID-19.
  – Uncertainty may arise about forward-looking macroeconomic information related to expected credit losses.
  –  Korean won may depreciate against major foreign currencies. This may result in an increase in principal and interest payments on liabilitiesdenominated in foreign currencies, and losses on foreign exchanges transactions.– A significant decrease in the fair value of the Group’s investment in an entity that could be affected by COVID-19 pandemic can occur.Meanwhile, the Group’s accounting policy related to COVID-19 is described in Note 2.4 Critical accounting estimates and the impact on expected 
credit losses is described in Note 11.1 Changes in allowances for credit losses of loans and Note 24.2 Changes in provisions for credit losses of 
unused loan commitments, acceptances and guarantees.41.

Directors on February 4, 2021.Opinion
We have audited the separate financial statements of KB Financial Group Inc. (“the Company”), which comprise the separate statement of financial position 
as of December 31, 2020, the separate statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising 
a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.In our opinion, the accompanying separate financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the separate financial position of the Company as of 
December 31, 2020, and its separate financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Korean International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“K-IFRS”).We also have audited, in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing (KSAs), the Company’s Internal Control over Financial Reporting (“ICFR”) as of 
December 31, 2020 based on the criteria established in Conceptual Framework for Designing and Operating Internal Control over Financial Reporting issued 
by the Operating Committee of Internal Control over Financial Reporting in the Republic of Korea, and our report dated March 9, 2021 expressed an unmodified 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with KSAs. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for 
the Audit of the Separate Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the separate financial statements in Republic of Korea, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion.Emphasis of Matter
As a matter that does not affect our audit opinion, we draw attention to the following matter.As described in note 30.2.b) to the separate financial statements, the proliferation of COVID-19 has had a negative impact on the global economy, which 
may have a greater impact than expected credit losses and potential impairment of assets in a particular portfolio, and it could negatively affect the profit 
generation capability of the Company.Key Audit Matters
We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.Other Matters
The procedures and practices utilized in the Republic of Korea to audit such separate financial statements may differ from those generally accepted and applied 
in other countries.The separate financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2019 were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified 
opinion on those financial statements on March 5, 2020.Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Separate Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the separate financial statements in accordance with K-IFRS, and for such internal 
control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of separate financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.In preparing the separate financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends toliquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the separate financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with KSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these separate financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with KSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:∙  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the separate financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform 
audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.∙  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.∙  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used in the preparation of the separate financial statements and the reasonableness ofaccounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.∙  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.∙  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether theconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in the internal controls that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of 
the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Young-Min Kwon.KPMG Samjong Accounting Corp.

29₩KB Financial Group Inc. (the “Company”), in accordance with Financial Holding Companies Act, was established on September 29, 2008, through 
stock transfers with the former shareholders of Kookmin Bank, KB Investment & Securities Co., Ltd., KB Asset Management Co., Ltd., KB Real 
Estate Trust Co., Ltd., KB Investment Co., Ltd., KB Futures Co., Ltd., KB Credit Information Co., Ltd., and KB Data Systems Co., Ltd. in order to provide 
management services and financing to associated companies. The headquarters are located at 26, Gukjegeumyung-ro-8-gil, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul. 
The Company’s share capital as of December 31, 2020, is ₩ 2,090,558 million. In 2011, Kookmin Bank spun off its credit card business segment 
and established a new separate credit card company, KB Kookmin Card Co., Ltd., and KB Investment & Securities Co., Ltd. merged with KB Futures 
Co., Ltd. The Company established KB Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in January 2012, acquired Yehansoul Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in September 2013, and 
KB Savings Bank Co., Ltd. merged with Yehansoul Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in January 2014. In March 2014, the Company acquired Woori Financial Co., 
Ltd. and changed the name to KB Capital Co., Ltd. Meanwhile, the Company included LIG Insurance Co., Ltd. as an associate and changed the 
name to KB Insurance Co., Ltd. in June 2015, and KB Insurance Co., Ltd. became one of the subsidiaries through a tender offer in May 2017. Also, 
the Company included Hyundai Securities Co., Ltd. as an associate in June 2016 and included as a subsidiary in October 2016 by comprehensive 
exchange of shares. Hyundai Securities Co., Ltd. merged with KB Investment & Securities Co., Ltd. in December 2016 and changed its name to KB 
Securities Co., Ltd. in January 2017. In August 2020, the Company acquired Prudential Life Insurance Company of Korea Ltd., which was classified as 
a subsidiary.The Company has been listed on the Korea Exchange (“KRX”) since October 10, 2008, and on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) for its 
American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) since September 29, 2008. Number of shares authorized on its Articles of Incorporation is 1,000 million.2. Basis of Preparation2.1 Application of Korean IFRSThe Company maintains its accounting records in Korean won and prepares statutory financial statements in the Korean language (“Hangeul”) in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the Republic of Korea (“Korean IFRS”). The accompanying separate 
financial statements have been translated into English from the Korean language separate financial statements.The separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Korean IFRS. These are the standards, subsequent 
amendments and related interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) that have been adopted by the 
Republic of Korea.The preparation of separate financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. Management also needs to exercise 
judgment in applying the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions 
and estimates are significant to the separate financial statements are disclosed in Note 2.4.The separate financial statements were prepared in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1027 Separate Financial Statements.2.1.1 The Company has applied the following amended standards for the first time for its annual reporting period commencing January 1, 2020.-  Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1001 Presentation of Financial Statements and Korean IFRS No.1008 Accounting policies, changes in accountingestimates and errors – Definition of MaterialThe amendments clarify the definition of material. Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to 
influence the decisions that the primary users of general-purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements. These 
amendments do not have a significant impact on the financial statements.The above consolidated statements of financial position should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes.- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1103 Business Combination – Definition of a BusinessThe amended definition of a business requires an acquisition to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to 
the ability to create outputs and the definition of output excludes the returns in the form of lower costs and other economic benefits. If substantially 
all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, an entity may elect 
to apply an optional concentration test that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. 
These amendments do not have a significant impact on the financial statements.2.1.2 The Company has early adopted the following amended standards.-  Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1107 Financial Instruments: Disclosure, Korean IFRS No.1109 Financial Instruments – Interest Rate BenchmarkReformThese amendments provide exceptions applying hedge accounting even though interest rate benchmark reform gives rise to uncertainties. In 
the hedging relationship, an entity shall assume that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedge cash flows are based is not altered as a 
result of interest rate benchmark reform when determining whether a forecast transaction is highly probable and prospectively assessing hedging 
effectiveness. For a hedge of a non-contractually specified benchmark component of interest rate risk, an entity shall apply the requirement that 
the risk component shall be separately identifiable only at the inception of the hedging relationship. The application of this exception is ceased 
either when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and the amount of the 
interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedge item, or when the hedging relationship that the hedge item is part of is discontinued. The 
Company early adopted these amendments since 2019 as the amendments allow the early adoption.periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022, and earlier application is permitted. The Company does not expect that these amendments have a 
significant impact on the financial statements.- Annual improvements to Korean IFRS 2018-2020Annual improvements of Korean IFRS 2018-2020 Cycle should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022, and earlier 
application is permitted. The Company does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the financial statements.∙  Korean IFRS No.1101 First time Adoption of Korean International Financial Reporting Standards – Subsidiaries that are first-time adopters
∙  Korean IFRS No.1109 Financial Instruments – Fees related to the 10% test for derecognition of financial liabilities
∙  Korean IFRS No.1116 Leases – Lease incentives
∙ Korean IFRS No.1041 Agriculture – Measuring fair value- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1001 Presentation of Financial Statements - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-currentThe amendments clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, depending on the substantive rights that exist at the end of the 
reporting period. Classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise right to defer settlement of the liability or the management’s 
expectations thereof. Also, the settlement of liability includes the transfer of the entity’s own equity instruments; however, it would be excluded if an 
option to settle the liability by the transfer of the entity’s own equity instruments is recognized separately from the liability as an equity component of 
a compound financial instrument. The amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and earlier application 
is permitted. The Company does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the financial statements.2.1.3  The following amended standards have been published that are not mandatory for December 31, 2020 reporting periods and have not2.2 Measurement Basisbeen early adopted by the Company.- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1116 Leases – Practical expedient for COVID-19-Related Rent Exemption, Concessions, SuspensionAs a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a rent concession occurring as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic 
is a lease modification, and the amounts recognized in profit or loss as a result of applying this exemption should be disclosed. The amendments 
should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after June 1, 2020, and earlier application is permitted. The Group does not expect that these 
amendments have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.-  Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1109 Financial Instruments, Korean IFRS No.1039 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, Korean 
IFRS No.1107 Financial Instruments: Disclosure, Korean IFRS No.1104 Insurance Contracts and Korean IFRS No.1116 Lease – Interest Rate 
Benchmark ReformIn relation to interest rate benchmark reform, the amendments provide a practical expedient allowing entities to change the effective interest rate 
instead of changing the carrying amount and apply hedge accounting without discontinuance although the interest rate benchmark is replaced 
in hedging relationship. The amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021, and earlier application is 
permitted. The Company does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the financial statements.- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1016 Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before intended useThe amendments prohibit an entity from deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items 
produced while the entity is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, the entity will recognize the proceeds from selling such items, and the 
costs of producing those items, as profit or loss. The amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022, and 
earlier application is permitted. The Company does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the financial statements.- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1103 Business Combination – Reference to the Conceptual FrameworkThe amendments update a reference of definition of assets and liabilities to qualify for recognition in revised Conceptual Framework for Financial 
Reporting. However, the amendments add an exception for the recognition of liabilities and contingent liabilities within the scope of Korean IFRS 
No.1037 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, and Korean IFRS No.2121 Levies. The amendments also confirm that contingent 
assets should not be recognized at the acquisition date. The amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 
1, 2022, and earlier application is permitted. The Company does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the financial 
statements.- Amendments to Korean IFRS No.1037 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets - Onerous Contracts: Cost of Fulfilling a ContractThe amendments clarify that the direct costs of fulfilling a contract include both the incremental costs of fulfilling the contract and an allocation 
of other costs directly related to fulfilling contracts when assessing whether the contract is onerous. The amendments should be applied for annualThe separate financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified.2.3 Functional and Presentation CurrencyItems included in the separate financial statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the Company operates (“functional currency”). The separate financial statements are presented in Korean won, which is the Company’s 
functional and presentation currency.2.4 Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of the separate financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, certain critical accounting estimates and 
assumptions that may have a significant impact on the assets (liabilities) and incomes (expenses). Management’s estimates of outcomes may differ 
from actual outcomes if management’s estimates and assumptions based on management’s best judgment at the reporting date are different from 
the actual environment.Estimates and underlying assumptions are continually evaluated, and changes in accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the 
estimates are changed and in any future periods affected.Uncertainty in estimates and assumptions with significant risk that may result in material adjustment to the separate financial statements are as 
follows:2.4.1 Income taxesThe Company is operating in numerous countries and the income generated from these operations is subject to income taxes based on tax 
laws and interpretations of tax authorities in numerous jurisdictions. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax 
determination is uncertain.If certain portion of the taxable income is not used for investments, wages, etc. in accordance with the Korean regulation called ‘Special Taxation 
for Facilitation of Investment and Mutually-beneficial Cooperation’, the Company is liable to pay additional income tax calculated based on the tax 
laws. Therefore, the effect of recirculation of corporate income should be reflected in current and deferred income tax. As the Company’s income tax 
is dependent on the actual investments, wages, etc. per each year, there are uncertainties with regard to measuring the final tax effects during the 
period when the tax law is applied.2.4.2 Fair value of financial instrumentsThe fair value of financial instruments where no active market exists or where quoted prices are not otherwise available is determined by using 
valuation techniques. Financial instruments, which are not actively traded in the market and those with less transparent market prices, will have 
less objective fair values and require broad judgment on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty in market factors and assumptions in fair value 
determination and other risks.As described in the significant accounting policies in Note 3.1, ‘Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments’, diverse valuation 
techniques are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, from generally accepted market valuation models to internally developed 
valuation models that incorporate various types of assumptions and variables.2.4.3 Net defined benefit liabilityThe present value of net defined benefit liability depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of 
assumptions.3. Significant Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these separate financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.3.1 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments3.1.1 Initial recognitionThe Company recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when the Company becomes party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets (a purchase or sale of a financial asset under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the asset within the time frame established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned) is 
recognized and derecognized using trade date accounting.For financial reporting purpose, the Company classifies (a) financial assets as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets at fair 
value through other comprehensive income, or financial assets at amortized cost and (b) financial liabilities as financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss, or other financial liabilities. These classifications are based on business model for managing financial instruments and the contractual cash 
flow characteristics of the financial instrument at initial recognition.At initial recognition, a financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial 
liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or 
financial liability. The fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants. The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (that is, the fair value of 
the consideration given or received) in an arm’s length transaction.3.1.2 Subsequent measurementAfter initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at amortized cost or fair value based on classification at initial recognition.3.1.2.1 Amortized costThe amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial 
recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference 
between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance.3.1.2.2 Fair valueIf there is no active market for a financial instrument, fair value is determined either by using a valuation technique or independent third-party 
valuation service. Valuation techniques include using recent arm’s length market transactions between knowledgeable and willing parties, if 
available, referencing to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing 
models.The Company uses valuation models that are commonly used by market participants and customized for the Company to determine fair values of 
common over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives such as options, interest rate swaps and currency swaps which are based on the inputs observable 
in markets. For more complex instruments, the Company uses internally developed models, which are usually based on valuation methods and 
techniques generally used within the industry, or a value measured by an independent external valuation institution as the fair values if all or some 
of the inputs to the valuation models are not observable in market and therefore it is necessary to estimate fair value based on certain assumptions.In addition, the fair value information recognized in the statement of financial position is classified into the following fair value hierarchy, reflecting 
the significance of the input variables used in the fair value measurement.Level 1 : Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company can access at the measurement date
Level 2 : Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly
Level 3 : Unobservable inputs for the asset or liabilityThe fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to 
the entire measurement. For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety.If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment using unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 
measurement.f the valuation technique does not reflect all factors which market participants would consider in pricing the asset or liability, the fair value is 
adjusted to reflect those factors. Those factors include counterparty credit risk, bid-ask spread, liquidity risk and others.The Company uses valuation technique which maximizes the use of market inputs and minimizes the use of entity-specific inputs. It incorporates 
all factors that market participants would consider in pricing the asset or liability and is consistent with economic methodologies applied for pricing 
financial instruments. Periodically, the Company calibrates the valuation technique and tests its validity using prices of observable current market 
transactions of the same instrument or based on other relevant observable market data.3.1.3 DerecognitionDerecognition is the removal of a previously recognized financial asset or financial liability from the statement of financial position. The 
derecognition criteria for financial assets and financial liabilities are as follows:3.1.3.1 Derecognition of financial assetsA financial asset is derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or the Company transfers 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, or the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the financial asset and the Company has not retained control. Therefore, if the Company does not transfer substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the Company continues to recognize the financial asset to the extent of its continuing 
involvement in the financial asset.If the Company transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset but retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset, the Company continues to recognize the transferred asset in its entirety and recognize a financial liability for the 
consideration received.The Company writes off a financial asset when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a 
portion thereof. In general, the Company considers write-off when it is determined that the debtor does not have sufficient funds or income to 
cover the principal and interest. The write-off decision is made in accordance with internal regulations. After the write-off, the Company can 
collect the written-off loans continuously according to the internal policy. Recovered amounts from financial assets previously written-off are 
recognized in profit or loss.The Company uses quoted price in active market which is based on listed market price or dealer price quotations of financial instruments traded 
in active market as best estimate of fair value. A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and 
regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and 
regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis.3.1.3.2 Derecognition of financial liabilitiesA financial liability is derecognized from the statement of financial position when it is extinguished (i.e. the obligation specified in the contract is 
discharged, cancelled or expires).3.1.4 Offsetting3.4 Expected Credit Loss of Financial Assets (Debt Instruments)A financial asset and a financial liability is offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, 
the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to 
realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on a future event and must be 
legally enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company and all of the 
counterparties.The Company recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses at the end of the reporting period for financial assets at amortized cost and fair 
value through other comprehensive income except for financial asset at fair value through profit or loss.Expected credit losses are estimated at present value of probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible 
outcomes. The Company measures expected credit losses by reflecting all reasonable and supportable information that is available without 
undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.3.2 Cash and Due from Financial InstitutionsCash and due from financial institutions include cash on hand, foreign currency, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and due from financial institutions. Cash 
and due from financial institutions are measured at amortized cost.3.3 Non-derivative Financial Assets3.3.1 Financial assets at fair value through profit or lossFinancial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss unless they are classified as financial assets at amortized cost or at 
fair value through other comprehensive income.The Company may designate certain financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss when the designation eliminates 
or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as ‘an accounting mismatch’) that would otherwise 
arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on different bases.After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is measured at fair value and gains or losses arising from a change in 
fair value are recognized in profit or loss. Interest income using the effective interest method and dividend income from financial asset at fair value 
through profit or loss are also recognized in profit or loss.3.3.2 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive incomeThe Company classifies below financial assets as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income;-  Debt instruments that are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financialassets, and where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and;-  Equity instruments that are not held for short-term trading but held for strategic investment, and designated as financial assets at fair valuethrough other comprehensive incomeAfter initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income is measured at fair value. Gains or losses arising from a 
change in fair value, other than dividend income, interest income calculated using the effective interest method and exchange differences arising 
on monetary items which are recognized directly in profit or loss, are recognized as other comprehensive income in equity.When the financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is disposed, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other 
comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss. However, cumulative gain or loss of equity instrument designated as fair value 
through other comprehensive income is reclassified to retained earnings not to profit or loss at disposal.A financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income denominated in foreign currency is translated at the closing rate. Exchange 
difference resulting from change in amortized cost is recognized in profit or loss, and other changes are recognized in equity.3.3.3 Financial assets measured at amortized costA financial asset, which is held within the business model whose objective is achieved by collecting contractual cash flows, and where the assets’ 
cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, is classified as a financial asset at amortized cost. 
After initial recognition, a financial asset at amortized cost is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method and interest income is 
calculated using the effective interest method.The approaches of measuring expected credit losses in accordance with Korean IFRS are as follows:- General approach: for financial assets and unused loan commitments not subject to the below 2 approaches
- Simplified approach: for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables
- Credit-impaired approach: for financial assets that are credit-impaired at the time of acquisitionApplication of general approach is differentiated depending on whether credit risk has increased significantly after initial recognition. If the credit 
risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Company measures the loss allowance for that financial 
instrument at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses, whereas if the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly 
since initial recognition, the Company measures the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. 
Lifetime is presumed to be a period to the contractual maturity date of financial assets (the expected life of financial assets).The Company assesses whether the credit risk has increased significantly using the following information, and if one or more of the following 
conditions are met, it is deemed as significant increase in credit risk. If the contractual cash flows on a financial asset have been renegotiated or 
modified, the Company assesses whether the credit risk has increased significantly using the same following information.- More than 30 days past due
- Decline in credit rating at period end by more than certain notches as compared to that at initial recognition
- Debt restructuring (except for impaired financial assets) and
- Credit delinquency information of Korea Federation of Banks, etc.Under simplified approach, the Company always measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Under credit-
impaired approach, the Company only recognizes the cumulative changes in lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition as a loss 
allowance for purchased or originated creditimpaired financial assets. In assessing credit impairment, the Company uses definition of default as in 
the new Basel Accord which rules calculation of Capital Adequacy Ratio.The Company generally considers the loan to be credit-impaired if one or more of the following conditions are met:- 90 days or more past due
- Legal proceedings related to collection
- A borrower registered on the credit management list of Korea Federation of Banks
- A corporate borrower with the credit rating C or D
- Debt restructuring, etc.3.4.1 Forward-looking informationThe Company uses forward-looking information, when it assesses whether the credit risk has increased significantly and measures the expected 
credit losses.The Company assumes the risk components have a certain correlation with the economic cycle and uses statistical methodologies to estimate the 
relation between key macroeconomic variables and risk components for the expected credit losses.The correlation between the major macroeconomic variables and the credit risk are as follows;3.5 Revenue RecognitionKey macroeconomic variablesCorrelation between the major macroeconomicvariables and the credit riskDomestic GDP growth rate

(-)Forward-looking information used in calculation of expected credit losses is based on the macroeconomic forecasts utilized by the management 
of the Company for its business plan considering reliable external agency’s forecasts and others. The forward-looking information is generated 
by KB Research with comprehensive approach to capture the possibility of various economic forecast scenarios that are derived from the internal 
and external viewpoints of the macroeconomic situation. The Company determines the macroeconomic variables to be used in forecasting future 
condition of the economy, considering the direction of the forecast scenario and the significant relationship between macroeconomic variables 
and time series data. And there are some changes compared to the macroeconomic variables used in the previous year.3.4.2 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at amortized costThe expected credit losses of financial assets at amortized cost are measured as present value of the difference between the contractual cash 
flows that are due to the Company under the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. The Company estimates expected 
future cash flows for financial assets that are individually significant (individual assessment of impairment).For financial assets that are not individually significant, the Company collectively estimates expected credit loss by grouping loans with 
homogeneous credit risk profile (collective assessment of impairment).3.4.2.1 Individual assessment of impairmentIndividual assessment of impairment losses is calculated using management’s best estimate on present value of expected future cash flows. The 
Company uses all the available information including financial condition of the borrower such as operating cash flow and net realizable value of any 
collateral held.3.4.2.2 Collective assessment of impairmentCollective assessment of impairment losses is performed by using a methodology based on historical loss experience and reflecting forward-
looking information. Such process incorporates factors such as type of collateral, product and borrowers, credit rating, size of portfolio and 
recovery period and applies Probability of Default (“PD”) on a group of assets and Loss Given Default (“LGD”) by type of recovery method. Also, 
the expected credit loss model involves certain assumptions to determine input based on loss experience and forward-looking information. 
These models and assumptions are periodically reviewed to reduce gap between loss estimate and actual loss experience.The lifetime expected credit loss is measured by applying the PD to the carrying amount calculated by deducting the expected principal repayment 
amount from the carrying amount as of the reporting date and the LGD adjusted to reflect changes in the carrying amount.3.4.3 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive incomeThe Company measures expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income in a manner that is consistent 
with the requirements that are applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost. However, the loss allowance is recognized in other 
comprehensive income. Upon disposal or repayment of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, the amount of the loss 
allowance is reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss.The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the following steps determined in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1115 Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers.- Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer.
- Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
- Step 3: Determine the transaction price.
- Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
- Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.3.5.1 Interest income and expenseInterest income and expense on debt securities at fair value through profit or loss (excluding beneficiary certificates, equity investments and 
other debt securities), loans, financial instruments at amortized cost and debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income, are 
recognized in the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1109 Financial 
Instruments. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and allocating 
the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial 
instrument or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. 
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates expected cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the financial 
instrument but does not consider expected credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid (main components of effective interest 
rate only) or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other 
premiums or discounts. In those rare cases when it is not possible to estimate reliably the cash flows and the expected life of a financial instrument, 
the Company uses the contractual cash flows over the full contractual term of the financial instrument.Interest income on impaired financial assets is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the expected cash flows for the purpose of 
measuring the impairment loss.Interest income on debt securities at fair value through profit or loss is also classified as interest income in the statement of comprehensive income.3.5.2 Fee and commission incomeThe Company recognizes financial service fees in accordance with the purpose of charging the fees and the accounting standards of the financial 
instrument related to the fees earned.3.5.2.1 Fees that are an integral part of the effective interest of a financial instrumentSuch fees are generally treated as adjustments of effective interest. Such fees may include compensation for activities such as evaluating the 
borrower’s financial condition, evaluating and recording guarantees, collateral and other security arrangements, negotiating the terms of the 
instrument, preparing and processing documents and closing the transaction and origination fees received on issuing financial liabilities at amortized 
cost. However, fees relating to the creation or acquisition of a financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss are recognized as revenue 
immediately.3.5.2.2 Fees related to performance obligations satisfied over timeThe Company transfers control of a good or service over time, therefore, recognizes revenue related to performance obligations satisfied over the 
period of performance obligations. Fees which can be earned through the certain periods, including asset management fees, consignment business 
fees, etc. are recognized over the period of performance obligations.3.5.2.3 Fees related to performance obligations satisfied at a point in timeFees earned at a point in time are recognized as revenue when a customer obtains controls of a promised good or service and the Company 
satisfies a performance obligation.3.5.3 Net gains/losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or lossNet gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (including changes in fair value, dividends, and gains or losses from 
foreign currency translation) include gains and losses from following financial instruments:- Gains or losses relating to financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (excluding interest income using the effective interest rate)
- Gains or losses relating to derivatives for trading (including derivatives for hedging purpose but do not qualify for hedge accounting)3.5.4 Dividend incomeDividend income is recognized in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established. Dividend income is recognized as net gains or 
losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss or other operating income depending on the classification of equity securities.3.6 Investments in Subsidiaries and AssociatesInvestments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted at cost method in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1027. The Company determines at 
each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the investments in the subsidiaries and associates are impaired. If this is the 
case, the Company calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the subsidiaries or associates and 
its carrying value.3.7 Property and Equipment3.7.1 Recognition and measurementAll property and equipment that qualify for recognition as an asset are measured at cost and subsequently carried at its cost less any accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.The cost of property and equipment includes any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to 
be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and 
restoring the site on which it is located.Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when they prolong the useful life or enhance values of the assets but the costs of the day-to-day 
servicing of the assets such as repair and maintenance costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. When part of an item of property and 
equipment has a useful life different from that of the entire asset, it is recognized as a separate asset.3.7.2 DepreciationLand is not depreciated, whereas other property and equipment are depreciated using the method that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s 
future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Company. The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its 
residual value.Each part of an item of property and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.The depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows:Intangible assets, except for membership rights, are amortized using the straight-line method with no residual value over their estimated useful 
economic life since the asset is available for use.Intangible assetsAmortization methodEstimated useful lifeSoftware
OthersStraight-line
Straight-line4 years4 ~ 19 yearsThe amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. 
Where an intangible asset is not being amortized because its useful life is indefinite, the Company carries out a review in each accounting period to 
confirm whether events and circumstances still support an indefinite useful life assessment. If they do not, the change in the useful life assessment 
from indefinite to finite is accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.9 Impairment of Non-financial AssetsThe Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset, except for (a) deferred 
income tax assets, (b) assets arising from employee benefits and (c) non-current assets (or group of assets to be sold) classified as held for sale, 
may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.The recoverable amount is estimated for the individual asset. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, the 
Company determines the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. A cash-generating unit is the smallest 
identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. 
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the 
future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit that are discounted by a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. That 
reduction is an impairment loss and recognized immediately in profit or loss.3.10 ProvisionsProvisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching the 
best estimate of provisions, and where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of provisions is the present value of the 
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provisions are reversed.3.11 Equity Instrument Issued by the CompanyProperty and equipmentLeasehold improvements

4 years3.11.1 Ordinary sharesThe residual value, the useful life and the depreciation method applied to an asset are reviewed at each financial year-end and, if expectations 
differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.11.2 Hybrid securities3.8 Intangible AssetsIntangible assets are measured initially at cost and subsequently carried at their cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated 
impairment losses.The financial instruments can be classified as either financial liabilities or equity in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Company 
classifies hybrid securities as an equity if the Company has the unconditional right to avoid any contractual obligation to deliver financial assets 
such as cash in relation to the financial instruments.Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or the exercise of stock option are 
deducted from the equity, net of any tax effects.3.12 Employee Compensation and Benefits3.12.1 Post-employment benefits:3.12.1.1 Defined contribution plans3.13 Income Tax ExpensesIncome tax expense comprises current tax expense and deferred income tax expense. Current and deferred income tax are recognized as income 
or expense and included in profit or loss for the period, except to the extent that the tax arises from (a) a transaction or event which is recognized, 
in the same or a different period, outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and (b) a business combination.When an employee has rendered service to the Company during a period, the Company recognizes the contribution payable to a defined 
contribution plan in exchange for that service as post-employment benefits for the period.3.13.1 Current income tax3.12.1.2 Defined benefit plansAll post-employment benefits, other than defined contribution plans, are classified as defined benefit plans. The amount recognized as a net 
defined benefit liability is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the end of the reporting period.The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit method. The 
rate used to discount post-employment benefit obligations is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on 
high quality corporate bonds. The currency and term of the corporate bonds are consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-
employment benefit obligations. Actuarial gains and losses resulted from changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments are 
recognized in other comprehensive income.When the total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation minus the fair value of plan assets results in an asset, it is recognized to the 
extent of the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods, resulting from the 
introduction or changes to a defined benefit plan. Such past service cost is immediately recognized as an expense for the period.3.12.2 Short-term employee benefitsShort-term employee benefits are employee benefits that are expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the annual 
reporting period in which the employees render the related service. When an employee has rendered service to the Company during an accounting 
period, the Company recognizes the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service as an 
expense for the period.The expected cost of profit-sharing and bonus payments is recognized as liabilities when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation 
to make payments as a result of past events, such as service rendered by employees, and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.3.12.3 Share-based paymentThe Company has provided stock grants program to directors and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. When stock grants are exercised, 
the Company can either select to distribute newly issued shares or treasury shares or compensate in cash based on the share price.For a share-based payment transaction in which the terms of the arrangement provide the Company with the choice of whether to settle in cash 
or by issuing equity instruments, the Company accounts for the transaction in accordance with the requirements applying to cash-settled share-
based payment transactions because the Company determines that it has a present obligation to settle in cash because the Company has a past 
practice and a stated policy of settling in cash.Therefore, the Company measures the liability incurred as consideration for the service, at fair value and recognizes related expense and accrued 
expense over the vesting periods. Until the liability is settled, the Company remeasures the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting 
period and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss as share-based payments.3.12.4 Termination benefitsTermination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Company before the normal retirement date, or an employee’s decision 
to accept an offer of benefits in exchange for the termination of employment. The Company recognizes a liability and expense for termination 
benefits at the earlier of the following dates; when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Company 
recognizes costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of Korean IFRS No.1037 and involves the payment of termination benefits. If the 
termination benefits are not expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the annual reporting period, then the termination 
benefits are discounted to present value.Current income tax is the amount of income tax payable in respect of the taxable profit (loss) for the period. A difference between the taxable profit 
and accounting profit may arise when income or expense is included in accounting profit in one period but is included in taxable profit in a different 
period. Differences may also arise if there is revenue that is exempt from taxation, or expense that is not deductible in determining taxable profit (loss). 
Current income tax liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the end of the reporting period.The Company offsets current income tax assets and current income tax liabilities if, and only if, the Company (a) has a legally enforceable right to 
set off the recognized amounts and (b) intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.3.13.2 Deferred income taxDeferred income tax is recognized, using the asset-liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax-based amount of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amount in the financial statements. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. However, deferred income tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the 
initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, and at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.The carrying amount of a deferred income tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The Company reduces the carrying amount of 
a deferred income tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or 
all of that deferred income tax asset to be utilized.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or 
the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The 
measurement of deferred income tax liabilities and deferred income tax assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in 
which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.The Company offsets deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities if, and only if the Company has a legally enforceable right to set 
off current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities relate 
to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle 
current income tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which 
significant amounts of deferred income tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.3.13.3 Uncertain tax positionsUncertain tax positions arise from tax treatments applied by the Company which may be challenged by the tax authorities due to the complexity of 
the transaction or different interpretation of the tax laws, a claim for rectification brought by the Company, an appeal for a refund claimed from the 
tax authorities related to additional assessments or a tax investigation by the tax authorities. The Company recognizes its uncertain tax positions 
in the financial statements in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1012 and Interpretation of Korean IFRS No.2123. The income tax asset is recognized 
if a tax refund is probable for taxes paid and levied by the tax authority, and the amount to be paid as a result of the tax investigation and others 
is recognized as the current tax payable. However, additional dues on tax paid or refund are recognized in accordance with Korean IFRS No.1037 
because those are, in substance, interest and penalty.3.14 Earnings per ShareThe Company calculates basic earnings per share amounts and diluted earnings per share amounts for profit or loss for the period and presents 
them in the statement of comprehensive income. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity 
holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted 
earnings per share, the Company adjusts profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company, and the weighted average number of 
shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares including convertible bonds and share options.3.15 LeaseThe Company as a lessor recognizes lease payments from operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs 
incurred in obtaining an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the underlying asset and recognized as expense over the lease term 
on the same basis as lease income. The respective leased assets are included in the statement of financial position based on their nature.A lessee is required to recognize a right-of-use asset (lease assets) representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability 
representing its obligation to make lease payments. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured at the present value.Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:- Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable
- Variable lease payment that are depend on an index or a rate
- Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees
- The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and
- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the leaseThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be 
readily determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, which is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a 
similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic 
environment.Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:- The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability
- Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received
- Any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee, and
- An estimate of restoration costsHowever, the Company can elect not to apply the requirements of Korean IFRS No.1116 to short-term lease (lease that, at the commencement date, 
has a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value (for example, underlying leased asset under $ 5,000).The right-of-use asset is depreciated from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end 
of the lease term.For sale and leaseback transactions, the Company applies the requirements of Korean IFRS No.1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to 
determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale of that asset.3.16 Operating SegmentsThe Company is composed of a single operating segment. Therefore, information of operating segments is not disclosed in accordance with Korean 
IFRS No.1108 Operating Segments.4. Financial Risk Management

through other comprehensive income. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are excluded. Expected credit losses are a probability-weighted 
estimate of possible credit losses occurred in a certain range by reflecting reasonable and supportable information that is reasonably available at the 
reporting date without undue cost or effort, including information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. 
The Company measures the expected credit losses of loans classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost, by deducting allowances for 
credit losses. The expected credit losses of loans classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are presented in other 
comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements.Credit qualities of loans measured at amortized cost as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are classified as follows:4.2.5 Credit risk of due from financial institutionsDecember 31, 2020(In millions of Korean won)Credit qualities of due from financial institutions as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:(In millions of Korean won)12-month expectedcredit lossesLifetime expected credit losses

2  Hybrid securities included in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are included in the ‘Over 5 years’ category since the timing of disposal is 
uncertain.-  Additional Tier 1 Capital: Additional Tier 1 Capital includes capital, capital surplus, etc. related to the issuance of capital securities of a permanentnature that meets the conditional capital securities requirements.-  Tier 2 Capital means capital that can compensate for losses of the Group upon liquidation, including (a) the amount of subordinated bonds with 
maturity of not less than 5 years that meet the conditional capital securities requirements, and (b) the allowance for credit losses accumulated on 
the loans which are classified as normal or precautionary in accordance with Regulation on Supervision of Financial Holding Companies and others.The risk-weighted assets are the magnitude of the amount of risk inherent in the total asset held by the Group. The Group calculates risk-weighted 
assets by each risk (credit risk, market risk, and operational risk) based on the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory Regulations on 
Financial Holding Companies and uses them to calculate BIS ratio.The Company evaluates and manages capital adequacy through separate internal policies. The valuation of capital adequacy compares the 
size of available capital (the amount of capital actually available) to the size of internal capital (the amount of capital required to cover all the 
significant risks faced by the Company under its target credit rating), which monitors financial soundness and provides a risk-adjusted performance 
measurement basis.Internal capital refers to the capital required to prevent the Group’s insolvency from future unexpected losses. The Company operates a system to 
measure, allocate and manage internal capital to major subsidiaries by risk type.The Risk Management Committee of the Company determines the risk appetite of the Group, allocates internal capital by risk type and major 
subsidiaries, and major subsidiaries operate capital efficiently within the range of the allocated internal capital. The Risk Management Department 
of the Company monitors internal capital limit management and reports it to the management and the Risk Management Committee. If the limit of 
internal capital is expected to be exceeded due to new businesses or business expansion, the Group’s capital adequacy management is carried out 
through review and approval by the Risk Management Committee in advance.Details of the Company’s capital adequacy calculation in accordance with Basel III requirements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:Equity Capital:

13.584.4 Market Risk4.4.1 ConceptMarket risk refers to risks that can result in losses due to changes in market factors such as interest rates, stock prices, and exchange rates etc. The 
Company manages the market risks by dividing them into those arising from the trading position and those arising from the non-trading position.4.4.2 Trading positionIn accordance with Financial Holding Companies Act, the Company’s main business is to control financial companies or companies closely related 
to the financial service. And the Company cannot perform any other business other than managing activities as a holding company, therefore there 
is no risk of trading position.4.4.3 Non-trading positionNon-trading position refers to the part except trading position, and the main risk the Company is managing is interest rate risk.4.4.3.1 Interest rate risk(a) Definition of interest rate riskInterest rate risk refers to the risk of changes in the value (fair value) of the items in the statement of financial position due to changes in interest 
rates and the risk of changes in cash flows related to interest income and interest expense arising from investment and financing activities.(b) Observation method and management indicator on interest rate riskThe main objective of interest rate risk management is to protect the value changes from interest rate fluctuations. The Company manages interest 
rate risk through the measurement and management of interest rate VaR.(c) Interest rate VaRInterest rate VaR is the maximum possible loss of net assets due to the negative changes of interest rate at a 99.9% confidence level. The 
measurement results of risk as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:Interest rate VaR *(In millions of Korean won)December 31, 2020December 31, 2019₩237,338₩146,472*  Interest rate risk is measured based on the method of Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (“IRRBB”) from the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest rate VaRas of December 31, 2019 was calculated based on the method of Historical Simulation VaR.4.5 Capital AdequacyThe Company as a financial holding company under the Financial Holding Companies Act, complies with the consolidated capital adequacy 
standard established by the Financial Services Commission. This capital adequacy standard is based on Basel III revised by Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision in Bank for International Settlements in June 2011 and was implemented in Korea in December 2013. The Group is required to 
maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 8.0%, a minimum Tier 1 ratio of 9.5% and a minimum Total Regulatory Capital ratio of 
11.5% as of December 31, 2020.The Company’s equity capital is classified into three categories in accordance with the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory 
Regulations on Financial Holding Companies:-  Common Equity Tier 1 Capital: Common equity Tier 1 Capital is the first to take losses in the Group and is the last to be compensated in 
liquidation of the Company and not repaid except for liquidation. It includes capital, capital surplus, retained earnings, non-controlling interests of 
the consolidated subsidiaries, accumulated other comprehensive income and other capital surplus etc.5.

5,646,157Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants. The Company discloses the fair value of each class of assets and liabilities in a way that permits it to be compared with its carrying 
amount at the end of each reporting period. The best evidence of fair value of financial instruments is quoted price in an active market.Methods of determining fair value of financial instruments are as follows:Cash and due
from financial
institutionsSecuritiesDerivativesCarrying amounts of cash and demand due from financial institutions and payment due from financial institutions are a 
reasonable approximation of fair values. These financial instruments do not have a fixed maturity and are receivable on 
demand. Fair value of ordinary due from financial institutions is measured using DCF model (Discounted Cash Flow Model).Fair value of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets is determined using the quoted prices. If there is no 
quoted price, fair value is determined using external professional valuation institution. The institutions use one or more of  
the following valuation techniques including DCF Model, Imputed Market Value Model, Free Cash Flow to Equity Model, 
Dividend Discount Model, Risk Adjusted Discount Rate Method, and Net Asset Value Method, deemed suitable considering  
the characteristics of the financial instruments.For exchange traded derivatives, quoted price in an active market is used to determine fair value and for OTC derivatives,  
fair value is determined using valuation techniques. The Company uses internally developed valuation models that are widely 
used by market participants to determine fair values of plain vanilla OTC derivatives including options, interest rate swaps,  
and currency swaps, based on observable market parameters. However, some complex financial instruments are valued using 
appropriate models developed from generally accepted market valuation models including the Finite Difference Method  
and the MonteCarlo Simulation or valuation results from independent external professional valuation institution.Loans measured at
amortized costDCF model is used to determine the fair value of loans. Fair value is determined by discounting the expected cash flows,  
which are contractual cash flows adjusted by the expected prepayment rate, at an appropriate discount rate.BorrowingsDebenturesDCF model is used to determine the fair value of borrowings, but in the case of short-term maturity, the carrying amount is 
used as the fair value.Fair value is determined by using the valuation results of external professional valuation institution, which are calculated  
using market inputs.Other financial
assets and liabilitiesCarrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair values. These financial instruments are temporary accounts used  
for other various transactions and their maturities are relatively short or not defined.5.1.2 Fair value hierarchy
The Company believes that valuation methods used for measuring the fair values of financial instruments are reasonable and that the fair values 
recognized in the statements of financial position are appropriate. However, the fair values of the financial instruments recognized in the statements 
of financial position may be different if other valuation methods or assumptions are used. Additionally, as there is a variety of valuation techniques 
and assumptions used in measuring fair value, it may be difficult to reasonably compare the fair value with that of other financial institutions.The Group classifies and discloses fair value of the financial instruments into the three-level hierarchy as follows:Level 1 :  The fair values are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at themeasurement date.Level 2 :  The fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, eitherdirectly or indirectly.Level 3 : The fair values are based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.The fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to 
the entire measurement. If an observable input requires an adjustment using an unobservable input and that adjustment results in a significantly 
higher or lower fair value measurement, the resulting measurement would be categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.5.1.2.1 Fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities at fair value in the statements of financial position
Fair value hierarchy of financial assets at fair value in the statements of financial position as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:Financial assets

5,646,1571 Because due from financial institutions classified as level 2 are deposits on demand, carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values.
2  Because loans measured at amortized cost classified as level 3 are loans with residual maturity of less than one year, carrying amounts are reasonable 
approximations of fair values.
3  For other financial assets and other financial liabilities classified as level 3, carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values.
4  For borrowings classified as Level 2, carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values.Valuation techniques and inputs of financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 and measured at fair value in the statements of financial

using market data; such as, interest rates, future salary increase rate and mortality rate based on historical data. Actuarial assumptions may differ 
from actual results, due to changes in the market, economic trends and mortality trends.17.2 Changes in net defined benefit liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:(In millions of Korean won)17.4  Details of post-employment benefits recognized in profit or loss as employee compensation and benefits for the years endedDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:Present valueof defined benefitobligation2020Fair value of

number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The 
Company has categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares such as stock grants and ordinary share exchange rights of exchangeable bonds.A calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average market share price 
for the year) based on the monetary value of stock grants. The number of shares calculated above is compared with the number of shares that 
would have been issued assuming the settlement of stock grants.In addition, exchangeable bonds issued for the year ended December 31, 2020, were included in potential ordinary shares from the exercisable date 
of the exchange right, and interest expenses after tax for the period were added to profit for diluted earnings per share.28.2.1 Adjusted profit for diluted earnings per shareProfit attributable to the ordinary equity holders *

potential impairment of assets in a particular portfolio, which can negatively affect the profit generation capability of the Company as follows;– There is a possibility of uncertainty about the credit risk of a borrower that could be affected by COVID-19.
– Uncertainty may arise about forward-looking macroeconomic information related to expected credit losses.
–  Korean won may depreciate against major foreign currencies. This may result in an increase in principal and interest payments on liabilitiesdenominated in foreign currencies, and losses on foreign exchanges transactions.– A significant decrease in the fair value of the Company’s investment in an entity that could be affected by COVID-19 pandemic can occur.31.

in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information, and our report dated March 9, 2021 expressed an unmodified opinion on those separate financial statements.Basis for Opinion

the Internal Control over Financial ReportingDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with Korean International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“K-IFRS”). A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with K-IFRS, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Young-Min Kwon.KPMG Samjong Accounting Corp.
