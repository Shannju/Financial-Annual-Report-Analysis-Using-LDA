Customer equipment increased, reflecting the potentialfor organic growth through revenue synergies of the Group’s Universal Customer-focused Banking model.-In Savings/Retirement, outstandings (savings, retirement and death & disability) reached €304 billion,up +6.6% compared to December 2018, of which 22.8% are unit-linked, up +1.8 percentage points year-on-year. Premium income reached €6.0 billion for fourth quarter 2019 (down -12.0% compared to fourth 
quarter 2018), as a result of a decrease in total net inflows of  -€1.1 billion compared to fourth quarter2018 to €1.0 billion. Net inflows were entirely unit-linked, with unit-linked contracts accounting for 33.4%of gross inflows in fourth quarter 2019, up +4.4 percentage points compared to fourth quarter 2018 and 
+4.2 percentage points compared to the previous quarter. For several years, Crédit Agricole Assuranceshas  been  adapting  its  strategy  to  the  low  interest  rate  environment  and  has  significant  flexibility  withregard to this situation.

the stock of Policyholder Participation Reserve (PPE) reached €10.8 billion at the end of December 2019,an  increase  of  +€948  million  compared  to  December  2018,  thanks  to  the  maintenance  of  the  spreadbetween the return on assets and the return on liabilities.

Thesolvency  of  Crédit  Agricole  Assurances  is  at a comfortable level  (263%  and 188%  excluding  the new 
rules for the integration of the PPE). Crédit Agricole Assurances also continues to adopt measures toencourage unit-linked underwriting.-In Property and Casualty insurance, Crédit Agricole Assurances continued to outperform the Frenchmarket, with premium growth of +6.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by continued strong growthin France (+6.9%) and Italy (+1.6%).

2019, i.e. a +1.7 percentage point increase since December 2018). The combined ratio is well managedat 95.9%, slightly in increase of +0.4 percentage point year-on-year, due to the weather events in the 
second half of the year.

Assets under managementreached €1,653 billion at end-December 2019, up +16.0% compared  to end-December 2018, despitecontinuing uncertainty in the global environment.-  Retail banking is still showing strong sales momentum, with high rates of credit growth, particularly inFrance for LCL (up +8.2% compared to end-December 2018), thanks to home loans (+9.2%), the smallbusinesses market (+11.4%) and corporates (+3.3%), but also in Italy for CA Italia (+2.6%), driven by 
loans to individuals (+4.9%) and corporates (+4.3%). Renegotiations of housing loans have  increasedfor  the  past  two  quarters  at  LCL  (€1.0  billion  in  outstandings  respectively  in  the  third  quarter  and  thefourth quarter 2019), but remain well below the high point of the fourth quarter 2016 (€5.2 billion). LCL’s 
inflows increased year-on-year (+7.6%), driven by on-balance sheet deposits (+8.6%, including +7.8%for passbooks and +11.7% for demand deposits) but also by off-balance sheet deposits (+6.0%) thanksto life insurance (+5.5%). Inflows were up in Italy (+4.9%), thanks to strong growth in off-balance sheet 
deposits (+8.8%) and a slight increase in on-balance sheet deposits (+1.6%).

conditions that became more favourable after a low fourth quarter 2018. Despite the absence of majortransactions, structured finance recorded a good performance this quarter (+7.2%), while revenues  incommercial banking were penalized (-2.3%) by the downturn in the syndicated EMEA loans market (-

It will combine the activities ofCACEIS  and  Santander Securities Services  (“S3”)  in  Spain  and  Latin  America  (Brazil,  Mexico  andColombia). This new entity, with €3,879 billion in assets under custody and €2,047 billion of assets under 
administration  at  the  end  of  December  2019,  will  benefit  from  the  increase  in  its  critical  size  and  astrengthened  competitive  positioning,  thanks  to  a  broader  geographic  presence  stemming  from  thegrowth of high-potential countries (Latin America and Asia).-  On  20  December  2019,  Amundi  and  BOC  Wealth  Management,  a  subsidiary  of  Bank  of  China,announced  that  they  had  received  the  approval  from  the  China  Banking  and  Insurance  RegulatoryCommission to create an asset management joint venture.

share. They include the favourable decision of France's Council of State (Conseil d’Etat) on the tax treatmentdispute regarding the Emporiki securities in the amount of +€1,038 million, the costs of integration and acquisitionby  CACEIS  of  Santander  and  Kas  Bank  (respectively  -€15  million  in  operatingl  expenses/-€11  million  in  net 
income Group share, and  -€6 million  in  net  income on other  assets/-€5 million  in net  income Group share), areclassification  of  held-for-sale  operations  of  -€46  million  under  income  from  held-for-sale  operations.  Theacquisition  of  Kas  Bank  by  CACEIS  resulted  in  badwill  of  +€22 million  and  the  goodwill  of  LCL  was  partially 
impaired  for  -€611 million.  To  this  is  can  be  added  the  recurring  accounting  volatility  items  with  a  limited  netnegative effect of -€44 million on net income Group share, namely DVA (Debt Valuation Adjustment, i.e. gainsand losses on financial instruments related to changes in the Group’s issuer spread), plus the Funding Valuation 
Adjustment  (FVA)  portion  associated  with  the  change  in  the  issuer  spread,  which  is  not  hedged,  totalling  -€4 million,  the  hedge  on  the  Large customers  loan  book  for  -€11 million,  and  the  change  in  the  provision  for 
home purchase savings plans for -€29 million. In the fourth quarter 2018, specific items had a limited net loss 
effect of -€59 million on net income Group share, and included in particular the fine of -€67 million imposedby the Italian competition authority (AGCM) on FCA Bank. The other elements were less significant: -€27 million(-€14 million in net income Group share) Pioneer integration costs at Amundi, the integration costs of the three 
Italian banks of -€11 million (-€6 million in net income Group share), offset by a net profit of +€28 million in netincome Group share from the recurring volatile accounting items, namely the DVA (Debt Valuation Adjustment,i.e. gains and losses on financial instruments linked to changes in the Group's issuer spread) for +€11 million, 
the hedging of the Large customers loan book for +€12 million, and changes in provisions for home purchasesavings plans for +€5 million.The business lines performed strongly in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Underlying net income Group share of 
business lines12 increased by +12.8%. This strong increase is explained in particular by the Large customers and 
Asset gathering business lines. The former posted a very good performance this quarter (+30.1% at €408 million),driven by capital markets. Its contribution increased despite the reversal of the cost of risk in the business line 
and  the  increase in  operating  expenses  related  to the  integration of  new  partnerships  in asset  servicing.  TheAsset gathering business line had a strong quarter (+13.8% at €583 million), illustrated by a solid contributionfrom insurance and by high profitability in asset management. In Retail Banking, gross operating income rose 
sharply  (+6.7%  to  €525  million),  and  the  cost  of  risk  continued  to  fall  at  CA  Italia.  The  Specialised  financial12 Excluding the Corporate Centre.Results for the fourth quarter and full year 20196/32services  business  line  posted  resilient  gross  operating  income  (+1.8%  at  €341  million)  thanks  to  good  costcontrol.In fourth quarter 2019, underlying revenues totalled €5,184 million (+7.7%). This rapid growth was driven bydynamic  commercial  activity  across  all  businesses,  in  particular  within  the  Large  customers  business  line(+20.7%) in market conditions that became more favourable over the course of the year. The increase in revenues 
was also strong in the Asset gathering business line (+10.4%) with record inflows for Amundi, dynamic unit-linkedassets and a better performance than the French property and casualty insurance market. The Retail bankingbusiness line continues to grow in terms of customer acquisition and business. Interest revenues held up well, 
despite the low interest rate environment both in France and internationally. Volume effect helped  therefore tomaintain the net interest margin, even in the low interest rates context. For all of the business lines (excludingthe Corporate Centre), underlying revenues were up +8.4% this quarter.These  positive  revenue  trends  were  accompanied  by  good  cost  control.  Underlying  operating  expensesshowed a controlled increase of +2.2% compared to fourth quarter 2018. This enabled significantly positivejaws of +5.5 percentage points. Expenses nevertheless continued to rise in the business lines (+3.3% between 
the fourth quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2019), in particular for those that are growing their activities.In particular, the Asset gathering business line showed an increase in expenses reflecting the development  ininternational  insurance  activity  and  corporate  P&C  projects  (this  effect  is  cumulative  with  a  base  effect  on 
insurance  compared  to  the  fourth  quarter 2018).  In  Asset  management,  the  increase  in  expenses  can  beexplained by the increase in variable compensation (linked to solid performance), and by one-off costs linked tostrategic projects. Large customers posted a sharply improved cost/income ratio on corporate and investment 
banking  (-9.1  percentage  points  over  the  period)  and  Asset  servicing  made  investments  to  support  recentpartnerships  and  customer  acquisition  (FTEs  and  IT  costs).  Retail  Banking  posted  cost  income  ratioimprovements  for  LCL  (-1.7  percentage  points  in  fourth  quarter  2019  and  for  the  year)  and  CA  Italia  (-0.7 
percentage  points  in  fourth  quarter  2019/-0.5  percentage  points  for  the  year)  thanks  to  positive  jaws.  TheSpecialised 
the  period.  The 
underlying cost/income ratio stood at 62.6% for fourth quarter 2019 for Crédit Agricole S.A., an improvementrecorded  good  cost  control  overfinancial  services  businesslineof +3.4 percentage points over the period.Underlying gross operating income therefore strongly increased, by +18.3% compared to the fourth quarterof 2018.Cost  of  risk  increased  by  +38.0%/-€94  million,  to  -€340 million  versus  -€246 million in  fourth  quarter  2018,mainly due to a return to a normal level of the cost of credit risk in Corporate and Investment Banking,  whichreported net reversals of provisions for +€28 million in fourth quarter 2018, while it reported net  provisions of -
€55 million (i.e., a -€83 million variation) in this quarter. For the same reason, we are seeing a return to normal 
levels in the cost of risk on consolidated outstandings13 for fourth quarter 2019. It stood at 32 basis points, 
up +9 basis points versus fourth quarter 2018 and up +3 basis points versus the previous quarter, but it remained 
low. The other three business lines that contributed the most to the cost of risk show contrasting variations, albeitof very limited magnitude. LCL thus posted a +2.7% increase in the cost of risk, to -€64 million, but its cost of riskrelative to outstandings remained low at 17 basis points (stable compared to the previous quarter). CA Italia was 
down -4.0%, with the cost of risk on outstandings continuing to improve, standing at 57 basis points (comparedto 67 points in the fourth quarter 2018 and 59 points in the third quarter 2019); lastly, Crédit Agricole ConsumerFinance recorded a +40.6% increase in the cost of risk to €115 million compared to the fourth quarter 2018, with 
a cost of risk on outstandings that also rose to 128 basis points. This remains, however, in the 120-130 basispoints range, and well below the Medium-Term Plan's assumption of 160 basis points.The  contribution  of  equity-accounted  entities  is  up  +2.6%,  at  €76 million,  reflecting,  in  particular,  the  goodperformance of the Joint-Ventures in asset management for the quarter, thanks to India.Net  income  from  other  assets  was €20  million,  as  a  result  of  a  one-off  real  estate  transaction  in  Wealth 
management. Underlying income14 before tax, discontinued operations and non-controlling interests thus 
increased by +17.1% to €1,697 million. The underlying effective tax rate was 13.5%, a low level, down-2.613 Average loan loss reserves over the last four rolling quarters, annualised

The underlying tax charge was therefore down -1.0% 
to €219 million. The effective tax rate is not representative on a quarterly basis, at end-2019 it amounted to 24.4% 
(vs 23.8% in 2018). The underlying net income before non-controlling interests was up by +20.3%.Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was stable (-0.6%) at €161 million.Underlying net income Group share increased by +23.5% versus fourth quarter 2018, to €1,318 million.Over the whole of 2019, stated net income Group share amounted to €4,844 million, compared to €4,400 millionin 2018, an increase of +10.1%.Specific  items  in 2019  had  an  impact  of  +€262 million  on  stated net income Group share.  In  addition  to  thefourth quarter items already mentioned above, items for the first nine months of 2019 had a limited net negative 
impact of -€81 million on net income Group share; they included recurring volatile accounting items such asthe  Debt  Valuation Adjustment  (DVA,  i.e. gains  and  losses  on  financial  instruments  related  to changes  in  theGroup’s issuer spread), plus the portion of the Funding Value Adjustment (FVA) associated with the change in

€50 million.  Specific items  in 2018  had  a  limited  negative  impact  of  -€5 million  on  stated net  income Groupshare. Compared to the fourth quarter 2018 items already mentioned above, they had an impact of +€54 millionfor the first nine months of 2018, i.e. the adjustment of negative goodwill recognised at the time of acquisition ofthe three Italian savings banks of +€66 million, the Pioneer integration costs of -€14 million (-€30 million before

-1.1 ppFor the year 2019, business line results were up +4.0%, thanks to growth in activity of all business lines and tocontrolled growth in expenses (positive jaws of +1.8 percentage points), and despite the cost of risk returning toa normal level. With regard to the negative result of the Corporate Centre division (-€813 million, compared to -
€731 million in 2018), the “structural” contribution improved by +€72 million to -€881 million in 2019, mainly dueto an improvement in the contribution from the activities and functions of Crédit Agricole S.A.’s corporate centre:At the same time, the other items contributed positively in the amount of +€68 million in full year 2019, a cleardecrease compared to full year 2018 (+€222 million).Underlying revenues were up +3.3% compared to 2018, with a positive contribution to this growth of all businesslines except Specialised financial services. Consumer finance is evolving in an environment of strong competitive 
pressure  in  France  over  the  period,  and  the  good  performance  of  the  automotive  partnerships  is  equity-accounted. Leasing and factoring posted higher revenues, supported by very buoyant business. Revenues fromthe  Large  customers  business  line  increased  sharply  (+6.5%),  due  to  the  sales  momentum  in  all  businessactivities, in market conditions that have become more favourable in 2019.Underlying  operating  expenses  increased  slightly,  by  +1.5%,  excluding  SRF  contributions.  This  control  ofexpenses led to positive jaws of +1.8 percentage points over the period. In the business lines alone, the increaseamounted to +2.0%, centring mainly on the Asset gathering and Large customers business lines, which saw their 
expenses increase in line with the development of their activities. The underlying cost/income ratio excludingSRF  was  61.0%,  including  IFRIC21  expenses  in  the  first  quarter,  an  improvement  of  1.1  percentage  pointscompared to 2018.Lastly, the cost of credit risk showed an increase of +25.5%/-€254 million compared to 2018, to -€1,256 million.This increase is mainly due to the Large customers business line (which reported a risk charge of -€160 million 
at  end-December  2019,  compared  to  a  net  reversal  of  +€64  million  at  end-December  2018),  and  Financingactivities in particular, stemming from a progressive return to a normal level in the cost of risk and to the one-offcharges reported in the period.Results for the fourth quarter and full year 20199/32Financial solidityAt end-December 2019, the solvency  of Crédit Agricole S.A. remains at a high level,  with a Common EquityTier 1 (CET1) ratio of 12.1%, up +0.4 percentage point compared to end-September 2019. This increase isspecifically explained by the significant positive impact of +32 basis points related to the favourable outcome of 
the  tax  treatment  dispute  regarding  the  Emporiki  equity  investments  generating  a  gain  in  income  of+€1,038 million, this profit will be allocated in its entirety to financing the partial dismantling of 35% of the Switchguarantee as early  as  the  first quarter  2020 (expected impact of approximately  -40 basis  points  on  the CET1 
ratio). Excluding this impact the ratio remained broadly stable for the quarter: generation of capital (+16 basispoints, including a dividend provision of €0.23 for the quarter, bringing the dividend to €0.70 for the 2019 financialyear) and a significant decline in risk-weighted assets (+18 basis points) offset the decline in OCI reserve (-10 
basis points) in the context of rising interest rates, as well as other impacts (merger of CACEIS and Santanderfor -5 basis points, additional sale of BSF shares for +8 basis points, regulatory for -8 basis points).Risk-weighted assets totalled €324 billion at end-December 2019 and fell sharply in the fourth quarter of 
2019 (-€6.6 billion/-2.0%), notably due to securitisation transactions in corporate and investment banking and adecline in the equity-accounted value of insurance investments. (-€3.1 billion).The phased-in leverage ratio was 4.2% at end-December 2019. The intra-quarter average measure of phased-
in leverage ratio16 stood at 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019.Crédit Agricole S.A.’s  average  LCR  (Liquidity  Coverage  Ratio)  over  12  months  stood  at  131.6%17  at  end-
December 2019, which is higher than the target level of around 110% set out in the Medium-Term Plan.At the end of December 2019, Crédit Agricole S.A. had realised 97% of its medium-to-long-term marketfunding  programmeforthe  year.  The  bankraisedthe  equivalent  of  €16.4 billion,  of  which€10.1 billion equivalent  of  senior preferred debt  and  senior secured debt,  and  €4.5  billion equivalent  of 
senior non-preferred debt  and  €1.8  billion equivalent  of Tier 2 debt.  The  2020 programme is  set at €12 billion,including  around  €5 to €6 billion of  TLAC  eligible  debt  (Tier  2  debt  or  senior  non-preferred  debt).  At  end  ofJanuary 2020, 22% of the funding plan was completed.Note that in 2019 Crédit Agricole S.A. carried out:  a senior non-preferred Green Bond issue for €1 billion (included in the amounts above). 
  a CAHL SFH senior secured Green Bond issue for an amount of €1.25 billion (included in the amountsabove).  a senior preferred Panda Bond issue in the amount of CNY 1 billion (included in the amounts above).An AT1 instrument was also issued for €1.1 billion equivalent in February 2019 (not included in the funding plan).***16 Intra-quarter leverage refers to the average of the end of month exposures for the first two months of said quarter. 
17 The ratio’s numerator and denominator stand at €189.3 billion and €143.8 billion, respectively, for Crédit Agricole S.A.Results for the fourth quarter and full year 201910/32Philippe Brassac, Chief Executive Officer, commented on the fourth quarter 2019 and full year 2019 results and 
activity  of  Crédit  Agricole  S.A.  as  follows:  « Underlying  net  income  of  Crédit  Agricole  S.A.  is  up  +23.5%  this 
quarter,  and  +4.0%  for  the  year.  All  business  lines  contributed  to  this  annual  growth,  thanks  to  dynamiccommercial activity, which resulted in a net gain of 370,000 individual customers and entrepreneurs in Franceand  Italy  this  year;  revenue  synergies  reached  €9  billion  within  the  Group,  demonstrating  our  organic  growth 
potential. Lastly, the business lines of Credit Agricole S.A., in particular asset management, asset servicing andconsumer  finance,  have  been  actively  participating  in  European  consolidation  by  signing  or  strengtheningpartnerships  in  France,  Italy  and  Spain.  The  growth  of  our  profitability  is  robust.  It  is  driven  as  much  by  the 
dynamism  of  revenues  as  by  the  improvement  in  operational  efficiency,  without  impeding  investment  in  thedevelopment of our business lines. And it is done by controlling risk-weighted assets and keeping the cost of risklow. Our financial solidity continues to strengthen: the CET1 ratio of Crédit Agricole S.A. reached 12.1%, making 
an initial dismantling of Switch possible in 2020 and securing our distribution policy of 50% in cash. The dividendwas up +1.4% in 2019 to €0.70 per share, demonstrating the performance and the regularity of our distributionpolicy.”Results for the fourth quarter and full year 201911/32Crédit Agricole GroupIn the fourth quarter, underlying net income Group share of Crédit Agricole Group was €1,986 million, up+22.1% compared to fourth quarter 2018.

With regard to the Customer Project, the customer net promoter score at LCL and the RegionalBanks increased (by +8 points and +5 points), innovative offerings were launched (EKO, LCL Essentiel, 
Je suis entrepreneur, Yapla), the digital relationship was enhanced, and 500,000 customers were met aspart  of  Trajectoires  Patrimoine.  Customer  capture  reached  1  800  000  individual  and  entrepreneurcustomers in France and Italy over the year 2019, and net customer capture reached 370 000. With regard 
to the Human-centric Project, the Crédit Agricole Group was ranked first in financial services in Francein terms of diversity by the Financial Times.

Underlying revenues of the Regional Banks increased as well  (+5.7%). Underlying 
operating  expenses  were  up  +1.8%  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2018,  corresponding  to  continued  ITinvestments  under  the  Group’s  Project  and  Medium-Term  Plan.  The  underlying  cost/income  ratio  improvedcompared to fourth quarter 2018 (-2.6 percentage points) to 66.7%.The Group’s underlying revenues reached €33,790 million in 2019, up +3.0% year-on-year, reflecting thestrength of the Universal customer-focused banking model, stable and diversified, and which generatesorganic growth in all the business lines, thanks in particular to revenue synergies between specialised 
business  lines  and  distribution  networks.  Underlying  operating  expenses  excluding  SRF  are  wellcontrolled  (+1.7%  increase  in  2019),  while  incorporating  IT  investments  in  the  Regional  Banks  andinvestments to develop Crédit Agricole S.A.’s business lines, especially in the Asset gathering business 
line.  Positive  jaws  of  1.3  percentage  points  were  recorded  this  year.  Underlying  cost/income  ratioexcluding  SRF  improved  by  -0.8  percentage  point  compared  to  2018,  reaching  63.2%  this  year  andreflecting the Group’s high level of operational efficiency.The cost of risk on outstandings of the Regional Banks was still low (10 basis points, after 14 basis pointsat end-2018). Furthermore, the NPL ratio was down (1.87% vs 2% at end-2018) and the NPL coverage ratioremained  high  (99.1%).  The  Group’s  cost  of  credit  risk  increased  by  +7.1%  in  2019,  as  a  result  of  the 
reversal  of  the  cost  of  risk  in  corporate  and  investment  banking,  but  it  remained  very  low,  and  thecoverage ratio was 82.6%.The  Group’s  Common  Equity  Tier  1  ratio  was  15.9%  at  end-December  2019,  an  increase  of 
+0.4 percentage  point  compared  to  end-September  2019,  more  than  6.2 percentage  points  above  the 
required regulatory level18.The Group's performance can in particular be explained in particular by the implementation of the three pillars of 
its  Group  Project,  which  underpins  its  Raison  d’Etre,  “Working  every  day  in  the  interests  of  customers  andsociety”: the Customer Project, the Human-centric Project and the Societal Project.18   Under the SREP requirement at 9.7% (including countercyclical buffer); €32 billion higher than the threshold for triggering distribution restrictions.Results for the fourth quarter and full year 201912/32Customer ProjectThe Group embarked upon the implementation of its Group Project and MTP launched in June 2019. Concrete 
actions were initiated ton foster excellence in customer relations, which is at the heart of the Customer Project.All Group business lines were organised around customer satisfaction, as evidenced by the net promoter score 
(NPS),  which  has  grown  significantly  since the  end  of  2018:  +8 at  LCL  and  +5  for  the  Regional  Banks  in theindividual customers’ segment. Crédit  Agricole Assurances also ranked No. 1 in automotive and home claims

A plan to address pain-points was alreadylaunched and 25 priority actions have been identified. Lastly, the Group continues to support its customers by 
proposing innovative offerings adapted to their needs. This is illustrated by  “Trajectoires Patrimoine”: this newapproach to providing advice offers a global and dynamic vision of customers’ assets, enabling them to choosethe  best  possible  options  for  developing  and  protecting  them  from  the  very  first  euro.  Since  its  launch  at  thebeginning of 2019, more than 500,000 customers were supported as part of this initiative.The Group continues to adapt its offerings to new uses in order to become a  leading digital bank.

New tailor-made offerings will continue to be rolled out, includingthe Globe-Trotter offering for young people aged 18 to 30 who travel, which has been launched in February 2020. 
The multi-channel relationship also intensified, the  number of customers contacted  within the Regional Bankshas  increased  (+1.9  percentage  points  since  2018),  as  has  the  number  of  customers  using  our  mobileapplications:  +6  percentage  points  for  the  LCL  mobile  application  since  the  end  of  2018,  and  +4  percentage 
points  for  the  “MaBanque”  application.  For  the  third  year  in a row  the LCL mobile application  was  voted bestmobile application by the meilleurebanque.com comparison site, and Crédit Agricole's digital performance wasrewarded in 2019 with the Group's D-rating moving up to BBB under its digital transformation.Innovation is finally placed at the heart of Crédit Agricole's strategy: 547 start-ups currently assisted by Villagesby CA; the network currently consists of 33 Villages By CA in France and Italy, with four new Villages created in2019. La “Fabrique By CA” (the Group's fintech start-up studio) also launched two platforms in 2019, to offer a 
wide range of banking and non-banking services: Je suis entrepreneur for establishing companies, ranging fromthe choice of location to securing business plans, including financing  simulations, and Yapla, dedicated to themanagement of associations.In this context, the Group's customer capture is very dynamic both in France and in Italy, with  1 800 000 new

are individual customers.Human-centric ProjectAs part of the Group's Human Project, the management is being transformed to increase accountability. As ofJanuary 2020, 53% of the managers of Crédit Agricole S.A. were trained in managerial transformation. Circular 
assessments (180°) were set up at CA Italia and Amundi. In order to adopt shorter decision-making chain, toincrease  employee  engagement  and  autonomy  and  to  ensure  greater  customer  proximity,  the  number  ofmanagement layers at Crédit  Agricole Payment  Services  was reduced. “Remote work” agreements were alsorolled out in 80% of the Group's entities by the end of 2019.In order to strengthen social dialogue, an international framework agreement was signed on 31 July, with, as afirst concrete measure, paid maternity leave of 16 weeks for all female employees outside France.

ThisCommittee,  which  brings  together  climate  experts  and  scientists  from  outside  Crédit  Agricole  Group,  isresponsible for  conducting  the  scientific  work  needed  to guide  and  implement  the Group's  climate  strategy.  Itfeeds into the decisions of the Corporate Project Committee.As part of the transition rating implemented this year, Crédit Agricole will request its large corporate customersto provide a detailed plan, by 2021, for the withdrawal of their industrial mining and thermal coal production assets 
within the 2030/2040 timeframe, depending on the location of their assets. As a tool for dialogue and decision-making,  this  transition  rating  complements  the  financial  rating  and  enriches  the  customer  analysis  file.  Theconsolidation  of  the  transition  ratings  will  enable  us  to  identify  more  precisely  the  potential  effects  of  climate 
change on our financing portfolios and to develop climate stress tests for 2050, aligned with different types ofscenarios.Sustainable financeUnifergie – a subsidiary of Crédit Agricole Leasing & Factoring – The “Nord de France” Regional Bank, and CréditAgricole CIB, participated in the refinancing of the French asset portfolio of Boralex, a Canadian company thatdevelops, builds and operates renewable power generation facilities in North America and Europe.

million, and  by  +7.3%  for  the  business lines  excluding  the  Corporate  Centre.  This  growth  was  driven  by  theunderlying revenues of the Large customers business line, up +20.7%/+€244 million, of the Regional Banks, up+5.7%/+€185  million  over  the  period,  and  of  the  Asset  gathering  business  line,  up  +10.4%/+€153  million. 
Underlying revenues in the Specialised financial services business line fell by  -2.6%/- €18 million, but it shouldbe remembered that the results of the automotive partnerships are equity-accounted. International retail bankingposted underlying revenues up +1.3%.Underlying operating expenses were up +2.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, in connection with ITinvestments in the Regional Banks under the  Medium-Term Plan, and investments  in the development of the 
Crédit  Agricole  S.A.  business  lines,  especially  Asset  gathering  and  Large  customers.  The  underlying 
cost/income ratio excluding SRF stood at 64.7%, a clear improvement of 2.7 percentage points comparedto the fourth quarter of 2018. Operating efficiency continues to improve, with a significantly positive jaws effect of+4.4 percentage points.Underlying gross operating income thus increased to €3,035 million compared to fourth quarter 2018 (+15.7%).The cost of credit risk is stable (-1.0%) at -€494 million, versus -€499 million in fourth quarter 2018. This changestems in particular from the Large customers business line, where the cost of credit risk is returning to a normal 
level, with net charges of -€55 million, compared to net reversals of +€26 million that were recorded in the fourth 
quarter of 2018. The cost of risk on outstandings21 of Crédit Agricole Group stood at 20 basis points, up +2 
basis points from fourth quarter 2018, but still at a low level, below the Medium-Term Plan assumption of 25 basispoints.20 Underlying, excluding specific items. See p. 20 and onwards for more details on specific items.  
21 Average loan loss reserves over the last four rolling quarters, annualisedResults for the fourth quarter and full year 201915/32By  incorporating  the  contribution  from  equity-accounted  entities,  which  was  up  by  +7.5%  from  €77  million  to€83 million as a result of the strong performance of the asset management joint ventures (in India in particular), 
the underlying pre-tax income was €2,646 million, up +21.6% compared to fourth quarter 2018.The underlying tax charge was up +27.4% from fourth quarter 2018, showing an increase of +0.9 percentagepoints  in  the  underlying  tax  rate,  from  19.6%  to  20.5%.  Accordingly,  underlying net income  before  non-
controlling interests was up +20.3% and underlying net income Group share was up +22.1% compared to thefourth quarter of 2018.Specific items had a net positive impact of +€200 million on net income Group share this quarter. They 
include the favourable decision of France's Conseil d’Etat on the tax treatment dispute regarding the Emporikisecurities in the amount of +€1,038 million, the costs of integration and acquisition by CACEIS of Santander andKas Bank (respectively -€15 million in operating expenses/-€11 million in net income Group share, and -€6 million 
in net income on other assets/-€5 million in net income Group share), a reclassification of held-for-sale operationsof -€46 million under income from held-for-sale operations. The acquisition of Kas Bank by CACEIS generated abadwill of +€22 million and LCL’s goodwill was partially impaired in the amount of -€664 million. Lastly, recurring 
volatile  accounting  items  such  as  the  DVA  (Debt  Valuation  Adjustment,  i.e.  gains  and  losses  on  financialinstruments related to changes in the Group’s issuer spread), amounting to -€4 million in net income Group share,hedges  onthe  Large customersloan  bookfor-€12 million,  andthe  changesin  provisionsforhome purchase savings plans in the amount of -€119 million are also to be included.In  fourth  quarter  2018,  specific  items  had  a  negative  impact  of  -€55  million  on  net  income  Group  share,including -€14 million from Pioneer Investments integration costs (-€27 before tax and non-controlling interests), 
-€7 million from the integration costs of the three Italian banks (-€11 before tax and non-controlling interests), -€67 million for  the  FCA  Bank  fine,  and,  lastly,  +€33  million  in  net  income Group share  from  recurring  volatileaccounting items, namely the DVA in the amount of +€11 million and the hedges on the Large customers’ loan 
book in the amount of  +€13 million and the changes  in the provision for home purchase savings  plans  in theamount of +€9 million.For  full year  2019,  the  underlying  net  income  Group  share  was  up  (+5.0%/+€342  million)  compared  with 
2018, to €7,191 million. The increase in the cost of credit risk (-€117 million) is attributable to the return of thecost of risk in corporate and investment banking to a normal level. The increase in the tax charge (-€202 million)remained below the strong increase in gross operating income (+€575 million).Underlying revenues were up +3.0% and underlying operating expenses excluding the Single ResolutionFund (SRF) remained under tight control, at  +1.7%.

The momentum in the commercial development of the Regional Banks 
significantly  contributed  to  growth  in  Crédit Agricole S.A.’s  business  lines,  of  which  the  Regional  Banks,  theleading retail banking network in France, are the prime partners in Retail Banking, demonstrating the strength ofthe Group’s Universal customer-focused banking model. Customer’s equipment continues to increase: the stock 
of premium cards for individual customers rose +9% between December 2018 and December 2019, the stock ofproperty and personal insurance policies increased by +4.4%, and outstandings in consumer  credits increasedby +7.3%.Outstanding loans  grew  +6.7%  compared  to  end-December  2018.  This  growth  was  driven  by  home  loans(+7.6%) and business loans (+6%).Customer  assets  rose  +5.9%  year-on-year,  driven  by  on-balance  sheet  deposits  (+6.3%),  notably  demanddeposits  (+11.3%).  Off-balance  sheet  deposits  rose  by  5.2%  year-on-year,  driven  by  life  insurance  assets(+5.3%).The contribution of the Regional Banks to Crédit Agricole Group’s underlying net income Group share cameto €680 million, a sharp increase of +26.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.At €3,413 million, underlying revenues were up (+5.7%) compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. This increaseis explained by a positive market effect on the investment portfolio and by a good level of commissions, offsettingthe pressure on interest revenues.Operating  expenses  were  up  +1.8%  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2018,  mainly  reflecting  the  continued  ITinvestments  under  the  Group’s  Medium-Term  Plan.  The  underlying cost/income ratio  thus  was  66.7%,  adecrease of -2.6 percentage points.Cost of risk recorded a significant decrease in fourth quarter 2019, to -€155 million compared to fourth quarter 
2018 (-37.9%). It represents 10 basis points on outstandings22 (compared to 14 basis points in the fourth quarter 
of 2018), and remains at a low level. Furthermore, the NPL ratio was down to 1.87% (versus 2% at end-2018)and the NPL coverage ratio remained high at 99.1%.22 Relative to consolidated outstandings, calculated on an average annualised basis over four rolling quarters.Results for the fourth quarter and full year 201917/32Over 2019, the contribution of the Regional Banks to underlying net income Group share was €2,597 million,an increase of +8.1%.The  performance of  the  other  Crédit Agricole Group business  lines  is  described  in detail  in the  section of  thispress release on Crédit Agricole S.A.Financial solidityOver  the  quarter,  Crédit Agricole Group  maintained  a  high  level  of  financial  solidity,  with  a  Common  EquityTier 1 (CET1) ratio of 15.9%, up +0.4 percentage point compared to end-September 2019. This ratio providesa substantial buffer of 6.2 percentage points in relation to the  SREP requirement applicable to Crédit AgricoleGroup, set at 9.7% by the ECB (including the countercyclical buffer).The  MREL  ratio  is  estimated  at  33%  of  risk-weighted  assets  at  31  December  2019.  It  stood  at  22.6%without including eligible preferred senior debt, up 120 basis points over the year. The target under theCrédit Agricole Group’s Medium-Term Plan is to achieve a subordinated MREL ratio (excluding eligible senior 
preferred debt) of 24-25%  of risk-weighted assets by  2022. Expressed as a percentage of the institution’stotal liabilities and own funds, after certain prudential restatements (Total Liabilities Own Funds – TLOF), 
the MREL ratio stood at 8.5% at 31 December 2019, excluding eligible senior preferred debt. This is in linewith  the  Medium-Term  Plan  target  of  maintaining  this  ratio  above  8%  of  TLOF,  a  level  which  would  enablerecourse to the Single Resolution Fund, subject to the decision of the Resolution Authority.The TLAC ratio requirements have been applicable since 27 June 2019, when European Regulation CRR2(Capital Requirement Regulation 2) came into force. At 31 December 2019, the Crédit Agricole Group’s TLACratio stood at 22.6% of RWA and 7.6% of leverage risk exposure (LRE), excluding eligible senior preferred 
debt. The TLAC ratio increased by 40 basis points compared to 30 September 2019 due to a stronger CET1 (taxgain in relation to Emporiki) and to the issuance of senior non-preferred Green debt in October. It increased by120 basis points year-on-year. The TLAC ratios for Crédit Agricole Group at 31 December 2019 remain much 
higher  than  the  CRR2/CRDV  requirements23,  by  2.9  percentage  points  for  risk-weighted  assets  and  1.6 
percentage point for LRE, respectively.The phased-in leverage ratio came to 5.7% at end-December 2019.The liquidity position of Crédit Agricole Group is solid. The Group’s banking cash balance sheet, at €1,331 billion 
at 31 December 2019, showed a surplus of stable funding sources over stable assets of €126 billion, up 
€8 billion compared to end-September 2019 and in line with the target under the Medium-Term Plan (over€100 billion). The surplus of stable resources finances the HQLA (High Quality Liquid Assets) securities portfoliogenerated by the LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) requirement for customer or customer-related activities. Thesesecurities (€108 billion) covered more than five times the short-term debt net of Central Bank deposits.The liquidity reserves, which include capital-gains and haircuts on the securities portfolio, stood at €298 billion 
at  31  December  2019.  The  Group’s  average  LCR  ratio  over  12  months  stood  at  128.8%24  at  end-December 
2019, exceeding the Medium-Term Plan target of around 110%.At end-December 2019, the Group’s main issuers raised the equivalent of €38.4 billion in medium-to-long-term debt on the markets, 43% of which was issued by Crédit Agricole S.A. In addition, €3.9 billion was placedin  Crédit  Agricole  Group’s  retail  banking  networks  (Regional  Banks,  LCL  and  CA  Italia)  and  other  externalnetworks, or borrowed from supranational organisations at end-December 2019.***23 With the entry into force of CRR2, the Crédit Agricole Group must meet the following TLAC requirements at all times: 16% of risk-weighted assets,plus the combined buffer requirement according to CRDV (including a 2.5% capital conservation buffer, a 1% systemic buffer and a 0.20% 
countercyclical buffer at 31 December 2019); and 6% of leverage risk exposure.24 The ratio’s numerator and denominator stand at €223.2 billion and €173.3 billion, respectively, for the Crédit Agricole Group.Results for the fourth quarter and full year 201918/32Dominique Lefebvre, Chairman of SAS Rue La Boétie and Chairman of Crédit Agricole S.A.’s Board ofDirectors, commented on the Group’s fourth quarter 2019 and full year 2019 results and business as follows:

The Group's 142,000 employees are committed to serving customers. I am proud of Crédit 
Agricole Group being ranked first in the French financial services sector in terms of diversity by the FinancialTimes, and that we are stepping up our societal commitment, both in terms of inclusive finance, with the issueof €3.7 billion in social bonds by Crédit Agricole CIB, and the growth of nearly 26% in Amundi's social impact 
outstandings, and in terms of green finance, with the definition of an ambitious climate strategy, and this year'sissues of Green bonds and Green covered bonds”.Results for the fourth quarter and full year 201919/32Appendix 1 – Specific items, Crédit Agricole S.A. and
