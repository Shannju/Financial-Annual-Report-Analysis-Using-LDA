告信会师报字[2019]第ZH30014号齐商银行股份有限公司全体股东：一、审计意见我们审计了齐商银行股份有限公司（以下简称齐商银行）财务报表，包括2018年12月31日的合并及母公司资产负债表，2018年度的合并及母公司利润表、合并及母公司现金流量表、合并及母公司股东权益变动表以及相关财务报表附注。我们认为，后附的财务报表在所有重大方面按照企业会计准则的规定编制，公允反映了齐商银行2018年12月31日的合并及母公司财务状况以及2018年度的合并及母公司经营成果和现金流量。二、形成审计意见的基础我们按照中国注册会计师审计准则的规定执行了审计工作。审计报告的“注册会计师对财务报表审计的责任”部分进一步阐述了我们在这些准则下的责任。按照中国注册会计师职业道德守则，我们独立于齐商银行，并履行了职业道德方面的其他责任。我们相信，我们获取的审计证据是充分、适当的，为发表审计意见提供了基础。三、管理层和治理层对财务报表的责任齐商银行管理层（以下简称管理层）负责按照企业会计准则的规定编制财务报表，使其实现公允反映，并设计、执行和维护必要的内部控制，以使财务报表不存在由于舞弊或错误导致的重大错报。在编制财务报表时，管理层负责评估齐商银行的持续经营能力，披露与持续经营相关的事项（如适用），并运用持续经营假设，除非计划进行清算、终止运营或别无其他现实的选择。治理层负责监督齐商银行的财务报告过程。四、注册会计师对财务报表审计的责任我们的目标是对财务报表整体是否不存在由于舞弊或错误导致的重大错报获取合理保证，并出具包含审计意见的审计报告。合理保证是高水平的保证，但并不能保证按照审计准则执行的审计在某一重大错报存在时总能发现。错报可能由于舞弊或错误导致，如果合理预期错报单独或汇总起来可能影响财务报表使用者依据财务报表作出的经济决策，则通常认为错报是重大的。在按照审计准则执行审计工作的过程中，我们运用职业判断，并保持职业怀疑。同时，我们也执行以下工作：(1)  识别和评估由于舞弊或错误导致的财务报表重大错报风险，设计和实施审计程序以应对这些风险，并获取充分、适当的审计证据，作为发表审计意见的基础。由于舞弊可能涉及串通、伪造、故意遗漏、虚假陈述或凌驾于内部控制之上，未能发现由于舞弊导致的重大错报的风险高于未能发现由于错误导致的重大错报的风险。055 齐 商 银 行 二 〇 一 八 年 度 报 告(2)  了解与审计相关的内部控制，以设计恰当的审计程序，但目的并非对内部控制的有效性发表意见。(3) 评价管理层选用会计政策的恰当性和作出会计估计及相关披露的合理性。(4) 对管理层使用持续经营假设的恰当性得出结论。同时，根据获取的审计证据，就可能导致对齐商银行持续经营能力产生重大疑虑的事项或情况是否存在重大不确定性得出结论。如果我们得出结论认为存在重大不确定性，审计准则要求我们在审计报告中提请报表使用者注意财务报表中的相关披露；如果披露不充分，我们应当发表非无保留意见。我们的结论基于截至审计报告日可获得的信息。然而，未来的事项或情况可能导致齐商银行不能持续经营。(5) 评价财务报表的总体列报、结构和内容（包括披露），并评价财务报表是否公允反映相关交易和事项。(6) 就齐商银行中实体或业务活动的财务信息获取充分、适当的审计证据，以对财务报表发表审计意见。我们负责指导、监督和执行集团审计，并对审计意见承担全部责任。我们与治理层就计划的审计范围、时间安排和重大审计发现等事项进行沟通，包括沟通我们在审计中识别出的值得关注的内部控制缺陷。立信会计师事务所（特殊普通合伙）

11,575,746,801.48QISHANG BANK 2018 ANNUAL REPORT066三、财务报表附注一、公司基本情况(一) 公司概况齐商银行股份有限公司（以下简称“本公司”或“齐商银行”）是1997年8月在城市信用合作社基础上成立并在山东省工商局注册的股份制金融企业。本公司原名淄博市商业银行股份有限公司，于2009年2月13日，经中国银监会批准更名为齐商银行股份有限公司。本 公 司 法 定 代 表 人 ： 杲 传 勇 ； 注 册 地 址 ： 淄 博 市 张 店 区 中 心 路 1 0 5 号 ； 金 融 许 可 证 号 ：B0171H237030001号；企业统一社会信用代码：913700001641139094。经营范围主要包括：吸收公众存款；发放短期、中期和长期贷款；办理国内结算；办理票据承兑与贴现；发行金融债券；从事同业拆借；提供担保、代理保险、房屋租赁等；外汇存款；外汇贷款；外汇汇款；外币兑换；国际结算；同业外汇拆借；外汇票据的承兑和贴现；外汇借款；外汇担保；结汇、售汇；资信调查、咨询、鉴证业务。以及其他经中国银行业监督管理委员会依照有关法律、行政法规和其他规定批准的业务。(二) 合并财务报表范围至2018年12月31日，本公司合并财务报表范围内子公司如下：子公司名称临沂河东齐商村镇银行股份有限公司二、财务报表的编制基础(一) 编制基础公司以持续经营为基础，根据实际发生的交易和事项，按照财政部颁布的《企业会计准则——基本准则》和具体会计准则、企业会计准则应用指南、企业会计准则解释及其他相关规定(以下合称“企业会计准则”)编制财务报表。(二) 持续经营公司自本报告期末至少12个月内具备持续经营能力，无影响持续经营能力的重大事项。三、重要会计政策及会计估计(一) 遵循企业会计准则的声明公司所编制的财务报表符合企业会计准则的要求，真实、完整地反映了报告期公司的财务状况、经营成果、现金流量等有关信息。(二) 会计期间067 齐 商 银 行 二 〇 一 八 年 度 报 告自公历1月1日起至12月31日止为一个会计年度。(三) 营业周期本公司营业周期为12个月。(四) 记账本位币本公司采用人民币为记账本位币。(五) 以下注释项目除特别注明之外，金额单位为人民币元。(六) 合并财务报表的编制方法1、合并范围本公司合并财务报表的合并范围以控制为基础确定，所有子公司（包括本公司所控制的单独主体）均纳入合并财务报表。2、合并程序本公司以自身和各子公司的财务报表为基础，根据其他有关资料，编制合并财务报表。本公司编制合并财务报表，将整个企业集团视为一个会计主体，依据相关企业会计准则的确认、计量和列报要求，按照统一的会计政策，反映本公司集团整体财务状况、经营成果和现金流量。所有纳入合并财务报表合并范围的子公司所采用的会计政策、会计期间与本公司一致。(七) 现金及现金等价物在编制现金流量表时，将本公司库存现金以及可以随时用于支付的存款确认为现金。将同时具备期限短（从购买日起三个月内到期）、流动性强、易于转换为已知现金、价值变动风险很小四个条件的投资，确定为现金等价物。包括存放中央银行款项（扣除法定存款准备金）、存放同业款项、拆出资金、买入返售金融资产。(八) 外币业务和外币报表折算1、外币业务外币业务采用交易发生日的即期汇率作为折算汇率将外币金额折合成人民币记账。资产负债表日外币货币性项目余额按资产负债表日即期汇率折算，由此产生的汇兑差额，除属于与购建符合资本化条件的资产相关的外币专门借款产生的汇兑差额按照借款费用资本化的原则处理外，均计入当期损益。2、外币财务报表的折算资产负债表中的资产和负债项目，采用资产负债表日的即期汇率折算；所有者权益项目除“未分配利润”项目外，其他项目采用发生时的即期汇率折算。利润表中的收入和费用项目，采用交易发生日的即期汇率折算。(九) 买入返售金融资产和卖出回购金融资产款QISHANG BANK 2018 ANNUAL REPORT068买入返售是指按合同或协议规定，以一定的价格向交易对手买入相关资产（包括债券、票据及贷款等），到合同规定日期，再以规定价格返售给对方的合同。买入返售金融资产按买入相关资产时实际支付的金额入账。卖出回购是指按合同或协议规定，以一定的价格将相关资产（包括债券、票据及贷款等）出售给交易对手，到合同规定日期，再以规定价格回购的合同。卖出回购金融资产款按卖出相关资产时实际收到的金额入账。(十) 长期股权投资1、共同控制、重大影响的判断标准共同控制，是指按照相关约定对某项安排所共有的控制，并且该安排的相关活动必须经过分享控制权的参与方一致同意后才能决策。本公司与其他合营方一同对被投资单位实施共同控制且对被投资单位净资产享有权利的，被投资单位为本公司的合营企业。重大影响，是指对一个企业的财务和经营决策有参与决策的权力，但并不能够控制或者与其他方一起共同控制这些政策的制定。本能够对被投资单位施加重大影响的，被投资单位为本公司联营企业。2、初始投资成本的确定(1) 企业合并形成的长期股权投资同一控制下的企业合并：公司以支付现金、转让非现金资产或承担债务方式以及以发行权益性证券作为合并对价的，在合并日按照取得被合并方所有者权益在最终控制方合并财务报表中的账面价值的份额作为长期股权投资的初始投资成本。(2) 其他方式取得的长期股权投资以支付现金方式取得的长期股权投资，按照实际支付的购买价款作为初始投资成本。以发行权益性证券取得的长期股权投资，按照发行权益性证券的公允价值作为初始投资成本。3、后续计量及损益确认方法(1) 成本法核算的长期股权投资公司对子公司的长期股权投资，采用成本法核算。除取得投资时实际支付的价款或对价中包含的已宣告但尚未发放的现金股利或利润外，公司按照享有被投资单位宣告发放的现金股利或利润确认当期投资收益。(2) 权益法核算的长期股权投资对联营企业和合营企业的长期股权投资，采用权益法核算。初始投资成本大于投资时应享有被投资单位可辨认净资产公允价值份额的差额，不调整长期股权投资的初始投资成本；初始投资成本小于投资时应享有被投资单位可辨认净资产公允价值份额的差额，计入当期损益。(十一) 固定资产1、固定资产确认条件固定资产指为生产商品、提供劳务、出租或经营管理而持有，并且使用寿命超过一个会计年度的有形069 齐 商 银 行 二 〇 一 八 年 度 报 告资产。固定资产在同时满足下列条件时予以确认：(1) 与该固定资产有关的经济利益很可能流入企业；(2) 该固定资产的成本能够可靠地计量。2、各类固定资产的折旧方法固定资产折旧采用年限平均法分类计提，根据固定资产类别、预计使用寿命和预计净残值率确定折旧率。如固定资产各组成部分的使用寿命不同或者以不同方式为企业提供经济利益，则选择不同折旧率或折旧方法，分别计提折旧。融资租赁方式租入的固定资产，能合理确定租赁期届满时将会取得租赁资产所有权的，在租赁资产尚可使用年限内计提折旧；无法合理确定租赁期届满时能够取得租赁资产所有权的，在租赁期与租赁资产尚可使用年限两者中较短的期间内计提折旧。主要固定资产类别的折旧年限如下：资产类别                                                                                                                                         折旧年限房屋及建筑物电子设备机器设备运输工具及其他(十二) 在建工程30年3年5年5年在建工程项目按建造该项资产达到预定可使用状态前所发生的必要支出，作为固定资产的入账价值。所建造的固定资产在建工程已达到预定可使用状态，但尚未办理竣工决算的，自达到预定可使用状态之日起，根据工程预算、造价或者工程实际成本等，按估计的价值转入固定资产，并按本公司固定资产折旧政策计提固定资产的折旧，待办理竣工决算后，再按实际成本调整原来的暂估价值，但不调整原已计提的折旧额。(十三) 无形资产1、无形资产的计价方法(1) 公司取得无形资产时按成本进行初始计量；(2) 后续计量在取得无形资产时分析判断其使用寿命。对于使用寿命有限的无形资产，在为企业带来经济利益的期限内按直线法摊销；无法预见无形资产为企业带来经济利益期限的，视为使用寿命不确定的无形资产，不予摊销。2、无形资产的使用寿命估计情况每期末，对无形资产的使用寿命及摊销方法进行复核。QISHANG BANK 2018 ANNUAL REPORT0703、无形资产减值准备的计提对于使用寿命确定的无形资产，如有明显减值迹象的，期末进行减值测试。对于使用寿命不确定的无形资产，每期末进行减值测试。对无形资产进行减值测试，估计其可收回金额。无形资产的减值损失一经确认，在以后会计期间不再转回。(十四) 长期资产减值长期股权投资、采用成本模式计量的投资性房地产、固定资产、在建工程、无形资产等长期资产，于资产负债表日存在减值迹象的，进行减值测试。减值测试结果表明资产的可收回金额低于其账面价值的，按其差额计提减值准备并计入减值损失。可收回金额为资产的公允价值减去处置费用后的净额与资产预计未来现金流量的现值两者之间的较高者。资产减值准备按单项资产为基础计算并确认，如果难以对单项资产的可收回金额进行估计的，以该资产所属的资产组确定资产组的可收回金额。资产组是能够独立产生现金流入的最小资产组合。(十五) 其他资产1、长期待摊费用长期待摊费用是指已经支出但应由本期和以后各期负担的分摊期限在一年以上（不含一年）的各项费用。2、抵债资产抵债资产按取得时的公允价值入帐，公允价值与相关资产账面价值及支付的税费之间的差额计入当期损益。抵债资产处置时，如果取得的处置收入大于抵债资产账面价值，其差额计入营业外收入；如果取得的处置收入小于抵债资产账面价值，其差额计入营业外支出；保管过程中发生的费用直接计入其他业务支出。处置过程中发生的费用，从处置收入中抵减。3、其他应收款项本公司按照其他应收款的项目和对方单位（个人）进行明细核算。本公司定期分析各项其他应收款项的可收回性，当应收款项的可收回金额低于其账面价值时，计提资产减值准备，并计入当期损益。(十六) 职工薪酬1、短期薪酬的会计处理方法本公司在职工为本公司提供服务的会计期间，将实际发生的短期薪酬确认为负债，并计入当期损益或相关资产成本。本公司为职工缴纳的社会保险费和住房公积金，以及按规定提取的工会经费和职工教育经费，在职工为本公司提供服务的会计期间，根据规定的计提基础和计提比例计算确定相应的职工薪酬金额。071 齐 商 银 行 二 〇 一 八 年 度 报 告职工福利费为非货币性福利的，如能够可靠计量的，按照公允价值计量。2、离职后福利的会计处理方法(1) 设定提存计划本公司按当地政府的相关规定为职工缴纳基本养老保险和失业保险，在职工为本公司提供服务的会计期间，按以当地规定的缴纳基数和比例计算应缴纳金额，确认为负债，并计入当期损益或相关资产成本。除基本养老保险外，本公司还依据国家企业年金制度的相关政策建立了企业年金计划。本公司按职工工资总额的一定比例向年金计划缴费，相应支出计入当期损益或相关资产成本。(2) 设定受益计划本公司根据预期累计福利单位法确定的公式将设定受益计划产生的福利义务归属于职工提供服务的期间，并计入当期损益或相关资产成本。3、辞退福利的会计处理方法本公司在不能单方面撤回因解除劳动关系计划或裁减建议所提供的辞退福利时，或确认与涉及支付辞退福利的重组相关的成本或费用时（两者孰早），确认辞退福利产生的职工薪酬负债，并计入当期损益。(十七) 收入确认收入在相关的经济利益很可能流入本公司且金额能够可靠计量，同时满足以下不同类型收入的其他确认条件时，予以确认。1、利息收入金融资产的利息收入根据让渡资金使用权的时间和实际利率在计入当期损益。利息收入包括折价或溢价的摊销，当实际利率与合同利率差异不大时，采用合同利率。当一项金融资产或一组类似的金融资产确认减值损失后，确认利息收入所使用的利率为计量减值损失时对未来现金流进行贴现时使用的利率。2、手续费和佣金收入手续费和佣金收入在提供相关服务时，根据权责发生制的原则确认。资产买卖、或参与第三方进行资产买卖交易（如购买客户贷款、证券，或出售业务）时产生的手续费于相关交易完成时确认。3、股利收入非上市权益工具投资的股利收入于本公司收取股利权力时确认计入当期损益，计入投资收益。(十八) 递延所得税资产和递延所得税负债对于可抵扣暂时性差异确认递延所得税资产，以未来期间很可能取得的用来抵扣可抵扣暂时性差异的应纳税所得额为限。对于能够结转以后年度的可抵扣亏损和税款抵减，以很可能获得用来抵扣可抵扣亏损和税款抵减的未来应纳税所得额为限，确认相应的递延所得税资产。QISHANG BANK 2018 ANNUAL REPORT072对于应纳税暂时性差异，除特殊情况外，确认递延所得税负债。不确认递延所得税资产或递延所得税负债的特殊情况包括：商誉的初始确认；除企业合并以外的发生时既不影响会计利润也不影响应纳税所得额（或可抵扣亏损）的其他交易或事项。当拥有以净额结算的法定权利，且意图以净额结算或取得资产、清偿负债同时进行时，当期所得税资产及当期所得税负债以抵销后的净额列报。当拥有以净额结算当期所得税资产及当期所得税负债的法定权利，且递延所得税资产及递延所得税负债是与同一税收征管部门对同一纳税主体征收的所得税相关或者是对不同的纳税主体相关，但在未来每一具有重要性的递延所得税资产及负债转回的期间内，涉及的纳税主体意图以净额结算当期所得税资产和负债或是同时取得资产、清偿负债时，递延所得税资产及递延所得税负债以抵销后的净额列报。(十九) 委托业务本公司通常作为受托人在受托业务中为信托机构、其他机构和零售客户管理资产。受托业务中所涉及的资产不属于本公司，因此不包括在本公司财务报表中。委托贷款是指本公司接受委托，由客户（作为委托人）提供资金，由本公司（作为受托人）按照委托人确定的贷款对象、用途、金额、期限、利率而代理发放和监督使用并由本公司协助收回的贷款，风险由委托人承担。本公司进行委托贷款业务只收取手续费，不代垫资金，不承担信用风险。(二十) 债务重组债务重组，是指在债务人发生财务困难的情况下，本公司作为债权人按照其与债务人达成的协议或者法院的裁定作出让步的事项。债务重组的方式主要包括：（一）以资产清偿债务；（二）将债务转为资本；（三）修改其他债务条件；（四）以上三种方式的组合等。以现金清偿债务的，本公司将重组债权的账面余额与收到的现金之间的差额，计入当期损益。本公司已对债权计提减值准备的，先将该差额冲减减值准备，减值准备不足以冲减的部分，计入当期损益。以非现金资产清偿债务的，本公司对受让的非现金资产按其公允价值入账，重组债权的账面余额与受让的非现金资产的公允价值之间的差额，比照以现金清偿债务的规定处理。将债务转为资本的，本公司将享有股份的公允价值确认为对债务人的投资，重组债权的账面余额与股份的公允价值之间的差额，比照以现金清偿债务的规定处理。修改其他债务条件的，本公司将修改其他债务条件后的债权的公允价值作为重组后债权的账面价值，重组债权的账面余额与重组后债权的账面价值之间的差额，比照以现金清偿债务的规定处理。修改后的债务条款中涉及或有应收金额的，本公司不确认或有应收金额，不将其计入重组后债权的账面价值。债务重组采用以现金清偿债务、非现金资产清偿债务、债务转为资本、修改其他债务条件等方式的组合进行的，本公司依次以收到的现金、接受的非现金资产公允价值、债权人享有股份的公允价值冲减重组债权的账面余额，再按照修改其他债务条件的规定处理。073

Financial Accounting ReportI.  Audit ReportTo all the shareholders of QISHANG BANK CO., LTD.:Audit ReportX.K.S.B.Z. [2019] No. ZH30014I. Audit Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of QISHANG BANK CO., LTD. (hereinafter referred to as “QISHANG BANK”), including consolidated balance sheet and 
parent company’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2018, consolidated income statement and parent company’s income statement of 2018, consolidated cash flow 
statement and parent company’s cash flow statement, consolidated statement of change in owner’s equity and parent company’s statement of change in owner’s 
equity as well as notes to relevant financial statements.In our opinion, the attached financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Accounting Criteria for Enterprises in all material respects, and have 
given a true and fair view of consolidated financial position and parent company’s financial position of QISHANG BANK as of December 31, 2018and its consolidated 
operational performance and cash flow and parent company’s operational performance and cash flow of 2018.II. Basis Forming Audit Opinion
We have conducted audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing for Certified Public Accountants, The section of "CPA's Responsibility in Auditing Financial 
Statements" included in the Audit Report further elaborates our responsibility under these standards. In accordance with Chinese Code of Professional Ethics for 
Certified Public Accountants, we are independent of Qishang Bank and have fulfilled other responsibilities in terms of professional ethics. We believe that the audit 
evidences we have obtained are sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.III. Responsibility of the Management and Governance to Financial Statements
The management of QISHANG BANK (hereinafter referred to as the management) is responsible for preparing financial statements in accordance with the 
provisions of Accounting Criteria for Enterprises so as to realize fair presentation, as well as designing, implementing and maintaining necessary internal control to 
avoid material misstatement of financial statements due to fraud or error.In the preparation of these financial statements, the management is responsible for assessing Qishang Bank's ability for continuing operation, disclosing the 
matters related to continuing operation (if applicable), and using the continuing operation assumptions, except where it is planned to carry out liquidation or 
terminate operations, or there is no other realistic option.The governance layer is responsible for supervising the financial reporting process of Qishang Bank.IV. CPA's Responsibility in Auditing Financial Statements
Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether these financial statements, as a whole, do not contain any material misstatement due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an audit report containing our audit opinions. Reasonable assurance is at a high level, but it does not guarantee that the audits conducted in 
accordance with the audit standards can always find any major misstatement as long as it exists. Misstatement is possibly caused by fraud or error. If misstatement, 
alone or together, is reasonably expected to possibly affect the economic decisions made by the financial statement users on the basis of these financial statements, 
the misstatement is often deemed to be material.In the process of auditing these financial statements according to the auditing standards, we used our professional judgment and maintained professionalsuspicion. At the same time, we also carried out the following work:(1) identifying and evaluating material misstatement risks of these financial statements caused due to fraud or error, designing and implementing the audit 
procedures in response to these risks, and obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence which serves as the basis to express our audit opinions. Because fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omission, false statement or override the internal control, the risk of failing to find material misstatement due to fraud is 
higher than that of material misstatement due to error.(2) understanding the internal control related to audit so as to design appropriate audit procedures, but our purpose is not to comment on the effectiveness of109 齐 商 银 行 二 〇 一 八 年 度 报 告internal control.(3) evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies adopted by the management and the rationality of making accounting estimates and relevantdisclosure.(4) drawing a conclusion on the appropriateness of the continuing operation assumptions used by the management. At the same time, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, we drew a conclusion on whether there is significant uncertainty in matters or situations that may cause significant doubts about the continuing 
operation capacity of Qishang Bank. If we come to the conclusion that there is a significant uncertainty, we are required by the auditing standards to draw attention 
of the financial statement users to relevant disclosure in the financial statements in the audit reports. If the disclosure is insufficient, we shall make a non-unqualified 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the information available as of the audit report date. However, future events or situations may cause Qishang Bank to be unable 
to continue operating.(5) evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of these financial statements (including disclosure), and also whether the financial statements fairlyreflect the relevant transactions and events.(6) obtaining sufficient and appropriate audit evidence on the financial information of the corporate or business activities in Qishang Bank to issue our auditopinions on the financial statements. We are responsible for guiding, supervising and executing the group audit and assume full responsibility for the audit opinions.We communicated with the governance layer on the planned audit coverage, scheduling, and major audit findings, including the internal control defects that weidentified in the audit and deserve attention.Chinese Certified Public Accountant of BDO (Special general partnership)Certified Public Accountant of China:Shanghai, China SaturdayCertified Public Accountant of China:April 10, 2019QISHANG BANK 2018 ANNUAL REPORT110II.
