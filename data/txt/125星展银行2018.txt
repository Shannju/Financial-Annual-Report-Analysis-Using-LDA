Opinion 
 
What we have audited 
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of DBS Bank (China) Limited (hereinafter 
“DBS Bank”), which comprise:the balance sheet as at 31 December 2018;   
the income statement for the year then ended; 
the cash flow statement for the year then ended; 
the statement of changes in owners’ equity for the year then ended; and 
 
 
 
  notes to the financial statements.Our opinion 
 
In  our  opinion,  the  accompanying  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the 
financial position of DBS Bank as at 31 December 2018, and its financial performance and cash flows 
for the year then ended in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards for Business 
Enterprises (“CASs”).Basis for Opinion  
 
We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  China  Standards  on  Auditing  (“CSAs”).  Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
  
We are independent of DBS Bank in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants 
of  the  Chinese  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants  (“CICPA  Code”),  and  we  have  fulfilled  our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the CICPA Code.PwC ZT [2019] Shen Zi (2019) No. 22451 
 (Page 2 of 3)Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial 
Statements  
 
Management of DBS Bank is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial 
statements in accordance with the CASs, and for such internal control as management determines is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
 
In preparing these financial statements, management is responsible for assessing DBS Bank’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intend to liquidate DBS Bank or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
Those  charged  with  governance  are  responsible  for  overseeing  DBS  Bank’s  financial  reporting 
process. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  
 
Our  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  these  financial  statements  as  a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report  that  includes  our  opinion.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a 
guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  CSAs  will  always  detect  a  material 
misstatement  when  it  exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered 
material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
 
As part of an audit in accordance with CSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:Identify and assess the risks of material  misstatement of the financial statements, whether 
due to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and 
obtain  audit evidence that  is sufficient  and  appropriate to  provide  a basis  for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control.  Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  ofaccounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.- 2 -PwC ZT [2019] Shen Zi (2019) No. 22451 
 (Page 3 of 3)Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (Cont’d)  Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of  management’s  use  of  the  going  concern  basis  of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  DBS  Bank’s  ability  to 
continue  as  a  going  concern.  If  we  conclude  that  a  material  uncertainty  exists,  we  are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in these financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause DBS Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.  Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the  financial  statements, 
including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  financial  statements  represent  the  underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.

[English translation for reference only]GENERAL INFORMATION 
 
DBS Bank (China) Limited (the “Bank”) was established as a wholly-owned subsidiary of DBS 
Bank Ltd. (“DBS Bank”) in Shanghai, China. 
 
Prior  to  the  establishment  of  the  Bank  and  the  transfer  of  business  (the  “conversion”),  DBS 
Bank had three branches (Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou) and DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd. 
(“DBS  HK”)  had  two  branches  (Shenzhen  and  Suzhou)  in  the  People’s  Republic  of  China 
(“PRC”)  (collectively  known  as  the  “Former  Branches”).  On  22  December  2006,  the  Bank 
obtained  an  approval  from  the  China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission  (“CBRC”)  to  be 
incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of DBS Bank by consolidating the two branches of 
DBS  Bank  (Beijing  and  Guangzhou)  and  two  branches  of  DBS  HK  (Shenzhen  and  Suzhou). 
The Shanghai Branch of DBS Bank was permitted to maintain its branch status to carry on its 
foreign  currency  business  (the  “Retained  Branch”).  The  Retained  Branch  was  closed  on  30 
December 2015.  
 
The Bank obtained its finance approval license No.00000042 from the CBRC and obtained its 
business  license  (Shi  Ju)  Qi  Du  Hu  Zong  Zi  No.044272  from  the  Shanghai’s  State 
Administration of Industry and Commerce on 22 May 2007 and 24 May 2007, respectively. The 
initial registered/paid-up capital of the Bank was RMB 4 billion. Pursuant to the approval from 
CBRC on 21 August 2012(Yin Jian Fu(2012)No.429), the Bank increased its registered paid-up 
capital  to  RMB  6.3  billion.  The  Bank  obtained  a  new  business  license  No.1116082  from  the 
Shanghai’s State Administration of Industry and Commerce on 24 September 2012. Pursuant 
to  the  approval  from  CBRC  on  9  September  2016  (Hu  Yin  Jian  Fu(2016)No.382),  the  Bank 
increased its registered paid-up capital to RMB 8.0 billion. The Bank obtained a new business 
license No.00000002201609290009 from the Shanghai’s State Administration of Industry and 
Commerce on 29 September 2016. 
 
The Bank’s operating period is non-restricted according to its business license. It is principally 
engaged in the provision of foreign currency and Renminbi banking businesses as approved by 
the related regulators. 
 
DBS  Bank  (China)  Limited  Shanghai  Pilot  Free  Trade  Zone  Sub-branch  obtained  its  finance 
approval license from CBRC, Shanghai Bureau (HYJBZ[2014] No.3) and obtained its business 
license  No.310000500539013  from  the  Shanghai’s  State  Administration  of  Industry  and 
Commerce  on  3  January  2014  and  6  January  2014  respectively.  Currently,  the  Bank  has 
twelve  branches  and  twenty  three  sub-branches  located  in  Shanghai,  Beijing,  Shenzhen, 
Suzhou, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Nanning, Dongguan, Hangzhou, Chongqing, Qingdao and Xi’an 
of the PRC.BASIS OF PREPARATIONThe  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Accounting  Standard  for 
Business  Enterprises  -  Basic  Standard,  and  other  accounting  standards  and  relevant 
regulations  issued  by the  Ministry of Finance  of  the PRC(“MOF”) on 15 February  2006 and in 
subsequent periods (hereafter collectively referred to as “the Accounting Standard for Business 
Enterprises” or “CAS”).

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 
(All amounts expressed in RMB unless otherwise stated) 
[English translation for reference only]STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR BUSINESS 
ENTERPRISES 
 
The financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2018 are in compliance 
with the Accounting  Standards for Business  Enterprises, and truly and  completely present the 
financial position of the Bank as of 31 December 2018 and of the financial performance, cash 
flows and other information for the year then ended.CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
In addition to the following revisions, the accounting policies adopted by the Bank in preparing 
this financial statements are consistent with those adopted in prior year. 
 
The  MoF  issued  revised  CAS  14  (Revenue)  on  5  July  2017.  The  Bank  chose  to  early  adopt 
revised  CAS  14  from  1  January  2018.  This  revision  unifies  the  current  income  criterion  and 
construction  contract  criterion  into  one  income  recognition  model.  Simultaneously  it  takes 
control  transferring  as  the  income-recognition  judgment  standard  instead  of  risk  transferring, 
and clarifies  specific applications.  The adoption  of revised  CAS  14  has no material  impact on 
the Bank’s financial position, operating performance or cash flow. 
 
The  MoF  issued  revised  CAS  22  (Recognition  and  Measurement  of  Financial  Instruments), 
CAS  23  (Transfer  of  Financial  Assets),  CAS  24  (Hedging)  and  CAS  37  (Presentation  of 
Financial Instruments) (“New CASs of financial instruments”) in 2017. The Bank chose to early 
adopt  above  accounting  standards  from  1  January  2018.  As  permitted  by  the  transitional 
provisions  of  new  accounting  standards,  the  Bank  elected  not  to  restate  comparative  figures. 
Any  adjustments  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of 
transition were adjusted to the opening undistributed profits and other comprehensive income. 
 
On  26  December  2018,  the  MoF  issued  the  Circular  on  revising  and  issuing  the  Formats  of 
Financial Statements of Financial Enterprises for 2018 (the “Circular"). Companies which have 
implemented new CASs of financial instruments and revised revenue standard are required to 
present  the  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  this  Circular.  Format  in  CAS  Application 
Guide issued by the MoF on 13 October 2006 will no longer be effective. As the Bank adopted 
New  CASs  of  financial  instruments  and  revised  CAS  14  from  1  January  2018,  the  Bank  has 
presented its financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 in accordance with the 
Circular. 
 
Set  out  below  are  disclosures  relating  to  the  impact  from  the  adoption  of  new  accounting 
standards on the Bank. Further details of the specific accounting policies applied in the current 
period (as well as the previous CAS 22 and CAS 23 (“previous CASs of financial instruments) 
applied in the comparative period) are described in note 5 below.10DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
Accounting period 
 
The Bank’s accounting period starts on 1 January and ends on 31 December. 
 
Functional currency 
 
The  Bank’s  financial  statements  are  presented  in  Renminbi  (“RMB”),  which  is  its  functional 
currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operates.Foreign currency translation 
 
Transactions in foreign currencies are measured using the spot exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction. 
 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into RMB at the 
spot  exchange  rate  as  at  the  balance  sheet  date.  Foreign  exchange  differences  arising  from 
this translation are recognised in the income statement.  
 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at cost in a foreign currency are translated using 
the  spot exchange rate at the date  of the transaction. Contributions to paid-in capital made in 
foreign  currencies  are  translated  into  the  RMB  denominated  paid-in  capital  account  at  the 
stipulated exchange rate at the contribution date.Cash and cash equivalents 
 
For  the  purposes  of  the  cash  flow  statement,  cash  and  cash  equivalents  comprise  assets 
balances with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition including: 
cash  on  hand,  non-restricted  balances  with  central  banks,  deposits  with  other  banks  and 
placements with financial institutions.13DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

EPRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES(continued) 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities (New CASs of financial instruments) 
 
Initial recognition and measurement 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the  instrument. Regular way purchases and  sales of financial assets 
are  recognised  on  trade-date,  the  date  on  which  the  Bank  commits  to  purchase  or  sell  the 
asset. 
 
At  initial  recognition,  the  Bank  measures  a  financial  asset  or  financial  liability  at  its  fair  value 
plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit 
or loss, transaction costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the acquisition or issue 
of the financial asset or financial  liability, such as fees and commissions. Transaction costs of 
financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in 
profit  or  loss.  Immediately  after  initial  recognition,  an  expected  credit  loss  allowance  (ECL)  is 
recognised for financial assets measured at amortised cost and investments in debt instruments 
measured at FVOCI, which results in an accounting loss being recognised in profit or loss when 
an asset is newly originated. 
 
When the fair value of financial assets and liabilities differs from the transaction price on initial 
recognition, the entity recognises the difference as follows: 
 
(a). When the fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset 
or liability (i.e. a Level 1 input) or based on a valuation technique that uses only data from 
observable markets, the difference is recognised as a gain or loss.(b). In  all other  cases, the  difference  is deferred  and  the timing  of recognition  of deferred day 
one  profit  or  loss  is  determined  individually.  It  is  either  amortised  over  the  life  of  the 
instrument,  deferred  until  the  instrument’s  fair  value  can  be  determined  using  market 
observable inputs, or realised through settlement.Measurement methods 
 
Amortised cost and effective interest rate 
 
The amortised cost is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at 
initial  recognition  minus  the  principal  repayments,  plus  or  minus  the  cumulative  amortisation 
using  the  effective  interest  method  of  any  difference  between  that  initial  amount  and  the 
maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance.145

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES(continued) 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities (New CASs of financial instruments) (continued) 
 
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or 
receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying 
amount of a financial asset (i.e. its amortised cost before any impairment allowance) or to the 
amortised cost of a financial liability. The calculation does not consider expected credit losses 
and includes transaction costs, premiums or discounts and fees and points paid or received that 
are integral to the effective interest rate, such as origination fees. For purchased or originated 
credit-impaired (‘POCI’) financial assets – assets that are credit-impaired at initial recognition – 
the Bank calculates the credit-adjusted effective interest rate, which is calculated based on the 
amortised cost of the financial asset instead of its gross carrying amount and incorporates the  
impact of expected credit losses in estimated future cash flows. 
 
When the Bank revises the estimates of future cash flows, the carrying amount of the respective 
financial assets or financial liability is adjusted to reflect the new estimate discounted using the 
original effective interest rate. Any changes are recognised in profit or loss. 
 
Interest income 
 
Interest  income  is  calculated  by  applying  the  effective  interest  rate  to  the  carrying  amount  of 
financial assets, except for: 
 
(a). POCI financial assets, for which the original credit-adjusted effective interest rate is appliedto the amortised cost of the financial asset.(b).  Financial  assets  that  are  not  ‘POCI’  but  have  subsequently  become  credit-impaired  (or 
‘stage 3’), for which interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to their 
amortised cost (i.e. net of the expected credit loss provision). 
 
Financial assets 
 
(i) Classification and subsequent measurement 
 
From 1 January 2018, the Bank has applied new CASs of financial instruments and classifies 
its financial assets in the following measurement categories: 
 
  Fair value through profit or loss (FVPL); 
  Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI); or 
  Amortised cost.155

Financial assets and financial liabilities (New CASs of financial instruments) (continued) 
 
Financial assets(continued) 
 
The classification requirements for debt and equity instruments are described below: 
 
Debt instruments 
 
Debt instruments  are those instruments  that meet the definition  of  a  financial  liability from  the 
issuer’s  perspective,  such  as  loans,  government  and  corporate  bonds  and  trade  receivables 
purchased from clients in factoring arrangements without recourse. 
 
Classification and subsequent measurement of debt instruments depend on: 
 
(i) The Bank’s business model for managing the asset; and 
 
(ii) The cash flow characteristics of the asset. 
 
Based on these factors, the Bank classifies its debt instruments into one of the following three 
measurement categories: 
 
Amortised cost:  Assets that are held for collection  of contractual cash flows where those cash 
flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (‘SPPI’), and that are not designated at 
FVPL, are measured at amortised cost. The carrying amount of these assets is adjusted by any 
expected  credit  loss  allowance  recognised  and  measured  from  these  financial  assets  is 
included in ‘Interest income’ using the effective interest rate method. 
 
Fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  (FVOCI):  Financial  assets  that  are  held  for 
collection  of  contractual  cash  flows  and  for  selling  the  assets,  where  the  assets’  cash  flows 
represent  solely  payments  of principal and  interest, and  that  are  not  designated at FVPL,  are 
measured  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  (FVOCI).  Movements  in  the 
carrying  amount  are  taken  through  OCI,  except  for  the  recognition  of  impairment  gains  or 
losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses on the instrument’s amortised 
cost  which  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss.  When  the  financial  asset  is  derecognised,  the 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss 
and  recognised  in  ‘Net  gains  arising  from  investment’.  Interest  income  from  these  financial 
assets is included in ‘Interest income’ using the effective interest rate method. 
 
Fair  value  through  profit  or  loss:  Assets  that  do  not  meet  the  criteria  for  amortised  cost  or 
FVOCI are  measured at  fair value  through  profit  or  loss.  A  gain  or  loss on  a  debt  investment 
that  is subsequently  measured at  fair value  through profit or loss and is  not part of a hedging 
relationship  is  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  and  presented  in  the  profit  or  loss  statement  within 
'Net  gains  arising  from  trading  activities'  in  the  period  in  which  it  arises.  Interest  income  from 
these financial assets is included in 'Net gains arising from trading activities' using the effective 
interest rate method.165

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES(continued) 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities (New CASs of financial instruments) (continued) 
 
Financial assets(continued) 
 
Business  model:  the  business  model  reflects  how  the  Bank  manages  the  assets  in  order  to 
generate  cash  flows.  That  is,  whether  the  Bank’s  objective  is  solely  to  collect  the  contractual 
cash flows from the assets or is to collect both the contractual cash flows and cash flows arising 
from the sale of assets. If neither of these is applicable (e.g. financial assets are held for trading 
purposes),  then  the  financial  assets  are  classified  as  part  of  ‘other’  business  model  and 
measured  at  FVPL.  Factors  considered  by  the  Bank  in  determining  the  business  model  for  a 
group of assets include past experience on how the cash flows for these assets were collected, 
how  the  asset’s  performance  is  evaluated  and  reported  to  key  management  personnel,  how 
risks are assessed and managed and how managers are compensated. For example, the Bank 
manages  its mortgage loans  as  to hold and collect  the contractual cash flows.  Only when the 
Bank issues asset-based  securities can these loans  been  sold to SPVs which are included in 
the  scope  of  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  transaction  does  not  lead  to  the 
derecognition  of  financial  assets  within  the  Bank.  For  another  example,  the  Bank  holds 
portfolios  for  liquidity  management,  the  business  model  of  which  includes  both  collection  of 
contractual cash flows and sale of assets. 
 
SPPI: Where the business model is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows or to collect 
contractual  cash  flows  and  sell,  the  Bank  assesses  whether  the  financial  instruments’  cash 
flows  represent  solely  payments  of  principal  and  interest  (the  ‘SPPI  test’).  In  making  this 
assessment, the Bank considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic 
lending arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit 
risk,  other  basic  lending  risks  and  a  profit  margin  that  is  consistent  with  a  basic  lending 
arrangement.  Where  the  contractual  terms  introduce  exposure  to  risk  or  volatility  that  are 
inconsistent  with  a  basic  lending  arrangement,  the  related  financial  asset  is  classified  and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
Financial  assets  with embedded  derivatives  are considered in  their  entirety when  determining 
whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest. 
 
The Bank reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing 
those assets changes. The reclassification takes place from the start of the first reporting period 
following  the  change.  Such  changes  are  expected  to  be  very  infrequent  and  none  occurred 
during the period. 
 
Equity instruments 
 
Equity  instruments  are  instruments  that  meet  the  definition  of  equity  from  the  issuer’s 
perspective;  that  is,  instruments  that  do  not  contain  a  contractual  obligation  to  pay  and  that 
evidence a residual interest in the issuer’s  net assets. Examples of equity instruments  include 
basic ordinary shares.175

(ii) Impairment 
 
The  Bank  assesses  on  a  forward-looking  basis  the  expected  credit  losses  (‘ECL’)  associated 
with  its  debt  instrument  assets  carried  at  amortised  cost  and  FVOCI  and  with  the  exposure 
arising from loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The Bank recognises a loss 
allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects: 
 
•  An  unbiased  and  probability-weighted  amount  that  is  determined  by  evaluating  a  range  ofpossible outcomes;• The time value of money; and 
 
• Reasonable  and  supportable  information that is  available without  undue  cost  or effort  at  the 
reporting  date  about  past  events,  current  conditions  and  forecasts  of  future  economic 
conditions.(iii) Modification of loans 
 
The Bank sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of loans to 
customers.  When  this  happens,  the  Bank  assesses  whether  or  not  the  new  terms  are 
substantially different to the original terms. The Bank does this by considering, among others, 
the following factors: 
 
• If the borrower is in financial difficulty, whether the modification merely reduces the contractualcash flows to amounts the borrower is expected to be able to pay.• Whether any substantial new terms are introduced, such as a profit share/equity-based returnthat substantially affects the risk profile of the loan.• Significant extension of the loan term when the borrower is not in financial difficulty. 
 
• Significant change in the interest rate. 
 
• Change in the currency the loan is denominated in. 
 
• Insertion of collateral, other security or credit enhancements that significantly affect the creditrisk associated with the loan.If  the  terms  are  substantially  different,  the  Bank  derecognises  the  original  financial  asset  and 
recognises  a  ‘new’  asset  at  fair  value  and  recalculates  a  new  effective  interest  rate  for  the 
asset. The date of renegotiation is consequently considered to be the date of initial recognition 
for  impairment  calculation  purposes,  including  for  the  purpose  of  determining  whether  a 
significant increase in credit risk has occurred. However, the Bank also assesses whether the 
new financial asset recognised is deemed to be credit-impaired at initial recognition, especially 
in  circumstances where  the renegotiation  was driven by  the  debtor  being  unable to  make  the 
originally agreed payments. Differences in the carrying amount are also recognised in profit or 
loss as a gain or loss on derecognition.185

If  the  terms  are  not  substantially  different,  the  renegotiation  or  modification  does  not  result  in 
derecognition, and the Bank recalculates the gross carrying amount based on the revised cash 
flows of the financial asset and recognises a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. The new 
gross  carrying  amount  is  recalculated  by  discounting  the  modified  cash  flows  at  the  original 
effective  interest  rate  (or  credit-adjusted  effective  interest  rate  for  purchased  or  originated 
credit-impaired financial assets). 
 
(iv) Derecognition other than on a modification 
 
Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive 
the cash flows from the assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and either (i) 
the Bank transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or (ii) the Bank neither 
transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and the Bank has not 
retained control.  
 
The Bank enters  into transactions  where  it retains the contractual rights to  receive  cash flows 
from assets but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to other entities and 
transfers  substantially  all  of  the  risks  and  rewards.  These  transactions  are  accounted  for  as 
‘pass through’ transfers that result in derecognition if the Bank: 
 
(i) Has no obligation to make payments unless it collects equivalent amounts from the assets; 
 
(ii) Is prohibited from selling or pledging the assets; and 
 
(iii) Has an obligation to remit any cash it collects from the assets without material delay. 
 
Collateral  (shares  and  bonds)  furnished  by  the  Bank  under  standard  repurchase  agreements 
and  securities  lending  and  borrowing  transactions  are  not  derecognised  because  the  Bank 
retains  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  on  the  basis  of  the  predetermined  repurchase 
price,  and  the  criteria  for  derecognition  are  therefore  not  met.  This  also  applies  to  certain 
securitisation transactions in which the Bank retains a subordinated residual interest. 
 
When  the  contractual  rights  to  receive  the  cash flows  from  the  assets have been  transferred, 
and the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, 
and  the  Bank  has  retained  control  of  the  transferred  assets,  the  Bank  applies  continuing 
involvement  approach.  Under  this  approach,  the  Bank  continues  to  recognise  the  transferred 
asset to the extent of its continuing involvement and recognise the associated liability, to reflect 
the  rights  and  obligations  retained  by  the  Bank.  The  net  carrying  amount  of  the  transferred 
asset and associated liability is: (a) the amortised cost of the rights and obligations retained by 
the Bank, if the transferred asset is measured at amortised cost; or (b) equal to the fair value of 
the rights and  obligations retained  by the Bank when measured on  a stand-alone basis, if the 
transferred asset is measured at fair value.195

Financial assets and financial liabilities (New CASs of financial instruments) (continued) 
 
Financial liabilities 
 
(i) Classification and subsequent measurement 
 
In both the current and prior period, financial liabilities are  classified as liabilities measured at 
amortised cost, except for: 
 
•  Financial  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss:  this  classification  is  applied  to 
derivatives, financial liabilities held for trading (e.g.  short positions in the trading booking) and 
other  financial  liabilities  designated  as  such  at  initial  recognition.  Gains  or  losses  on  financial 
liabilities  designated  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  presented  partially  in  other 
comprehensive  income  (the  amount  of  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  financial  liability  that  is 
attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability, which is determined as the amount that 
is  not  attributable  to  changes  in  market  conditions  that  give  rise  to  market  risk)  and  partially 
profit  or  loss  (the  remaining  amount  of  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  liability).  This  is  unless 
such a presentation would create, or enlarge, an accounting mismatch, in which case the gains 
and losses attributable to changes in the credit risk of the liability are also presented in profit or 
loss; 
 
•  Financial  liabilities  arising  from  the  transfer  of  financial  assets  which  did  not  qualify  for 
derecognition  or  when  the  continuing  involvement  approach  applies.  When  the  transfer  of 
financial  asset  did  not  qualify  for  derecognition,  a  financial  liability  is  recognised  for  the 
consideration received for the transfer. 
 
(ii) Derecognition 
 
Financial  liabilities  are  derecognised  when  they  are  extinguished  (i.e.  when  the  obligation 
specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires).  
 
The exchange between the Bank and its original lenders of debt instruments with substantially 
different  terms,  as well as  substantial  modifications of the  terms of existing financial  liabilities, 
are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a 
new financial liability. The terms are substantially different if the discounted present value of the 
cash  flows  under  the  new  terms,  including  any  fees  paid  net  of  any  fees  received  and 
discounted  using  the  original  effective  interest  rate,  is  more  than  10%  different  from  the 
discounted  present  value  of  the  remaining  cash  flows  of  the  original  financial  liability.  In 
addition, other qualitative factors,  such as  the  currency  that the  instrument is denominated in, 
changes  in  the  type  of  interest  rate,  new  conversion  features  attached  to  the  instrument  and 
change  in  covenants  are  also  taken  into  consideration.  If  an  exchange  of  debt  instruments  or 
modification  of  terms  is  accounted  for  as  an  extinguishment,  any  costs  or  fees  incurred  are 
recognised as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment. If the exchange or modification is 
not accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount 
of the liability and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified liability.205

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES(continued) 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities (Previous CASs of financial instruments)  
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
 
This category includes: financial assets and financial liabilities held for trading, derivatives and 
those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception. 
 
A financial asset or a financial liability is classified as held for trading if it is acquired or incurred 
principally for the purpose of selling, repurchasing or redemption in the near term or if it is part 
of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is 
evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Derivatives (including derivatives 
embedded  in  other  contracts  but  separated  for  accounting  purposes)  are  also  categorised  as 
held for trading unless they are designated as hedges in accordance with (Note 5 (G)).  
 
Financial assets or financial liabilities except for hybrid instruments are designated at fair value 
through profit or loss when: 
 
  Doing  so  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  measurement  or  recognition  inconsistenciesthat would otherwise arise;  Certain financial assets or financial liabilities portfolios that are managed and evaluated on 
a  fair  value  basis  in  accordance  with  a  documented  risk  management  or  investment 
strategy and reported to key management personnel on that basis.Financial  assets  or  financial  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  measured  at  fair 
value at the initial recognition and subsequent balance sheet dates, and changes in fair value 
and the transaction costs are reported in income statement.Loans and receivables 
 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments 
that are not quoted in an active market, including deposits with the central bank, deposits with 
other  banks,  placements  with  financial  institutions,  financial  assets  purchased  under  resale 
agreements, loans and advances and investment securities classified as loans and receivables. 
When the Bank provides funds or services directly to customers and does not intend to sell the 
receivables, the Bank classifies such financial assets as loans and receivables and recognises 
them  at  fair  value  plus  transaction  costs  at  initial  recognition.  At  subsequent  balance  sheet 
dates,  such  assets  are  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  effective  interest  method  less  any 
impairment allowances.Available-for-sale financial assets 
 
Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are those that are either designated as such or 
are not classified in any of the other categories. The Bank also holds such financial assets for 
the purpose of investment  or satisfying regulatory liquidity requirements. They are intended to 
be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or 
changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices. Financial assets in this category are 
held  in  certain  business  segments  as  well  as  the  liquidity  management  unit.  Such  financial 
assets are recognized at fair value plus related transaction costs at time of acquisition, and are 
subsequently measured at fair value at balance sheet dates. Unrealized gains or losses arising 
from changes in fair value of financial assets classified as available-for-sale financial assets are 
recognized in other comprehensive  income  and accumulated directly in  equity  after deducting 
tax  impact.  When  sold  or  impaired,  the  accumulated  fair  value  adjustments  previously 
recognized in equity are reclassified to the income statement.21DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  (Previous  CASs  of  financial  instruments) 
(continued) 
 
Other financial liabilities 
 
Other financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value, being their issuance proceeds net 
of  transaction  costs  incurred.  They  are  subsequently  stated  at  amortized  cost  and  any 
difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognized in 
the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
 
De-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities 
 
Financial assets are derecognized when: (1) the rights to receive cash flows from the financial 
assets  have  expired;  (2)  the  financial  assets  are  transferred  and  the  Bank  has  transferred 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership; (3) the Bank does not transfer or retain nearly 
all the risks and rewards relating to the ownership of the financial asset, but the Bank waives its 
control  over  the  financial  assets.  When  financial  assets  are  derecognized,  the  difference 
between carrying  amount  and  accumulated amount  of  fair  value  that was directly  booked into  
equity  (refer  to  transfer  available-for-sale  financial  assets)  was  booked  into  profit  or  loss. 
Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are extinguished - that is, when the obligation is 
discharged, cancelled or expires. When derecognized, the difference between carrying amount 
and received amount was booked into profit or loss. 
 
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities 
 
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between 
knowledgeable,  willing  parties  in  an  arm's  length  transaction.  The  fair  values  of  quoted 
investments  in  active  markets  are  based  on  current  bid  prices.  A  financial  instrument  is 
regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from 
an  exchange,  dealer,  broker,  industry  group,  pricing  service  or  regulatory  agency,  and  those 
prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. If 
the market for a financial asset is not active, the Bank establishes fair value by using valuation 
techniques.

(i) Assets carried at amortised cost 
 
The Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is evidence that a financial asset 
or  a  group  of  financial  assets  is  impaired.  A  financial  asset  or  a  group  of  financial  assets  is 
impaired  and  impairment  losses  are  incurred  if,  and  only  if,  there  is  objective  evidence  of 
impairment  as  a  result  of  one  or  more  events  that  occurred  after  the  initial  recognition  of  the 
asset  and  that  loss  event  has  an  impact  on  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  of  the  financial 
asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. The criteria that the Bank uses 
to determine whether there is evidence of an impairment loss include:  Significant  financial  difficulty  of  the  issuer  or  obligor  ,  including  breach  of  covenantsand/or financial conditions;  a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments;22DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

reorganisation;thatthe  borrower  will  enter  bankruptcy  or  otherfinancialthe disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial  
difficulties of the issuer;  observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated       futurecash flows from a group of financial assets since the initial recognition of those assets, 
although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the 
Bank.The  Bank  first  assesses  whether  objective  evidence  of  impairment  exists  individually  for 
financial  assets  that  are  individually  significant,  and  individually  or  collectively  for  financial 
assets that are not individually significant. If the Bank determines that no objective evidence of 
impairment  exists  for  an  individually  assessed  financial  asset,  whether  significant  or  not,  it 
includes  the  asset  in  a  group  of  financial  assets  with  similar  credit  risk  characteristics  and 
collectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment 
and  for  which  an  impairment  loss  is  or  continues  to  be  recognized  are  not  included  in  a 
collective assessment of impairment. 
 
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and 
the  present  value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows  (excluding  future  credit  losses  that  have  not 
been  incurred)  discounted  at  the  financial  asset’s  original  effective  interest  rate.  The  carrying 
amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the 
loss is recognized in income statement. In practice, the Bank will also determine the fair value 
of the financial assets with the observed market value and  assessed the impairment loss with 
that fair value. 
 
The  calculation  of  the  present  value  of  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  of  a  collateralized 
financial asset reflects the cash flows that may result from foreclosure less costs for obtaining 
and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable.For the purposes of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped on the 
basis of similar and relevant credit risk characteristics. Those characteristics are relevant to the 
estimation  of  future  cash  flows  for  groups  of  such  assets  by  being  indicative  of  the  debtors’ 
ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated. 
 
Future  cash  flows  in a  group  of financial assets  that  are collectively  evaluated for impairment 
are estimated on the basis of the contractual cash flows of the assets in the Bank and historical 
loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the Bank. Historical 
loss  experience  is  adjusted  on  the  basis  of  current  observable  data  to  reflect  the  effects  of 
current conditions that did not affect the period on which the historical loss experience is based 
and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not exist currently.235

Impairment of financial assets (continued) 
 
(i) Assets carried at amortised cost (continued) 
 
The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly 
by the Bank to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. 
 
When a loan is uncollectible, it is written off against the related allowance for loan impairment. 
Such loans are written off after all the recovery procedures have been exhausted and the 
amount of the loss has been determined. Recoveries in full or in part of amounts previously 
written off are credited to the amount of the impairment losses for loans and advances in the 
income statement. 
 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can 
be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized (such as an 
improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the previously recognized impairment loss is 
reversed by adjusting the allowance account. The amount of the reversal is recognized in the 
income statement. 
 
(ii) Assets classified as available-for-sale 
 
The  Bank  assesses  at  each  balance  sheet  date  whether  there  is  objective  evidence  that  a 
financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of investments classified 
as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its 
cost is considered in determining whether the assets are impaired.  
 
If  any  such  evidence  exists  for  available-for-sale  financial  assets,  the  cumulative  loss, 
measured  as  the  difference  between  the  acquisition  cost  and  the  current  fair  value,  less  any 
impairment  loss  on  that  financial  asset  previously  recognized  in  the  income  statement,  is 
removed from owner’s equity and recognized in the income statement. 
 
If,  in  a  subsequent  period,  the  fair  value  of  a  debt  instrument  classified  as  available-for-sale 
increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment 
loss  was  recognized  in  the  income  statement,  the  impairment  loss  is  reversed  through  the 
income statement.  
 
Impairment losses recognized in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed 
through the income statement. But impairment losses on equity instruments that are not quoted 
in  an  active  market  and  are  not  reliably  estimated  with  fair  value,  or  impairment  losses  on 
derivative assets set off by delivering equity instruments cannot be reversed.245

Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments 
 
Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments 
to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments 
when  due,  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  a  debt  instrument.  Such  financial  guarantees  are 
given  to  banks,  financial  institutions  and  others  on  behalf  of  customers  to  secure  loans, 
overdrafts and other banking facilities. 
 
Financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at 
the higher of: 
 
• The amount of the loss allowance (calculated as described in Note 5.E); and 
 
•  The  premium  received  on  initial  recognition  less  income  recognised  in  accordance  with  the 
principles of CAS 14. 
 
Loan  commitments  provided  by  the  Bank  are  measured  as  the  amount  of  the  loss  allowance 
(calculated as described in Note 5.E). The Bank has not provided any commitment to provide 
loans  at  a  below-market  interest  rate,  or  that  can  be  settled  net  in  cash  or  by  delivering  or 
issuing another financial instrument. 
 
For loan  commitments and financial guarantee  contracts, the  loss  allowance  is  recognised  as 
ECL allowance with new CASs of financial instruments. 
 
The contractual amounts of loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts are disclosed 
as off-balance sheet items in Note 53. 
 
Derivative instruments and hedge accounting 
 
The  Bank  has  elected  to  apply  the  hedge  accounting  requirements  of  new  CASs  of  financial 
instruments. 
 
The  Bank  has  not  provided  comparative  information  for  periods  before  the  date  of  initial 
application  of  new  CASs  of  financial  instruments  for  the  new  disclosures  introduced  by  new 
CASs of financial instruments  as a consequential amendment to new CAS 37, as permitted by 
new CAS 37 paragraph 104. 
 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is 
entered  into  and  are  subsequently  remeasured  at  fair  value.  All  derivatives  are  carried  as 
assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative. 
 
Certain  derivatives  are  embedded  in  hybrid  contracts,  such  as  the  conversion  option  in  a 
convertible bond. If the hybrid contract contains a host that is a financial asset, then the Bank 
assesses the entire contract as described in the financial assets section above for classification 
and  measurement  purposes.  Otherwise,  the  embedded  derivatives  are  treated  as  separate 
derivatives when: 
 
(i) Their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract; 
 
(ii) A separate instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a derivative; and 
 
(iii) The hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
These  embedded  derivatives  are  separately  accounted  for  at  fair  value,  with  changes  in  fair 
value  recognised  in  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss  unless  the  Bank  chooses  to  designate  the 
hybrid contracts at fair value through profit or loss.255

Derivative instruments and hedge accounting (continued) 
 
The  method  of  recognising  the  resulting  fair  value  gain  or  loss  depends  on  whether  the 
derivative is designated and qualifies as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item 
being hedged. The Bank designates certain derivatives as either: 
 
(a) Hedges of  the  fair  value of recognised assets  or  liabilities  or  firm commitments  (fair  value 
hedges); or 
 
(b)  Hedges  of  highly  probable  future  cash  flows  attributable  to  a  recognised  asset  or  liability 
(cash flow hedges). 
 
The Bank documents, at the inception of the hedge, the relationship between hedged items and 
hedging  instruments,  as  well  as  its  risk  management  objective  and  strategy  for  undertaking 
various hedge transactions. The Bank also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception 
and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are 
highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. 
 
Fair value hedge 
 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are 
recorded in the statement of profit or loss, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged 
asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. 
 
If the hedge  no  longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the  carrying 
amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or 
loss over the period to maturity and recorded as net interest income. 
 
Cash flow hedge 
 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify 
as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to 
the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.Amounts  accumulated  in  equity  are  recycled  to  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss  in  the  periods 
when the hedged item affects profit or loss. They are recorded in the income or expense lines in 
which the revenue or expense associated with the related hedged item is reported. 
 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for 
hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity 
and is recognised in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a forecast 
transaction  is  no  longer  expected  to  occur  (for  example,  the  recognised  hedged  asset  is 
disposed of), the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
is immediately reclassified to the statement of profit or loss.265

Fixed assets 
 
Fixed assets comprise office  equipment and furniture and computers. Fixed assets purchased 
or constructed by the Bank are initially recorded at cost. 
 
Subsequent costs  are  included in the  asset’s  carrying amount,  as appropriate,  only when it is 
probable  that  future  economic  benefits  associated  with  the  item  will  flow  to  the  Bank  and  the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably. However, the carrying amount of any parts of fixed 
assets  that  are  being  replaced  shall  be  derecognised  and  all  related  subsequent  costs  are 
expensed when incurred.   
 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the cost of such assets 
to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. For impaired fixed assets, depreciation 
is calculated based on carrying amounts after deducting the provision for impairment over their 
estimated remaining useful lives.   
 
Estimated useful lives, estimated residual value and annual depreciation rates are as follows:Estimated useful lives  Estimated residual value 
 
 
0%5-8 yearsDepreciation rate 
 
 
12.5%-20%Office equipmentand furniture 
Computers andother electronic  
 equipment2-5 years0%20%-50%The  Bank reviews  the  estimated  residual  value, useful  lives  and depreciation  method  of fixed 
assets and makes appropriate adjustments on an annual basis.   
 
When the Bank disposes or ceases to use the fixed assets, or does not expect to further benefit 
from fixed assets, the Bank derecognises the assets. Proceeds from sale, transfer or disposal 
of fixed assets are recorded in the income statement after deducting carrying value and related 
taxes. 
 
Long-term prepaid expenses 
 
Long-term  prepaid  expenses  include  leasehold  improvement  and  other  expenses  that  have

Impairment of non-financial assets 
 
Fixed assets or other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment if there are indications of 
impairment.  If  the  carrying  value  of  such  assets  is  higher  than  the  recoverable  amount,  the 
excess  is  recognized  as  an  impairment  loss.    The  recoverable  amount  is  the  higher  of  the 
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
 
Provision  for  impairment is  determined  on  individual  basis.  If  it  is not  possible to  estimate  the 
recoverable amount of the individual asset, the Bank determines the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating  unit  to  which  the  asset  belongs  (the  asset’s  cash-generating  unit).    A  cash-
generating  unit  is  the  smallest  group  of  assets  that  includes  the  asset  and  generates  cash 
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.  
 
Once  an  impairment  loss  is  recognised,  it  shall  not  be  reversed  to  the  extent  of  recovery  in 
value in subsequent periods.Interest income and expenses 
 
Interest income and expense for all interest-bearing financial instruments are recognised within 
‘interest  income’  and  ‘interest  expense’  in  the  income  statement  using  the  effective  interest 
method. 
 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset 
or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant 
period using its effective interest rate. 
 
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or 
receipts  through  the  expected  life  of  the  financial  instrument  or,  when  appropriate,  a  shorter 
period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. 
 
When  calculating  the  effective  interest  rate,  the  Bank  estimates  cash  flows  considering  all 
contractual terms of the financial instrument (e.g., prepayment options, call options and similar 
options) but does not consider future credit losses.The  calculation  includes  all  fees  paid  or  received  between  parties  to  the  contract  that  are  an 
integral  part of the effective interest  rate,  such as transaction costs and all other premiums  or 
discounts.  If the cash flows  cannot be estimated, the Bank shall use contractual cash flows  in 
the entire contract period. 
 
Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of 
an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the 
future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. 
 
Fee and commission income/expense 
 
Fee  and  commission  incomes  are  generally  recognized  on  the  percentage  of  completion 
method  when  the  related  service  has  been  provided.  Fees  and  commission  expenses  are 
generally recognized on an accrual basis when the related service has been received.5

Fee and commission income/expense(continued) 
 
Under revised CAS 14, revenue is recognised when a performance obligation is satisfied, which 
could either be at a point in time or when the obligation is satisfied over time. Revised CAS 14 
applies mainly to “fee and commission income” within the Bank. 
 
Fee  and  commission  income  are  recognised  when  the  Bank  has  satisfied  its  performance 
obligation in providing the promised products and services to the customer, and are recognised 
based on contractual rates agreed with customers, net of expected waivers based on historical 
experience,  and  net  of  expenses  directly  related  to  it.  The  Bank  generally  satisfies  its 
performance obligation and recognises the fee and commission income on the following basis: 
 
  Transaction-based  fee  and  commission  income  is  recognised  on  the  completion  of  the 
transaction.  Such  fees  include  underwriting  fees,  brokerage  fees,  bancassurance  sales 
commission  and  variable  service  fees,  and  fees  related  to  the  completion  of  corporate 
finance transactions.  For  a  service  that  is  provided  over  a  period  of  time,  fee  and  commission  income  is 
recognised  on  equal  proportion  basis  over  the  period  during  which  the  related  service  is 
provided  or  credit  risk  is  undertaken.  This  basis  of  recognition  most  appropriately  reflects 
the nature and pattern of provision of these  services to the  customers over time. Fees for 
these services can be billed  to  customers  in advance or periodically over time.  Such fees 
include the income from issuance of financial guarantees and bancassurance fixed service 
fees.The Bank does not provide any significant credit terms to customers for the above products and 
services. 
 
Directly  related  expenses  typically  include  brokerage  fees  paid,  card-related  expenses  and 
sales commissions, but do not include expenses for services delivered over a period (such as 
service  contracts) and  other  expenses that  are  not  specifically related  to fee  and  commission 
income transactions.295

Deferred income taxes 
 
Deferred  income  tax  is  provided  in  full,  using  the  liability  method,  on  temporary  differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial 
statements. Deferred tax assets shall be recognised for deductible losses or tax credits that can 
be carried forward to  subsequent  years. The deferred  tax assets and  deferred  tax liabilities at 
the balance sheet date shall be measured the tax rates that, according to the requirements of 
tax laws, are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.Deferred tax assets shall be recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit 
will be available against which the deductible losses and tax credits can be utilised. 
 
Deferred income tax related to fair value re-measurement of available-for-sale investments is 
credited or charged directly to equity and is subsequently recognised in the income statement 
together with the deferred gain and loss. 
 
The  Bank’s  deferred  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  netted  as  the  amounts  are 
recoverable from or due to the same tax authority. 
 
Operating leases 
 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the 
leaser  are  classified  as  operating  leases.The  Bank  entered  into  various  operating  lease 
agreements to rent its branches’ offices and facilities. Payments made under operating leases 
are expensed on a straight-line basis over the period of the leases. 
 
When  an  operating  lease  is  terminated  before  the  lease  period  has  expired,  any  payment 
required to be made to the lesser by way of penalty is recognized as an expense in the period 
in which termination takes place.Contingent liabilities and acceptances 
 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence 
will  only  be  confirmed  by  the  occurrence  or  non-occurrence  of  one  or  more  uncertain  future 
events not wholly within the control of the Bank. It can also be a present obligation arising from 
past  events  that  is  not  recognized  because  it  is  not  probable  that  an  outflow  of  economic 
resources will be required or the amount of obligation cannot be measured reliably. 
 
A  contingent  liability  is  not  recognized  as  a  provision  but  is  disclosed  in  the  notes  to  the 
financial  statements. When  a change  in the  probability  of an  outflow occurs  so  that  outflow  is 
probable, it will then be recognized as a provision. 
 
Acceptances comprise undertakings by the Bank to pay bills of exchange drawn on customers. 
The Bank expects most acceptances to be settled simultaneously with the reimbursement from 
the  customers.  Acceptances  are  accounted  for  as  off-balance  sheet  transactions  and  are 
disclosed as contingent liabilities and commitments.30DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

Employee benefits 
 
Employee  benefits  mainly  include  short-term employee  salary,  post-employment benefits, and 
share plan incurred in exchange for service rendered by employees or various forms of rewards 
or compensation due to severance of labour relation. 
 
Short-term employee benefits 
 
Short-term employee benefits include wages or salaries, bonus, allowances and subsidies, staff 
welfare,  medical  insurance,  work  injury  insurance,  maternity  insurance,  housing  funds,  union 
running costs and employee education costs, short-term paid absences. The employee benefits 
are  recognised  in  the  accounting  period  in  which  the  service  has  been  rendered  by  the 
employees,  and  as  costs  of  assets  or  expenses  to  whichever  the  employee  service  is 
attributable.  Employee  benefits  which  are  non-monetary  benefits  shall  be  measured  at  fair 
value. 
 
Post-employment benefits 
 
The  Bank  classifies  post-employment  benefit  plans  as  either  defined  contribution  plans  or 
defined  benefit  plans.  Defined  contribution  plans  are  post-employment  benefit  plans  under 
which the Bank pays fixed contributions into a separate fund and will have no obligation to pay 
further  contributions;  and  Defined  benefit  plans  are  post-employment  benefit  plans  other  than 
defined  contribution  plans.  During  the  reporting  period,  the  Bank  's  post-employment  benefits 
mainly  include  basic  pensions  and  unemployment  insurance,  both  of  which  belong  to  the 
defined contribution plans. 
 
The  Bank’s  employees  participate  in  the  defined  basic  pension  insurance  plan  set  up  and 
administered by local labour and social protection authorities.  Basic pensions are provided for 
monthly  according  to  stipulated  bases  and  proportions  to  local  labour  and  social  security 
institutions. When employees retire, local labour and social security institutions have a duty to 
pay  the  basic  pension  insurance  to  them.  The  amounts  payable  are  recognised  as  liabilities 
based on the above provisions in the accounting period in which the service has been rendered 
by  the  employees,  and  as  costs  of  assets  or  expenses  to  whichever  the  employee  service  is 
attributable. 
 
Share Based Payment 
 
The employees of the Bank enjoy the equity-settled stock incentive plan implemented by the 
DBS Group Holding Ltd. (“DBS Group”), under which the Bank provides shares issued by DBS 
Group to all the employees for exchange of services they provided. Such shares provided are 
recognized in the Bank’s income statement according to the fair value of the equity instruments 
at the grant date and amortized over the vesting period with a corresponding adjustment to the 
payable to head office account.5 
 
P(1)(2)(3)315QSegment Reporting 
 
The Bank identifies operating segments based on the internal organization structure, management 
requirement and internal reporting, and then disclose segment information of reportable segment 
which is based on operating segment. 
 
An  operating segment is a component  of the Bank :  (a) that engages  in business activities from 
which  it  may  earn  revenues  and  incur  expenses  (including  revenues  and  expenses  relating  to 
transactions);  (b)  whose  operating  results  are  regularly  reviewed  by  the  Bank’s  senior 
management  to  make  decisions  about  resources  to  be  allocated  to  the  segment  and  assess  its 
performance, and (c) for  which discrete financial  information,  including  the  financial position,  the 
financial  performance  and  cash  flows,  is  available.  Two  or  more  operating  segments  may  be 
aggregated into a single operating segment if the segments have similar economic characteristics, 
and fulfil certain criteria.  
 
The majority of the Bank’s business activities are conducted within Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, 
Shenzhen, Suzhou, Chongqing, Tianjin and Nanning of the PRC.  
 
Business combinationsR 
 
(1)  Business combinations involving enterprises not under common control.The  cost  of  combination  and  identifiable  net  assets  obtained  by  the  acquirer  in  a  business 
combination are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Where the cost of the combination 
exceeds  the  acquirer’s  interest  in  the  fair  value  of  the  acquiree’s  identifiable  net  assets,  the 
difference  is  recognized  as  goodwill;  where  the  cost  of  combination  is  lower  than  the  acquirer’s 
interest  in  the  fair  value  of  the  acquiree’s  identifiable  net  assets,  the  difference  is  recognized  in 
profit  or  loss  for the  current  period. Costs  directly attributable to the  combination are  included  in 
profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Transaction costs associated with the issue 
of  equity  or  debt  securities  for  the  business  combination  are  included  in  the  initially  recognized 
amounts of the equity or debt securities.DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

S  Government GrantsGovernment grants refer to the monetary or non-monetary assets obtained by the Bank from the 
government, including tax return, financial subsidy and etc. 
 
Government  grants  are  recognised  when  the  grants  can  be  received  and  the  Bank  can  comply 
with all attached conditions. If a government grant is a monetary asset, it will be measured at the 
amount received or receivable. If a government grant is a non-monetary asset, it will be measured 
at  its  fair  value.  If  it  is  unable  to  obtain  its  fair  value  reliably,  it  will  be  measured  at  its  nominal 
amount. 
 
Government grants related to assets refer to government grants which are obtained by the Bank 
for  the  purposes  of  purchase,  construction  or  acquisition  of  the  long-term  assets.  Government 
grants related to income refer to the government grants other than those related to assets. 
 
Government  grants  related  to  assets  are  either  deducted  against  the  carrying  amount  of  the 
assets, or recorded as deferred income and recognised in profit or loss on a systemic basis over 
the  useful  lives of  the  assets.  Government  grants related  to income that  compensate  the  future 
costs,  expenses  or  losses  are  recorded  as  deferred  income  and  recognised  in  profit  or  loss,  or 
deducted against related costs, expenses or losses in reporting the related expenses; government 
grants related to income that compensate the incurred costs, expenses or losses are recognised 
in profit or loss, or deducted against related costs, expenses or losses directly in current period. 
The  Bank  applies  the  presentation  method  consistently  to  the  similar  government  grants  in  the 
financial statements. 
 
Government  grants  that  are  related  to  ordinary  activities  are  included  in  operating  profit, 
otherwise, they are recorded in non-operating income or expenses. 
 
For  the  policy  loans  with  favourable  interest  rates,  the  Bank  records  the  loans  at  the  actual 
amounts  and  calculates  the  interests  by  loan  principals  and  the  favourable  interest  rates.  The 
interest  subsidies  directly  received  from  government  are  recorded  as  a  reduction  of  interest 
expenses.33DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

[English translation for reference only]6ABCCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES 
 
The  Bank  makes  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and 
liabilities in the financial statements.  Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are 
based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are 
believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  Areas  susceptible  to  changes  in  essential 
estimates  and  judgments,  which  affect  the  carrying  value  of  assets  and  liabilities,  are  set  out 
below.  It  is  impracticable  to  determine  the  effect  of  changes  to  either  the  key  assumptions 
discussed  below  or  other  estimation  uncertainties.  It  is  possible  that  actual  results  may  require 
material adjustments to the estimates referred to below. 
 
Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance 
 
The  measurement  of  the  expected  credit  loss  allowance  for  financial  assets  measured  at 
amortised  cost  and  FVOCI  is  an  area  that  requires  the  use  of  complex  models  and  significant 
assumptions  about  future  economic  conditions  and  credit  behavior  (e.g.  the  likelihood  of 
customers defaulting and the resulting losses).  
 
A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for 
measuring ECL, such as: 
 
  Determining criteria for significant increase in credit risk; 
  Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL; 
  Establishing the number and relative weightings of forward-looking scenarios for each type ofproduct/market and the associated ECL; and  Establishing groups of similar financial assets for the purpose of measuring ECL.Fair value of financial instruments 
 
The fair value of financial instruments that is not quoted in active markets is determined by using 
valuation  techniques.  The  valuation  models  (like  cash  flow  discount  model)  are  periodically 
evaluated and validated by the specialists with professional qualifications, who are independent of 
the designers of the models. To the extent practical, cash flow models use only observable data, 
however,  areas  such  as  credit  risk  (both  own  and  counterparty),  volatilities  and  correlations 
require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect 
reported fair value of financial instruments. 
 
Income tax 
 
Significant  estimates are required in  determining the  provision for income tax.  There  are certain 
transactions  and  calculations  for  which  the  ultimate  tax  determination  is  uncertain  during  the 
ordinary course of business. The Bank recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based 
on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. In particular, the deductibility of certain items 
in the  PRC is subject to tax authority’s  approval, mainly like the impairment  allowance  for loans 
and  advances. Where  the  final  tax  outcome  of  these  matters  is  different  from  the  amounts  that 
were  initially  recorded,  such  differences  will  impact  the  income  tax  and  deferred  income  tax 
provisions in the period in which such determination is made.7  AUTHORIZATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe financial statements were authorized for issue by Board of Directors on February 14, 2019 .3489DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

fixed rate for floating rate) or a combination of all these (i.e. cross-currency interest rate swaps).  
The  Bank’s  credit  risk  represents  the  potential  cost  to  replace  the  swap  contracts  if 
counterparties  fail  to  perform  their  obligation.  This  risk  is  monitored  on  an  ongoing  basis  with 
reference  to  the current fair value, the notional amount  of the contracts  and  the liquidity  of the 
market.  To  control  the  level  of  credit  risk  taken,  the  Bank  assesses  counterparties  using  the 
same techniques as for its lending activities. 
 
Foreign currency options are  contractual agreements  under which the  seller (writer) grants the 
purchaser  (holder)  the  right,  but  not  the  obligation,  either  to  buy  (a  call  option)  or  sell  (a  put 
option) at or  by  a set date or during a  set period, a  specific amount  of a foreign currency  or a 
financial instrument at a predetermined price. The seller receives a premium from the purchaser 
in consideration for the assumption of foreign exchange risk. Options may be either exchange-
traded or negotiated between the Bank and a customer (OTC). 
 
Interest rate options is a right obtained by the buyer, after payment of a premium, to buy or sell 
certain  interest  rate  instrument  at  certain  interest  rate  (price)  within  its  validity  period  or  after 
expiration.   
 
Equity  options  provide  the  buyer,  on  payment  of  a  premium,  the  right  but  not  the  obligation, 
either  to  purchase  or  sell  a  specified  stock  or  stock  index  at  a  specified  price  or  level  on  or 
before a specified date.Equity  swaps  involve  the  exchange  of  a  set  of  payments  whereby  one  of  these  payments  is 
based on an equity-linked return while the other is typically based on an interest reference rate 
 
Commodity  contracts  are  agreements  between  two  parties  to  exchange  cash  flows  which  are 
dependent on the price of the underlying physical assets. 
 
Total  Return  Swap  is  a  bilateral  financial  transaction  where  the  counterparties  swap  the  total 
return of a single asset or basket of assets in exchange for periodic cash flows. 
 
The  notional  amounts  of  certain  types  of  financial  instruments  provide  a  basis  for  comparison 
with instruments recognised on the balance sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of 
future  cash  flows  involved  or  the  current  fair  value  of  the  instruments  and,  therefore,  do  not 
indicate  the  Bank’s  exposure  to  credit  or  market  risks.    The  derivative  instruments  become 
favourable (assets) or unfavourable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates 
or foreign exchange rates relative to their terms. The aggregate fair values of derivative financial 
assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from time to time.The fair value of financial instruments that is not quoted in active markets is determined by using 
valuation techniques.   To the extent  practical,  cash  flow models  use  only  observable  data,  like 
interest  rate  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rate,  certain  data  like  credit  risk  (both  own  and 
counterparty),  volatilities  and  correlations  require  management  to  make  estimates.  Changes  in 
assumptions about these factors could affect reported fair value of financial instruments.3814

(All amounts expressed in RMB unless otherwise stated) 
[English translation for reference only]DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING(continued)1414.2  HEDGE ACCOUNTINGThe Bank applies hedge accounting in two separate hedging strategies, as follows: 
 
Interest rate risk on fixed rate financial assets and financial liabilities (fair value hedge) 
 
The Bank holds long-term fixed rate financial liabilities and therefore is exposed to changes in fair 
value  due  to movements in market rates.  The  Bank manages this risk exposure by  entering into 
receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps. 
 
Only  the  interest  rate  risk  element  is  hedged  and  therefore  other  risks,  such  as  credit  risk,  are 
managed  but  not  hedged  by  the  Bank.  The  interest  rate  risk  component  is  determined  as  the 
change in fair value of the long-term fixed rate financial assets and financial liabilities arising solely 
from changes in the benchmark rate of interest. Such changes are usually the largest component 
of the overall change in fair value.  
 
This strategy is designated as a fair value hedge and its effectiveness is assessed by comparing 
changes in the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities attributable to changes in the 
benchmark rate of interest with changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps. 
 
The  Bank  establishes  the  hedging  ratio  by  matching  the  notional  of  the  derivatives  with  the 
principal of the portfolio being hedged. Following reasons could cause ineffectiveness: 
 
1)  Differences  between  the  expected  and  actual  holding  amount,  as  the  Bank  hedges  to  the 
expected maturity date but may sell the bond investment according to trading strategies; 
 
2)  The  credit  risk  of  the  counterparty  impacts  the  fair  value  of  interest  rate  swaps,  but  has  no 
impacts on hedged items 
 
Foreign exchange risk on foreign currency debt (cash flow hedge) 
 
The  Bank  obtains  effective  sources  of  funding  from  international  markets.  The  foreign  currency 
risk component is then managed  and mitigated  by  the use  of  foreign exchange  contracts, which 
exchange  financial  liabilities  such as placements  from banks in  the foreign  currency  for financial 
liabilities  in  RMB.  These  instruments  are  entered  into  to  match  the  maturity  profile  of  estimated 
repayments of the Bank’s debt instruments. This hedging strategy is applied to the portion of the 
exposure that is not naturally offset against matching asset positions held by the Bank in financial 
investments also denominated in foreign currencies.  
 
The  foreign  currency  risk  component  is  determined  as  the  change  in  cash  flows  of  the  foreign 
currency debt arising solely from changes in the relevant foreign currency forward exchange rate. 
Such  changes  constitute  a  significant  component  of  the  overall  changes  in  cash  flows  of  the 
instrument.40DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

method. 
 
The  Bank  establishes  the  hedging  ratio  by  matching  the  notional  of  the  derivatives  with  the

the  expected  repayment  date  taking  into  account  expected  prepayments  based  on  past 
experience;

(b)     Cash flow hedge 
 
The  Bank’s  cash  flow  hedges  consist  principally  of  currency  swaps  transacted  to  hedge  highly 
probable  forecast  transactions  expected  to  occur  at  various  future  dates  against  variability  in 
exchange  rates.    The  currency  swaps  have  maturity  dates  that  coincide  within  the  expected 
occurrence of these transactions. 
 
For the year ended 31 December 2018, the Bank’s net loss from the cash flow hedge of RMB 3.36  
million  were  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  the  gain  and  loss  arising  from 
ineffective  portion  of  cash  flow  hedge  was  immaterial  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2018. 
There were no transactions for which cash flow hedge accounting had to be ceased for the  year 
ended 31 December 2018, as a result of the highly probable cash flows no longer being expected 
to occur.FINANCIAL ASSETS PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS

Pursuant to Circular Caijin No.49 issued by MOF in 2005, banks and certain other financial institutions 
in  the  PRC,  are  required  to  maintain  adequate  allowances  for  impairment  losses  against  their  risk 
assets. In addition, a general risk reserve should be established through the appropriation of retained 
earnings. This general risk reserve should form part of the owner’s equity of financial institutions. As a 
guiding  principle,  the  balance  of  general  risk  reserve  should  not  be  less  than  1%  of  the  aggregate 
amount  of  all  risk  assets.  On  17  April  2012,  MOF  issued  Circular  Caijin  No.20,  which  supersedes 
Circular  Caijin  No.49  and  raises  the  minimum  level  of  general  risk  reserve  to  1.5%  of  aggregated 
amount of all risk assets, which should be fulfilled in the next five years since July 2012.

On  30  January  2019,  the  directors  approved  the  appropriation  to  the  Bank's  general  risk  reserve 
amounting of RMB 62.7 million, in accordance with Circular Caijin No.20 issued in 2012. The general 
risk reserve after this appropriation amounts to RMB 1,297.6 million. 
 
The Ministry of Finance revised and issued CAS 21 (Lease), requiring non-listed companies to apply 
it from 1 January 2021, and early implementation is encouraged. The Bank has decided to early adopt 
the above accounting standards from 1 January 2019.CAS 21 (Lease) replaces the existing lease accounting guidance and requires almost all leases to be 
recognized on the balance sheet. It also changes the way in which lease expenses are presented in 
the  income  statement.  The Bank will  apply  CAS 21  (Lease)  on 1 January  2019,  using  the  modified 
retrospective approach.  The cumulative effect  of adopting CAS 21 (Lease) will  be recognized  as an 
adjustment to the opening balance of undistributed profits at 1 January 2019, with no restatement of 
comparative information.64DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

Compensation  &  Management  Development  Committee,  their  equivalent  cash  value  or  a 
combination.  Awards  consist  of  main  award  and  retention  award  (20%  of  main  award).  Dividends  onunvested shares do not accrue to employees.  The  main  award  vests  from  2  to  4  years  after  grant  i.e.  33%  will  vest  2  years  after  grant; 
another 33% will vest on the third year and the remaining 34% plus the retention award will 
vest 4 years after grant.  The awards will lapse immediately upon termination of employment, except in the event of illhealth, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or death.  The market price of shares on the grant date is used to estimate the fair value of the sharesawarded.  Vested  and  unvested  shares  are  subject  to  clawback/malus.

date of grant. For such cases, vested and unvested shares are subject to clawback/ malus.

58.1  Risk governanceThe Board oversees the Bank’s affairs and provides sound leadership for the CEO and management. 
Authorised by the Board, various Board committees oversee specific responsibilities based on clearly 
defined terms of reference. 
 
Under  the  Bank’s  risk  governance  approach,  the  Board,  through  the  Board  Risk  Management 
Committee (‘China BRMC’), sets the Bank’s risk appetite, oversees the establishment of  enterprise-
wide risk management policies and processes, and sets risk appetite limits to guide risk-taking within 
the Bank. 
 
The BRMC oversees the identification, monitoring, management and reporting of credit, market, 
liquidity, operational and reputational risks. To facilitate the BRMC’s risk oversight, the following risk 
management committees have been established: 
 
1.  Risk Executive Committee (Risk ExCo); 
2.  China Credit Risk Committee (CCRC);  
3.  China Market and Liquidity Risk Committee (CMLRC); and 
4.  China Operational Risk Committee (CORC). 
 
As  the  overall  executive  body  regarding  risk  matters,  the  Risk  ExCo  oversees  the  Bank’s  risk 
management as a whole. 
 
Each  of  the  committees  reports  to  the  Risk  Exco,  and  the  committees  as  a  whole  serve  as  an 
executive forum to discuss and implement the Bank’s risk management: 
 
Key responsibilities:  Assess and approve risk-taking activities;  
  Oversee  the  Bank’s  risk  management  infrastructure,  which  includes  frameworks,  decisioncriteria, authorities, people, policies, standards, processes, information and systems;  Approve risk policies; 
  Assess and monitor specific credit concentration; and 
Recommend  stress-testing  scenarios  (including  macroeconomic  variable  projections)  and 
review the results.73DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)58 
 
58.1  Risk governance(continued)The  members  in  these  committees  comprise  representatives  from  the  Risk  Management  Group 
(RMG) as well as key business and support units. 
 
The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) oversees the risk management function. The CRO is independent of 
business lines and is actively involved in key decision-making processes. He often engages with 
regulators to discuss risk matters, enabling a more holistic risk management perspective. 
 
Working closely with the risk and business committees, the CRO is responsible for the following:  Management  of  the  Bank’s  risks,  including  systems  and  processes  to  identify,  approve,measure, monitor, control and report risks;  Engagement with senior management about material matters regarding all risk types; 
  Development of risk controls and mitigation processes; and 
  Ensuring the Bank’s risk management is effective and the Risk Appetite established by theBoard is adhered to.58.2  Credit riskAThe  most  significant  measurable  risk  DBS  China  faces  is  Credit  risk,  which  arises  from  the  Bank’s 
daily  activities  in  various  businesses.  These  activities  include  lending  to  retail,  corporate  and 
institutional  customers;  it  includes  the  risk  of  lending,  pre-settlement  and  settlement  risk  of  foreign 
exchange, derivatives and debt securities. 
 
Credit Risk Management 
 
The Bank’s approach to credit risk management comprises the following building blocks:Policies 
 
The Bank localized Group Core Credit Risk Policy (“CCRP”) for Consumer Banking and Institutional 
Banking,  by  taking  account of the  local  laws, regulations  set  forth the  principles  by  which the  Bank 
conducts its credit risk management and control activities.   This policy supplemented by a number of 
operational  policies  and  standards,  ensures  consistency  in  identifying,  assessing,  underwriting, 
measuring, reporting and controlling credit risk across the Bank. 
 
The  operational  policies  and  standards  are  established  to  provide  greater  details  on  the 
implementation of the credit principles within the localized CCRPs and are adapted to reflect different 
credit environments and portfolio risk profiles.74DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

58.2  Credit risk (continued) 
 
B(i)(ii)(iii)Risk Methodologies 
 
Credit risk is managed by thoroughly understanding the Bank’s customers – the businesses they are 
in, as well as the economies in which they operate.  
 
Loans and advances and off balance sheet exposures 
 
The Bank uses internal rating system to identify, out of the 11 broad ratings in the system, the risk 
rating of the corporate borrowers. At the same time, the Bank also assigns credit risk grade to each 
facility  for  both  corporate  and  retail  borrowers  under  a  five  grade  asset  classification  system  to 
manage the  quality  of its  credit  portfolio.  Such  classification  system  is  based  on  “the  Guidance  on 
Credit Risk Classification” (”the Guidance”) issued by CBIRC. Under the Bank’s own system and the 
CBIRC  Guidance,  the  Bank  classifies  its  credit  assets  and  off-balance  sheet  credit  exposures  into 
five  categories,  which  are  namely  pass,  special  mention,  substandard,  doubtful  and  loss.  The  last 
three categories are also classified as “non-performing credit assets”.The core definition of the Bank’s credit asset classification is as follows: 
 
Pass:  The  borrower  is  able  to  fulfil  the  contractual  obligations,  and  there  is  no  uncertainty  thatprincipal and interest can be paid on time.Special  Mention:  The  borrower  is  able  to  make  current  due  payments,  but  there  exist  someindications that may have negative impact on the borrower’s future payments.Substandard:  The  borrower's  repayment  ability  has  been  in  doubt  and  its  normal  income  cannot 
repay  the loan principal and  interest in full. Losses may  be incurred by the Bank, 
even with the enforcement of guarantees and collateral.Doubtful: The borrower cannot repay the principal  and the interest in full. Significant losses will beincurred even with the enforcements of guarantees and collateral.Loss: After taking into consideration all possible recovery  actions  and necessary legal procedures, 
the  principal  and  interest  cannot  be  collected  or  only  a  very  small  portion  of 
principal and interest can be collected.Traded products and securities 
 
Counterparty  risk  that  may  arise  from  traded  products  and  securities  is  viewed  similarly  to  loan 
exposures and included under the Bank’s overall lending limits to counterparties. Issuer Default Risk 
that may arise from traded products and securities are generally measured and monitored via limits 
set by the Bank. 
 
Loans to other banks and financial institutions 
 
The  Bank  reviews  and  monitors  the  credit  risk  of  individual  financial  institutions  on  regular  basis. 
Limits  are  placed  for  each  individual  bank  or  non-banking  financial  institution  which  has  business 
relationship with the Bank.75DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

B 
 
(iv)Risk Methodologies (continued) 
 
Pre-settlement credit risk 
 
Pre-settlement  credit  risk for traded  products  arising  from a  counterparty’s  potentially  defaulting  on 
its obligations is quantified by an evaluation of the market price, plus potential future exposure. 
 
The  Bank actively monitors and manages its  exposure to  counterparties in over-the-counter (OTC) 
derivative  trades to protect  its balance sheet  in the event of counterparty  default. Counterparty risk 
exposures that may be adversely affected by market risk events are identified,  reviewed and acted 
upon  by  management,  and highlighted  to  the  appropriate risk  committees.  Specific  wrong-way  risk 
arises when the exposure to a counterparty directly correlates with the probability of defaulting due to 
the nature of the transactions. The Bank group has a policy to guide the handling of specific wrong-
way risk transactions, and its risk measurement metric takes into account the higher risks associated 
with such transactions. 
 
Issuer default risk that may also arise from derivatives, notes and securities are generally measured 
based on jump-to-default computations.CProcess, System and Reports 
 
The  Bank  constantly  invest  in  systems  to  support  risk  monitoring  and  reporting  for  its  Institutional 
Banking and Consumer Banking businesses.  
 
The  end-to-end credit process  is  constantly  being reviewed  and  improved through  various  front-to-
back  initiatives  involving  the  business  units,  the  operations  unit,  the  RMG  and  other  key 
stakeholders.  Day-to-day  monitoring  of  credit  exposures,  portfolio  performance  and  the  external 
environment factors potentially affecting credit risk profiles is key to the Bank's philosophy of effective 
credit risk management.  
 
In addition, risk reporting on credit trends, which may include industry analysis, early warning alerts 
and  significant  weak  credits,  is  submitted  to  the  various  credit  committees,  allowing  key  strategies 
and action plans to be formulated and evaluated. Credit control functions also ensure that any credit 
risks taken complies with group-wide credit risk policies and standards. These functions ensure that 
approved  limits  are  activated,  credit  excesses  and  policy  exceptions  are  appropriately  endorsed, 
compliance with credit standards is carried out, and covenants established by are monitored.76DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

DCollateral received 
 
Where  possible,  the  Bank  takes  collateral  as  a  secondary  source.  This  includes,  but  not  limited  to 
cash,  marketable  securities,  property,  trade  receivables,  guarantee,  inventory  and  equipment  and 
other physical and/or financial  collateral. The Bank may also take fixed and floating charges on the 
assets of borrowers.  
 
Policies  are  in  place  to determine the  eligibility  of collateral for credit  risk  mitigation.  These include 
requiring  specific  collaterals  to  meet  minimum  requirements  in  order  to  be  considered  as  effective 
risk mitigants.  The  Bank’s  collateral is  generally  diversified  and  periodic  valuations of  collateral are 
required.  Real  estate  and  cash  constitute  the  bulk  of  its  collateral,  while  marketable  securities  are 
immaterial. 
 
For derivatives, repurchase agreements (repo) and other repo-style transactions with financial market 
counterparties, collateral arrangements are typically covered under market-standard documentation, 
such  as  International  Swaps  &  Derivatives  Association  (ISDA)  Agreements  /  National  Association 
Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII)  Agreements and  Master Repurchase Agreements. 
The  collateral  received  is  mark-to-market  on  a  frequency  which  the  Bank  and  the  counterparties 
mutually agreed upon. This is governed by internal guidelines with respect to collateral eligibility. In the 
event of a default, the credit risk exposure is reduced by master-netting arrangements where the Bank 
is  allowed  to  offset  what  it  owes  a  counterparty  against  what  is  due  from  that  counterparty  in  a 
netting-eligible jurisdiction.  
 
Collateral  held  against  derivatives  generally  consists  of  cash  in  major  currencies  and  highly  rated 
government  or  quasi-government  bonds.  Exceptions  may  arise  in  certain  countries,  where  due  to 
domestic  capital  markets and  business  conditions, the Bank may  be  required to  accept  less highly 
rated or liquid government bonds and currencies. Reverse repo-transactions are generally limited to 
large  institutions  with  reasonably  good  credit  standing.  The  Bank  takes  haircuts  against  the 
underlying collateral of these transactions that commensurate with collateral quality to ensure credit 
risks are adequately mitigated. 
 
In  times  of  difficulty,  the  Bank  will  review  the  customer’s  specific  situation  and  circumstances  to 
assist them in restructuring their repayment liabilities. However, should the need arise, disposal and 
recovery processes are in place to dispose of collateral held by the Bank. The Bank also maintains a 
panel of agents and solicitors that helps it to dispose of non-liquid assets and specialised equipment 
quickly. 
 
 
Other Risk Mitigants 
 
The  Bank  accepts  guarantees  as  credit  risk  mitigants.  Internal  thresholds  for  considering  the 
eligibility of guarantors for credit risk mitigation are in place.E77DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

58.2  Credit risk (continued)FCredit risk lossesExpected Credit Loss (ECL) 
 
All  financial  assets,  except  for  financial  assets  classified  or  designated  as  FVPL  and  equity 
securities, are subject to impairment and recognition of ECL. Off-balance sheet financial instruments 
that are also subject to ECL include financial guarantees and undrawn loan commitments.  
 
Under new CASs of financial instruments, ECL will be assessed using an approach which classifies 
financial instruments into three stages, each of which is associated with an ECL requirement that is 
reflective of the assessed credit risk profile.  A financial asset is classified under: 
 
Stage  1,  if  it  was  not  credit-impaired  upon  origination,  and  there  has  not  been  a  significant 
increase  in  its  credit risk.  Stage  1  ECLs  are  measured  as  the  credit  loss  that  is expected  to 
result from a default occurring within the next 12 months; 
Stage 2, if it was not credit-impaired upon origination but has since experienced a significant 
increase in credit risk. Stage 2 ECLs are measured as the lifetime expected credit loss from a 
default from the expected remaining life of the instrument.  
Stage  3,  if  it  has  been  credit-impaired  with  objective  evidence  of  default.  Stage  3  ECLs  are 
also measured as lifetime expected credit loss from the expected remaining life of the financial 
instrument.The  application  of  the  impairment  requirements  under  new  CASs  of  financial  instruments  are 
described in greater detail below.  
 
Measurement of ECLs 
 
ECLs  are  unbiased  estimates  of  credit  losses  determined  by  evaluating  a  range  of  possible 
outcomes  and  taking  into  account  past  events,  current  conditions  and  assessments  of  future 
economic conditions. The measurement of ECL is typically a product of the instrument’s probability 
of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) discounted using the original 
effective interest rate to the reporting date.  
 
The Bank leverages the models / parameters implemented under the Basel II Internal Ratings-Based 
(IRB)  framework  where  feasible  and  available,  with  calibration  to  meet  the  new  CASs  of  financial 
instruments requirements. For portfolio without appropriate Basel model / parameters, other relevant 
historical  information,  loss  experience  or  proxies  will  be  utilised  if  deemed  feasible,  with  a  view  to 
maximise the use of available information that is reliable and supportable. LGD have been primarily 
determined on a collective basis grouped by industry or products with shared risk characteristics.  
 
A  simplified  approach  using  appropriate  proxies  has  been  applied  to  estimate  the  ECL  for  other 
assets such as trade receivables. 
 
The Bank’s approach to retail and wholesale portfolios including key judgements is set out below.7858

Expected Life 
 
When  measuring  the  ECL  for  Stage  2  assets,  cashflows  over  the  expected  remaining  life  of  the 
financial  asset  are  considered.  For  most  financial  instruments,  this  is  the  same  as  the  remaining 
contractual life which represents the maximum contractual period over which the Bank is exposed to 
the credit risk of the customers. 
 
However, the expected remaining life of some retail revolving products may exceed the contractual 
maturity.  For  these  products,  a  behavioural  expected  remaining  life  is  estimated  using  the  Bank’s 
internal historical data based on the period over which the Bank is exposed to the credit risk of such 
customers. 
 
Assessments of significant increase in credit risk 
 
The analysis underpinning the assessment of whether a financial asset has experienced a significant 
increase  in  credit  risk  since  origination  is  dependent  on  a  range  of  qualitative  and  quantitative 
factors. 
 
For  wholesale  exposures,  financial  instruments  are  deemed  to  have  experienced  a  significant 
increase in credit risk when:  
 
observed  changes  in  the  probability  of  default,  as  observed  by  a  downgrade  in  the  Bank’s 
internal  credit  risk  rating  for  each  obligor  between  initial  recognition  and  reporting  date,  are 
more than pre-specified thresholds and;exposures are placed on specific categories of internal credit “watchlists” for closer scrutiny of 
developing credit issues.For retail exposures, days past due is the main driver, supplemented with a PD based criterion. 
 
In any event, all retail and wholesale exposures that are more than 30 days past due are considered 
to have demonstrated a significant increase in credit risk and are classified as Stage 2.   
 
A  Stage  2  exposure  can  migrate  back  to  Stage  1  if  it  is  assessed  that  there  is  evidence  of  a 
sustainable improvement in its credit profile. 
 
The Bank has not used the low credit risk exemption for any financial instruments.79DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

Definition of default for credit-impaired financial assets 
 
Exposures  are  classified  as  Stage  3  if  deemed  to  be  credit-impaired  or  have  suffered  objective 
evidence  of  default  as  at  the  reporting  date.  The  definition  of  default  that  is  applied  under  new 
CASs of financial instruments is consistent with that specified in the Basel regulatory capital rules. 
 
The Bank assesses whether there is evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is 
impaired  at  each  balance  sheet  date.  The  Bank  carries  out  regular  and  systematic  reviews  of  all 
credit facilities extended to customers. The criteria that the Bank uses to determine whether there is 
evidence of an impairment loss include: 
 
 
Significant  financial  difficulty  of  the  issuer  or  obligor,  including  breach  of  covenants  and/  or 
financial conditions;  
A breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments;  
Granting  of  a  concession  to  the  borrower,  for  economic  or  legal  reasons  relating  to  the 
borrower’s financial difficulty, that the Bank would not otherwise consider;  
High probability of bankruptcy or other financial re-organisation of the borrower. 
 
A Stage 3 exposure can be upgraded to Stage 2 if there are reasonable grounds to conclude that 
the  obligor  is  able  to  service  future  principal  and  interest  payments  on  the  credit  facility  in 
accordance with the restructured terms. 
 
Financial  assets  are  written-off,  in  whole  or  in  part,  when  it  has  exhausted  all  practical  recovery 
efforts  and  has  concluded  that  there  is  no  reasonable  expectation  of  recovery  in  full  or  as 
determined by the Monetary Authority.

For  the  wholesale  portfolios,  Credit  risk  Cycle  Indices  (CCIs)  have  been  developed  for  significant 
industries  and  geographies  using  expected  default  frequencies.    Expected  default  frequency  is  a 
market based default risk measure driven by equity prices, market volatility and leverage. CCIs are 
then used as inputs to  convert the  through-the-cycle  PDs from Basel models  /  parameters into  the 
point-in-time  equivalents  and  also  to  incorporate  forward-looking  factors  into  the  PDs.  LGDs  are 
based  on  historical  data  adjusted  for  latest  and  forecasted  recovery  experience.  Basel  EADs  are 
reduced  by  contractual  repayments  to  derive  the  forecasted  EAD  for  stage  2  exposures.  No 
adjustments are made to Basel EADs for stage 1 exposures. 
 
For  retail  portfolios,  forecasted  loss  rates  based  on  adjustments  to  historical  loss  experience, 
informed  by  management’s  forecast  on  relevant  macroeconomic  variables,  such  as  property-price 
indices and unemployment rates, are used. 
 
Expert credit judgement and post model adjustments 
 
The measurement of ECLs requires application of expert credit judgement. Key areas of judgement 
include: 
 
The  risk  rating  assignment  and  determining  whether  exposures  should  be  placed  on  credit 
watchlists; 
Determination of the criteria for significant increase in credit risk; 
Establishment of groups of similar financial assets for measuring ECL; 
Forecast  and  the  selection  of  macro-economic  variables  such  as  property-price  indices, 
unemployment rates and gross domestic product and determining its effect on the loss rates 
for the retail portfolio; and 
Adjustments made as part of the post-model adjustment framework (elaborated below).Post-model Adjustment based on regulatory guidanceThe  ECL  amount  calculated  from  the  model  is  further  adjusted  in  accordance  with  the  relevant 
guidance  issued  by  CBIRC.  After  such  adjustments,  the  Bank’s  ECL  allowance  for  loans  and 
advances  reaches  2.5%  of  the  gross  amount  of  loans  and  advances  and  246%  of  non-performing 
loans as at 31 December 2018.81DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)5858.3  Market risk (continued)A  Market Risk Management (continued)Risk Methodologies 
 
Value-at-Risk (VaR) is  a  method that computes the potential losses on risk positions as a result  of 
market movements over a specified time horizon and according to a given level of confidence. The 
Bank’s VaR model is  based on historical simulation  with  a one-day holding period. The  Bank uses 
Expected Shortfall (ES), which is the average of potential loss beyond a given level of confidence, to 
monitor  and  limit  market  risk  exposures.  ES  is  supplemented  by  risk  control  metrics  such  as 
sensitivities to risk factors and loss triggers for management action. 
 
The  Bank  conducts  back-testing  to  verify  the  predictiveness  of  the  VaR  model.  Back-testing 
compares  VaR  calculated  for  positions  at  the  close  of  each  business  day  with  the  Profit  and  Loss 
(P&L)  that  actually  arises  in  those  positions  on  the  following  business  day.  The  back-testing  P&L 
excludes  fees  and  commissions,    revenues  from  intra-day  trading,  and  non-daily  valuation 
adjustments and time effects.  
 
For back-testing, VaR at the 99% level of confidence and over a one-day holding period is used. The 
Bank  adopts  the  standardized  approach  to  compute  market  risk  regulatory  capital  for  the  trading 
book positions. As such, VaR back-testing does not impact the Bank’s regulatory capital for market 
risk. 
 
VaR  models  allow  the  Bank  to  estimate  the  aggregate  portfolio  market  risk  potential  loss  due  to  a 
range  of  market  risk  factors  and  instruments.  However,  there  are  limitations  to  VaR  models.  For 
example, past changes in market risk factors may not provide accurate predictions of future market 
movements, and the risk arising from adverse market events may be understated.To monitor the Bank’s vulnerability to unexpected but plausible extreme market risk-related events, 
the  Bank  conducts  multiple  market  risk stress  tests  regularly.  These  cover trading  and non-trading 
portfolios  and  follow  a  combination  of  historical  and  hypothetical  scenarios  depicting  risk-factor 
movement. 
 
ES  and  Net  Interest  Income  (NII)  Variability  are  the  key  risk  metrics  used  to  manage  the  Bank’s 
assets  and  liabilities.  As  an  exception,  credit  spread  risk  arising  from  loans  and  receivables  is 
managed  under  the  credit  risk  management  framework.  The  Bank  also  manages  banking  book 
interest rate risk arising from mismatches in the interest rate profiles of assets, liabilities and capital 
instruments  (and  associated  hedges),  which  includes  basis  risk  arising  from  different  interest  rate 
benchmarks,  interest  rate  re-pricing  risk,  yield  curve  risks  and  embedded  optionality.  The  Bank 
measures interest rate risk in the banking book on a weekly basis. 
 
Processes, Systems and Reports 
 
Robust internal control processes and systems have been designed and implemented to support the 
Bank’s market risk management approach. The Bank reviews these control processes regularly, and 
these reviews allow senior management to assess their effectiveness. 
 
The RMG Market and Liquidity Risk unit – an independent market risk management function 
reporting to CRO – monitors, controls and analyses the Bank’s market risk daily.87DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

58.4  Liquidity riskAThe  Bank’s liquidity risk arises from its  obligations to  honour withdrawals of deposits, repayments of 
borrowed funds at  maturity, and the commitments to its customers to extend loans to the customers. 
The  Bank  seeks  to  manage  its  liquidity  in  a  manner  that  ensures  that  its  liquidity  obligations  will 
continue to be honoured under normal as well as adverse circumstances. 
 
Liquidity Risk Management 
 
China MLRC is the primary party responsible for liquidity risk management based on the Liquidity Risk 
Management Policy approved by China BRMC, and reports to China Risk Exco. 
 
The Bank’s Assets and Liabilities Committee regularly reviews balance sheet composition, growth in 
loans  and  deposits,  utilization  of  wholesale  funding,  momentum  in  business  activities,  market 
competition,  economic  outlook,  market  conditions  and  other  factors  that  may  affect  liquidity  in  the 
continual refinement of the Bank’s funding strategy. 
 
The Bank’s approach to liquidity risk management comprises the following building blocks: 
 
Policies 
 
The  Liquidity  Risk  Management  Policy  sets  out  the  Bank’s  overall  approach  towards  liquidity  risk 
management and describes the range of strategies employs to manage its liquidity. These strategies 
include  maintaining  an  adequate  counterbalancing  capacity  to  address  potential  cashflow  shortfalls 
and having diversified sources of liquidity.  
 
The Bank’s counterbalancing capacity  includes liquid assets, the capacity  to borrow from the  money 
markets (including the issuance of Negotiable Certificate of Deposit (NCD)), and forms of managerial 
interventions that improve liquidity. In the event of a potential or actual crisis, the Bank has in place a 
set of liquidity contingency and recovery plans to ensure that the Bank maintains adequate liquidity. 
 
The  Liquidity  Risk  Management  Policy  is  supported  by  Standards  that  establish  the  detailed 
requirements for liquidity risk identification, measurement, reporting and  control within the Bank. The 
set  of  Policies  and  Standards  communicate  these  baseline  requirements  to  ensure  consistent 
application throughout the Bank.Risk Methodologies 
 
The  primary  measure used to  manage  liquidity within  the  tolerance  defined  by  China  BRMC  is  cash 
flow maturity mismatch analysis.  This form of analysis is performed on  a regular basis  under normal 
and adverse scenarios. It assesses the adequacy of the Bank’s counterbalancing capacity to fund or 
mitigate  any  cash  flow  shortfalls  that  may  occur  as  forecasted  in  the  cash  flow  movements  across 
successive  time  bands.  To  ensure  that  liquidity  is  managed  in  line  with  the  Risk  Appetite,  core 
parameters such as the types of scenarios, the survival period and the minimum level of liquid assets, 
are  pre-specified  for  monitoring  and  control  on  a  bank-wide  basis.  Any  occurrences  of  forecasted 
shortfalls  that  cannot  be  covered  by  the  counterbalancing  capacity  will  be  escalated  to  the  relevant 
committees for evaluation and action. 
 
Liquidity  risk  stress  testing  is  performed  regularly  using  cashflow  maturity  mismatch  analysis,  and 
covers  adverse  scenarios  including  general  market  and  idiosyncratic  stress  scenarios.  Stress  tests 
assess  the  Bank’s  vulnerability  when  liability  run-offs  increase,  asset  rollovers  increase  and/or  liquid 
asset  buffers  decrease.  In  addition,  ad  hoc  stress  tests  are  performed  as  part  of  the  Bank’s  ICAAP 
exercises.89DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

ALiquidity Risk Management (continued) 
 
Liquidity  risk  control  measures,  such  as  liquidity-related  ratios  and  balance  sheet  analysis,  are 
complementary  tools  for  cashflow  maturity  mismatch  analysis,  and  they  are  performed  regularly  to 
obtain  deeper  insights  and  finer  control  over  the  Bank’s  liquidity  profile.  The  liquidity  risk  control 
measures  also  include  concentration  measures  regarding  top  depositors,  wholesale  borrowing  and 
swapped funds. 
 
Processes, Systems and Reports 
 
Robust  internal  control  processes  and  systems  support  the  Bank’s  overall  approach  in  identifying, 
measuring, aggregating, controlling and monitoring liquidity risk in the Bank.  
 
The  RMG  Market  and  Liquidity  Risk  unit  –  an  independent  liquidity  risk  management  function 
reporting to CRO – manages the day-to-day liquidity risk monitoring, control reporting and analysis.   
 
Liquidity Risk in 2018 
 
The  Bank  actively  monitors  and  manages  the  liquidity  profile  through  cash  flow  maturity  mismatch 
analysis.  In  forecasting  cash  flow  under  the  analysis,  behavioural  profiling  is  necessary  in  cases 
where a product has indeterminate maturity or the contractual maturity does not realistically reflect the 
expected cash flow. 
 
The  table  below  shows  behavioural  net  and  cumulative  maturity  mismatch  between  assets  and 
liabilities over a one-year  period, in a normal  scenario without incorporating  growth projections. The 
Bank’s liquidity was observed to remain adequate in the maturity mismatch analysis.

13,187,891,903IFRS  No.7  specifies  a  hierarchy  of  valuation  techniques  based  on  whether  the  inputs  to  those  valuation 
techniques  are  observable  or  unobservable.  Observable  inputs  reflect  market  data  obtained  from 
independent  sources;  unobservable  inputs  reflect  the  Bank’s  market  assumptions.  These  two  types  of 
inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: 
 
• Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.•  Level  2  –  Inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  included  within  Level  1  that  are  observable  for  the  asset  or 
liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices). This level includes the 
majority  of  the  OTC  derivative  contracts  and  RMB  debt  instruments  traded  in  inter-bank  market.  The 
sources  of  input  parameters  like  LIBOR  yield  curve  or  counterparty  credit  risk  are  Bloomberg  and  China 
Bond. 
 
• Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs). This level includes structured financial instruments.This  hierarchy  requires  the  use  of  observable  market  data  when  available.  The  Bank  considers  relevant 
and observable market prices in its valuations where possible.95DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

(c)Assets and liabilities not measured at fair value but disclose their fair value 
 
Fair  values  estimation  is  made  in  accordance  with  information  of  market  and  financial  instruments  in 
some 
 specific point. Estimation is based on following methods and supposition: 
 
 
Cash and due from other banks and financial institutions, Deposits with the central bank, Deposits with 
other  banks,Due  to  other  banks  and  financial  institutions,  Interest  receivable,  Interest  payable,  Other 
assets and Other liabilities. 
 
Given that maturities of these financial assets and liabilities are either short-term or re-priced more than 
once every year; the carrying amount approximates the fair value, belonging to level 2. 
 
Loans and advances 
 
Because  the  RMB  loan  interest  rates  follows  the  movement  of  PBOC  benchmark  interest  rates,  and 
interest tares for loans denominated in foreign exchange are generally floating rates, fair value of loans is 
close to carrying value.  
 
Customer deposits  
 
The fair value of current, savings and money market accounts is the amount payable on demand at the 
reporting date.  The carrying value of fixed interest-bearing deposits and placements approximates to its 
fair value because they are mainly payable in short term period. 
 
The  Bank  takes  the  date  on  which  events  causing  the  transfers  between  the  levels  take  place  as  the 
timing  specific  for  recognising  the  transfers.  There  are  no  significant  transfers  in  or  out  regarding  to 
assets or liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss and categorised within Level 3. There is 
no transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 for current year.97DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED
