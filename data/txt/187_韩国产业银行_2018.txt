FIISince its founding in 1954, Korea Development Bank
has been the backbone of the development of 
the economy and the financial industry in Korea. 
In an era of continuing challenge and rapid change, 
KDB is now transforming its traditional role as 
Korea’s leading policy finance institution to create 
an ecosystem for innovative industries, and support 
the 4th Industrial Revolution.In this annual report, we share how we are  
building a broad platform for innovative, global, 
and sustainable growth.003Message from the Chairman & CEO004Dear Clients and Readers,
2019  is  a  momentous  year  for  the  Korea  Development  Bank 
(KDB) as it celebrates the 65th anniversary of its founding. I would 
like to express my deep appreciation to our clients, readers and 
stakeholders for the trust and unwavering support over the years that 
enabled us to come this far.Last year was a meaningful time for KDB as we continued to fulfill our 
policy financing mandate while serving as a financial control tower for 
Korea’s innovation-driven growth, leading to a total funds provision 
of KRW 67 trillion. At the same time, KDB strengthened its financial 
soundness by marking yet another profitable year.In order to promote growth drivers for the future of the Korean 
economy, we launched the Innovation & Growth Banking Center 
in charge of financially supporting the country’s innovative growth 
efforts and preparing for the 4th Industrial Revolution. We also 
bolstered the operations of our market-driven venture investment 
platform, the KDB NextRound, taking the lead in building a financial 
ecosystem for innovative ventures and start-ups.Approximately  68%  of  the  total  funds  supplied  in  2018  were 
concentrated on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to reinforce 
our support for these corporate segments. As for companies under 
our restructuring portfolio, we applied principle-based normali- 
zation procedures appropriate for each, and were able to overcome 
some of the most critical restructuring challenges weighing down the 
economy. Most importantly, however, 2018 proved to be a turning 
point to really focus our competencies in driving the innovative 
growth of Korea.The business environment we face in 2019 calls for even greater 
endeavors. The ongoing trade conflicts among major economies 
and increasing protectionism across the world are threatening the 
competitiveness of the country's traditional mainstay industries and 
amplifying uncertainties.Against this backdrop, KDB will work toward the economy’s new leap 
by supporting innovative companies that show creativity and techno-
logical potential while uncovering new growth engines, thus creating 
an environment that would enable a smooth generational shift to take 
place among existing companies.With this in mind, we have set following goals for 2019 to tackle the 
tasks assigned to us and to create a brighter future for KDB and Korea.First, we will lead a future-oriented finance.
In response to the escalating competition in today’s fast changing 
financial ecosystem, KDB will expand its financial services that 
customize to clients’ diversifying needs by leveraging the strength 
in  corporate  and  investment  banking.  We  will  introduce  new 
financial techniques, develop new products, and adopt network-
based financing to further enhance our business capacity while 
strengthening competencies in the capital markets.In order to secure growth engines for the future and renew vitality of 
the economy, we will also reinforce our function as a platform that 
supports Korea’s innovative ventures. This will include capturing firms 
with new business models through the credit appraisal system tailored 
to innovation-driven companies engaged in new industries, expanding 
KDB NextRound and special on-lending, all aimed at solidifying thefoundation to discover start-ups in their early developing stages. We 
hope that these new attempts will lay a rich foundation for the country's 
innovative growth.Second, we will concentrate on improving the fundamentals of the economy by 
supporting SMEs and strengthening the competitiveness of major industries.
To better serve the needs of companies in different growth phases, 
we plan to extend the existing financial products with tailored services. 
We will cultivate the grounds for innovative companies that show great 
potential to grow, and at the same time, continue to support SMEs 
with greater magnitude.Through various programs, mainly the KDB Global Challengers 
200 and KDB-Tech program, we plan to provide extensive financial 
packages, ranging from consulting services to comprehensive 
financial solutions, to carefully selected MEs and pre-MEs with 
outstanding technology and growth potential to help them become 
globally competitive companies. In addition, we will encourage 
constructive partnership among the country’s large companies, MEs 
and small-scale ventures by bolstering vehicles such as the Mutual 
Growth Fund.Third, we will lead the advancement of Korea’s financial industry and 
increase our social role in policy finance.
KDB will strengthen its local network in Asia to solidify business 
foundation  and  build  up  competitiveness  in  the  region  with  a 
particular focus on growing ASEAN countries. By invigorating the 
current business matrix between the headquarters and our global 
bases, we will uncover and broaden our participation in project 
financing, cross-border financing, and other high-return opportunities. 
Not only will we stand by and support the Korean SMEs’ expansion 
into overseas markets but firmly establish our reputation as a truly 
global KDB competing on the global stage.In order to promote corporate responsibilities, we seek to expand 
special financial products for job creation and enterprises with 
strong social values. Moreover, we will facilitate socially responsible 
investments including climate projects as an implementing entity 
of the Green Climate Fund and issuance of sustainability bonds. 
Finally, we will make preparations for any inter-Korean economic 
cooperation,  thereby  providing  the  national  economy  a  great 
opportunity for advancement.As Korea’s leading policy finance institution, KDB has been at the 
forefront of the Korean economy over the last 65 years, successfully 
performing a role that is distinctive from other financial institutions. 
In 2019, every one of our staff in KDB will make committed efforts to 
fulfill our roles in policy finance, thus opening the door to the next 30 
years of KDB.On behalf of all of us at KDB, I would like to thank you for the 
confidence you have placed in us and ask for your continued trust 
and support.Lee, Dong Gull

an innovative start-up ecosystem. We increased 
our support for SMEs and MEs, thereby improving 
the fundamentals of the Korean economy. Even

advisory services for overseas project finance. We also helped 
Korean companies enter the overseas infrastructure business 
through leveraging the Global Infrastructure Fund (GIF) and the 
Global Infrastructure Venture Fund (GIVF).P. 24. 26Identified new business opportunitiesin overseas marketsKDB is committed to becoming ‘Global KDB’ competing on a

bond and social bond in 2018, thereby contributing to the development of socially responsible finance market in Korea. 
The proceeds from the green bond will be used to support the low-carbon green projects in Korea, while the proceeds 
from the social bond will be used to help resolve social issues in Korea, including job creation, in line with international 
guidelines on social bonds. As such, finance is more than a tool for generating profits for KDB, but instead we use it as 
a way to resolve social issues and build a sustainable society, thus performing a pioneering role in socially responsible

KDB facilitates the stable growth of Korean companies and leads the innovative growth of  
the national economy.Corporate Banking
REVIEW OF 2018    KDB takes a leading role in policy finance 
in Korea, and supports the sustainable growth of the national 
economy. While offering customized financial services through 
its wide range of financial products, KDB proactively facilitates 
preemptive corporate structural adjustments and supports business 
realignments in an effort to create a more advanced industrial 
structure. By promoting the growth of medium-sized enterprises 
(MEs) and providing extensive financial support to the 4th Industrial 
Revolution-related companies, KDB advocates the enhancement of 
corporate competencies and the sustainable growth of the national 
economy.Amid  growing  uncertainties  in  2018,  domestic  companies 
have strived to cope with the changes towards the 4th Industrial 
Revolution. In response, KDB has reached out to the different 
needs of each company by providing sufficient funds for facility 
investments in core industries, and has also actively induced 
them  to  reorganize  their  businesses  in  order  to  secure  new 
growth engines, thereby supporting the overall competitiveness 
improvement throughout the industry.Moreover,  the  Bank  has  encouraged  affiliates  of  corporate 
groups facing temporary liquidity problems to take preemptive 
restructuring measures. At the same time, based on systematic 
risk management, KDB provided effective financial tools to the 
companies in financial difficulty to prevent the crisis from spreading 
to the whole economy.As Korea’s leading policy finance institution, KDB plays an active 
role in shaping diverse economic and industrial policies, together 
with other government agencies and policy finance institutions.Landmark deal of 2018Comprehensive financial services forLG Display’s facility investmentOVERVIEWLG Display made facility investments into its OLED business as part

for balanced growth between large corporations and SMEs & MEs 
through the win-win cooperation program, KDB has also continued 
its efforts to identify and provide financing to promising new MEs in 
order to expand its client base and contribute to job creation.Of the total KRW 67.3 trillion of funds supplied by KDB in 2018, KRW 
45.6 trillion, or 67.8% of the total, was provided to SMEs and MEs. 
In particular, KRW 0.5 trillion was funded through ‘Mutual Growth 
Fund’, a fund created specifically to boost the growth of SMEs 
and MEs. KDB also operates ‘KDB Global Challengers 200’, a 
program developed to foster the growth of MEs. The program aims 
to provide 200 MEs or preliminary MEs possessing outstanding 
technologies and growth potential with comprehensive services so 
that they can grow further into leading global companies. In 2018, 
60 companies were selected and provided with consulting and 
comprehensive financial services.Funds supplied

ongoing trade tensions and slowing global economy. In addition, 
ample liquidity within domestic companies and the robust growth 
of capital markets in Korea are likely to reduce companies’ reliance 
on banks for capital, which will in turn further intensify competition in 
the corporate loan market.KDB will stay focused on leading innovative growth and improving 
economic vitality. We will continue to help companies secure 
engines for future growth and improve their competitiveness, while 
at the same time boosting our own competencies in policy banking.In this regard, we will continue with the ‘KDB Global Challengers 
200’ program and select 40 more companies this year. We will also 
bring together MEs looking for new business opportunities and 
SMEs & ventures with innovative technologies in new growth fields, 
and provide additional financing where necessary. In addition, KDB 
will continue to make every effort in promoting the job creation 
at SMEs & MEs and support social enterprises through special 
financial products such as ‘Job Creation Support Fund’ and ‘Socially 
Responsible Business Support Fund’.Corporate Restructuring
REVIEW OF 2018     KDB acts as a safety net for the Korean 
economy and its major industries by supporting principle-based 
and efficient restructurings. In particular, the Bank proactively 
improves the business fundamentals and competitiveness of 
Korean companies by responding promptly to potential insolvencies 
at large corporate groups.In 2018, KDB set up an optimal normalization plan for Kumho Tire 
through an in-depth financial and non-financial analysis of the 
company.  We  then  laid  the  groundwork  for  normalization  by 
attracting new outside investors following mediation between 
the conflicting interests of investors, labor unions, management, 
the government, and creditors. In the case of STX affiliates, KDB 
reacted to the unique circumstances of each affiliate through 
successful M&As and sales, thereby completing the restructuring 
works and reducing uncertainty. In addition, KDB has supplied 
liquidity to the market for corporate restructuring and contributed to 
building a foundation for market-driven restructuring by cooperating 
with other financial institutions.PLANS FOR 2019    In 2019, KDB will continue to act as a market 
safety net based on its consistent corporate restructuring principles. 
In particular, we will leverage our extensive experience and expertise 
in corporate restructuring to encourage companies to engage in 
voluntary structural realignment and make financial improvements, 
thereby  helping  them  to  avoid  insolvency  and  improve  their 
competitiveness. For financially distressed companies, we will take 
prompt and efficient measures for an effective restructuring, which 
will not only enable companies to revive their operations but also 
contribute to revitalization of the Korean economy and industrial 
ecosystem.g

BI019Capital Markets
KDB will stay at the forefront of financial and industrial innovation as a global capital market 
player as well as a reliable capital arranger for businesses.Debt Capital Markets
REVIEW OF 2018    KDB is the only bank in Korea with the license 
to arrange the domestic corporate bond issuances. On the back 
of this privilege, KDB arranges or underwrites the issuance of 
domestic securities, provides advisory services on structured 
finance and syndicated loans, and arranges the issuance of 
international bonds.In 2018, KDB supplied a substantial amount of foreign currency 
to the Korean economy by arranging public offerings and private 
placements of corporate bonds in international markets. We 
have diversified our product line-up by arranging the issuance 
of increasingly popular hybrid and green bonds. We made a 
successful entry into the international green bond market by 
arranging the issuance of green bonds for Korea Hydro & Nuclear 
Power and LG Display worth USD 600 million and USD 300 million, 
respectively.Following 2017, KDB also co-arranged the issuance of the Foreign 
Exchange Stabilization Bond worth USD 1 billion, strengthening 
its partnership with the Korean government and contributing to 
the external credibility of the Republic of Korea. Despite interest 
rate hikes in the U.S., the US-China trade dispute, and challenging 
conditions in emerging markets, the deal attracted the largest 
volume of subscription ever for the Bond, resulting in the lowest 
spread over the benchmark in history, while also enabling potential 
reduction in the cost of overseas borrowings for Korean issuers and 
extending the overall maturity of the nation’s external debt.Furthermore, KDB has strengthened its support for innovative 
growth of SMEs and MEs by leveraging the capital markets. We set 
up customized funding plans for underperforming businesses, and 
provided funds to SMEs and MEs with outstanding technologies 
to help them develop new businesses, which in turn contributed to 
strengthening the competitiveness of companies competing in the 
era of the 4th Industrial Revolution.PLANS FOR 2019    In 2019, KDB aims to broaden its structured 
finance business overseas by leveraging its strategic partnerships 
with global financial institutions. It will also make inroads into new 
markets and increase its market share of green bond and hybrid 
bond space in order to continue its leading role in arranging foreign 
currency funding for domestic companies. In addition, KDB will 
offer debt capital market products specifically designed for new 
industries and SMEs & MEs in its efforts to support government 
policies  on  innovative  growth.  KDB  will  also  offer  structured 
products to improve companies’ access to capital markets, as 
well as other products which cater to the specific characteristics of 
different industries and companies.M&A
REVIEW  OF  2018        KDB  arranges  financing  for  companies 
undertaking M&A as part of its financial advisory services to help 
them secure additional funds and improve their capital structure. In 
2018, the Bank successfully advised on the sales of Kumho Tire, STX 
Engine, and STX Corporation, thereby playing its role in facilitating 
the restructuring of major industries in Korea. We also advised Asia 
Cement on its acquisition of Halla Cement, thus contributing to 
streamlining the domestic cement industry.In addition, KDB advises SMEs and MEs on M&As in order to help 
them develop drivers for new growth. KDB arranged financing for 
Kolmar Korea’s acquisition of CJ HealthCare, and the refinancing 
for Prostar Capital’s takeover of Kyungnam Energy. The Bank 
provided financial advisory services to Baba Fashion in its takeover 
of Hiphoper, an online retailer, which enabled this medium-sized 
manufacturer of women’s wear to move beyond the traditional 
manufacturing sector and to meet the challenges of the 4th Industrial 
Revolution. In addition, three more MEs signed up to join the ‘M&A 
Growth Partnership’1), an M&A platform developed specifically for 
SMEs and MEs. KDB was also active in global M&A markets, as it 
arranged financing for the acquisition of Nature’s Care, an Australian 
company, by a Chinese private equity fund, and the acquisition of 
I-MED, also of Australia, by a British private equity fund.PLANS FOR 2019    KDB will continue to focus its resources on 
helping SMEs and MEs secure drivers of new growth and offer one-
stop advisory services tailored to new business through the ‘M&A 
Growth Partnership’ program. While also providing new growth 
companies and those operating in the 4th Industrial Revolution 
with M&A advisory services fit for different growth stages, KDB 
will partner with other related institutions to help them acquire new 
technology, overcome managerial challenges, and make exits on 
initial investments. Furthermore, KDB will facilitate cross-border 
M&As to help Korean companies secure new growth engines, and 
it will support the overseas expansion of Korean companies by 
sourcing more overseas targets through building stronger ties with 
global institutions and expanding its global networks.1)  A  specially  developed  program  to  help  SMEs  and  MEs  with  their  M&A 
transactions by providing comprehensive services, ranging from consulting 
to the final execution020Consulting
REVIEW OF 2018     Since 2003, KDB has been involved with  
over 800 projects in a wide range of sectors, including manage-
ment & financial consulting, public service & development consulting, 
and corporate turnarounds, as well as in-house and overseas 
consulting. In 2018, we focused on growth diagnostics and business 
strategy consulting for companies in the growth and maturity 
phases, as well as on corporate diagnostics and turnaround 
consulting for companies in financial distress. Another key focus 
was providing consulting services to companies selected for 
the ‘KDB Global Challengers 200’ program, with an aim to help 
them achieve innovative growth. In addition, KDB has built an 
online consulting platform which enables it to communicate more 
efficiently with SME and ME clients, and to react more promptly to 
their consulting needs.PLANS FOR 2019    KDB plans to utilize its online consulting 
platform to meet the growing demand from corporate clients for 
consulting services, and will tailor its services to each phase of 
the business life cycle. At a time of slowing growth in Korea, KDB 
will provide support to SMEs and MEs by offering high quality 
consulting services so that they can meet the challenges of the 4th 
Industrial Revolution.Private Equity
REVIEW  OF  2018     Since the beginning of its private equity 
business in January 2005, KDB has set up 28 private equity funds 
(PEFs) and built up an extensive track record in fund management, 
including buy-out, growth, and mezzanine financing. As of the 
end of 2018 Q3, total capital commitments amounted to KRW 
6,890.6 billion with 16 funds under management. KDB ranks 
second in Korea by total funds committed, with a market share of 
approximately 8%.Total capital commitments

2,828In 2018, KDB formed the ‘KDB Small & Medium Mezzanine PEF’, 
size totaling KRW 150 billion, to provide funds to SMEs and MEs 
which need to reorganize their business portfolio and/or improve 
their financial structure. KDB also formed the ‘Infrastructure Initiative 
1st PEF’, size totaling KRW 90 billion — the Bank’s first blind pool 
fund to invest solely in the green & energy infrastructure projects. 
In addition, it utilized its existing ‘KBS-KDB PEF’ to nurture media 
contents development in Korea, and played a pioneering role in 
the Asian capital markets by partnering with International Finance 
Corporation (IFC) to invest in companies from emerging markets in 
Asia through the ‘KDB Asia PEF’.PLANS FOR 2019    The PEF market in Korea is expected to grow 
more slowly in 2019, and under the ample market liquidity and 
strong competition among blind pool fund managers, we expect 
a market more favorable for investee companies. Top-tier fund 
managers in Korea are accelerating their expansion overseas, with 
investments expected to be particularly robust in newly-developing 
and rapidly-growing Asian countries.KDB plans to leverage its existing blind pool funds to build up 
quality assets in the 4th Industrial Revolution-related companies and 
infrastructure projects. This action will support innovative growth 
and job creation in the domestic economy by supplying long-term 
growth capital through PEFs. The Bank will also explore ways to 
increase rates of return and achieve higher payouts by enhancing 
the value of its existing portfolio and seeking early exits. This will 
also enable KDB to attract idle funds, and thus establish a virtuous 
cycle in the Korean capital market. Moreover, KDB will enhance its 
status in global capital markets by increasing its efforts to promote 
overseas investment and strengthen ties with other international 
organizations.g

BI021Innovation & Growth Banking
KDB will lead innovative growth in Korea by responding proactively to changes in markets and 
the demands of the 4th Industrial Revolution.Leading Innovative Growth
To reestablish its policy banking role as the leading policy finance 
institution for innovative growth, KDB is reorganizing its functions 
to intensify its support for innovative ventures and start-ups. To this 
end, KDB elevated the Innovation & Growth Banking Center to a 
Division in January 2019, to bolster overall financial support for the 
4th Industrial Revolution. KDB is also implementing a system to 
efficiently induce the transformation of industrial structure towards the 
4th Industrial Revolution, and will continue to support and contribute 
to the acceleration of innovative growth by fostering future-oriented 
new industries. While creating an innovative start-up ecosystem 
by expanding its services for technology-orientated start-ups, KDB 
will strengthen its policy role in promoting innovative growth by 
increasing its support for the scale-up of innovative companies.Establishing a System for the 4th Industrial 
Revolution
In 2018, KDB undertook a wide range of measures aimed at driving 
the growth of innovative companies that are vital in creating new 
jobs, and helping existing industries to embrace the 4th Industrial 
Revolution. Reflecting the latest global trends in technology and 
government policies, KDB established the ‘Common Criteria for 
Innovative Growth’, and based on these criteria, we specified 
300 items of innovative growth, to effectively implement relevant 
support measures. In addition, KDB set up the ‘Innovation Growth 
Intelligence System’ in cooperation with other policy finance 
institutions in order to systematically analyze and report information 
on  the  4th  Industrial  Revolution.  This  system  will  enable  the 
continuous update of the Criteria, and will ensure effective policy 
finance implementation for innovative growth.In 2019, driven by the 4th Industrial Revolution, we expect industrial 
convergence to intensify. Accordingly, KDB will strengthen its role 
as a communications channel between the Korean government 
and  other  policy  finance  institutions  and  will  further  improve 
cooperation with private financial institutions. We will seek to add to 
the Criteria new industries and technologies with strong potential, 
and provide new growth engines with financial services they need, 
thus contributing to the transformation of Korean economy towards 
an innovative growth-oriented industrial structure. The Innovation 
Growth Intelligence System will continue to be an analysis tool for 
innovative growth, and will be enhanced to become an integrated 
platform for the government, policy finance institutions, and private 
financial institutions.Venture & Technology Banking
In line with the government policy towards developing innovative 
growth engines, KDB is actively engaging in the identification and 
promotion of promising technologies and companies through direct 
investments. In addition to direct investments into equity, convertible 
bonds (CBs), and bonds with warrants (BWs) of start-ups and SMEs 
with outstanding technologies and ideas, KDB operates special-
purpose funds to support the growth of the domestic venture 
capital market. KDB launched the ‘2018 Hanhwa New Industry 
Global Plus-up Fund’ in cooperation with KOTRA, raising KRW 50 
billion to help innovative start-ups attract global investments and 
expand overseas. KDB is currently preparing to launch ‘KDB-ME 
Open Innovation Fund II’, size totaling KRW 20.1 billion, to promote 
mutual cooperation and growth of MEs and start-ups.022Launched in August 2016, ‘KDB NextRound’ is a market-driven 
venture investment platform connecting start-ups and SMEs with 
investors. Since its launch, a total of 738 innovative companies 
have undertaken 215 rounds of investor relations (IR) activities, 
with 130 of them attracting a combined total of KRW 709.7 billion. 
In addition, this platform has been improved by adding the ability 
to attract overseas venture capital, and by introducing companies 
according to their business types and geographical distributions. 
These qualitative and quantitative improvements have made KDB 
NextRound into Korea’s leading venture investment platform.The Bank also provides comprehensive financial support for the 
industry-academia-research cooperation that will be essential in 
establishing a virtuous cycle in the development, transfer, and 
commercialization  of  technologies.  We  are  currently  running 
the ‘KDB R&BD (Research & Business Development) Financial 
Support Program’ to provide SMEs and start-ups with the funds 
they need for technology development. As of the end of 2018, KDB 
has provided a total of KRW 22.9 billion to 13 companies through 
the program, thereby contributing to the vitalization of R&BD 
ecosystem.In 2019, KDB will take the initiative to expand the KDB NextRound 
and increase its direct investments into start-ups. We also plan to 
strengthen the competitiveness of start-ups by launching ‘Global 
Partnership Fund IV’, a platform for the global expansion of Korean 
start-ups, to help them leverage the expertise and networks of 
overseas venture capital. Going forward, we will lead the innovative 
growth of Korea by continuing to support the development, transfer, 
and commercialization of promising technologies through industry-
academia-research cooperation.Indirect Investment
KDB supplies companies with customized funding according to the 
growth phase of each company, via private equity (PE) and venture 
capital (VC) funds managed by private fund managers. We have 
established the ‘Growth Support Fund’, ‘Growth Ladder Fund’, and 
‘New Industry Development Fund’ in order to support government 
policy, while also leading the venture capital market in Korea 
through market-friendly investments. In particular, KDB took the lead 
in forming the Growth Support Fund, targeted at companies in their 
growth or exit phases, and the Fund is expected to grow to KRW 
8 trillion in size by 2020. In 2018, its first year of operations, KDB 
formed 18 funds totaling KRW 2.9 trillion under the Growth Support 
Fund umbrella.As of the end of 2018, KDB had invested a total of KRW 6.1 trillion 
in 179 funds, establishing itself as a key investor in the Korean fund 
business. In addition, KDB is committed to promoting an innovative 
investment culture by bringing about a venture capital market that is 
driven by the private sector and by expanding the autonomy of fund 
managers.Indirect investment volume

2.1KDB will continue to develop an innovative start-up ecosystem in 
2019 through the proactive supply of venture capital. As the Growth 
Support Fund enters its second year, we will supply more growth 
capital to SMEs and MEs as well as start-ups, and support the 
development of the 4th Industrial Revolution. Moreover, we will help 
regional economies achieve innovative growth by forming funds 
which will identify and support local companies with strong growth 
potential.On-lending
On-lending  is  a  market-friendly,  indirect  policy  finance  tool 
specifically  developed  for  SMEs  and  MEs.  When  financial 
intermediaries, such as commercial banks in Korea, request funds 
on behalf of their SME or ME clients, KDB supplies long-term 
funds at low interest rates to the intermediaries, after reviewing the 
qualifications of each client.In 2018, KDB supplied a total of KRW 8.3 trillion to 8,110 companies 
through on-lending. More than 61%, totaling KRW 5.1 trillion in size, 
was provided to SMEs and MEs as long-term funds, with maturities 
of three years or more. In addition, we have supported innovative 
growth by introducing ‘Special On-lending for Smart Farms’, ‘Special 
On-lending for the 4th Industrial Revolution Core Technologies’, and 
other new products.In 2019, KDB plans to increase the volume of long-term, low interest 
rate on-lending. Furthermore, we will develop a sustainable basis

BI023Project Finance
KDB supports the balanced, sustainable growth of the Korean economy through project finance 
focused on social overhead capital (SOC), public works as well as new and renewable energy.Domestic Project Finance
REVIEW OF 2018    KDB provides a comprehensive range of 
project finance (PF) services, including financial advisory and 
arrangement, to cater to the needs of the sponsors in SOC, power, 
plants/resources, public real estate projects as well as shipping 
and aviation financing.In 1995, KDB pioneered the PF market in Korea by successfully 
arranging financing for the construction of the Incheon Interna-
tional Airport Highway. Since then, KDB has led the advancement 
of financial institutions in Korea, while fulfilling its policy role in 
supporting the expansion of the national infrastructure, improve-
ments in power supply, and growth in the regional economies. To 
this end, we have worked in partnership with the private sector, 
encouraging financial institutions to undertake long-term invest-
ments.In 2018, KDB confirmed its status as the PF market leader in Korea by 
arranging financing for 30 projects — 7 SOC projects and 23 regional 
development projects — totaling KRW 11.8 trillion. KRW 8.2 trillion 
out of this was arranged for SOC projects, including the Gwang 
myeong-Seoul Expressway, the privately-funded Guri-Pocheon 
Expressway, and Seosan Photovoltaic Generation. KDB also 
arranged financing totaling KRW 3.6 trillion for real estate projects, 
including the Guro G-Valley Multi-purpose Facility Development, the 
Asan Smart Valley General Industrial Complex Development, and 
the publicly-funded Gocheok-dong Rental Housing Development, 
thereby contributing to the revitalization of regional economies.PLANS FOR 2019    In the SOC sector, KDB’s strategy is to invest 
in private investment projects led by financial investors (FIs), 
where financial institutions develop the project in partnership with 
engineering firms. The Bank also plans to expand its participation 
in new and renewable energy projects, an area in which major new 
projects are expected to emerge as a result of government policies 
promoting new energy industries and renewable energy.In real estate sector, KDB will support the construction of industrial 
infrastructure for SMEs and MEs, including industrial complexes 
and knowledge-based industry centers. In addition, we will respond 
to the government’s housing policy by participating in projects to 
build publicly-funded rental housing for young adults and for the 
general public. Moreover, we will promote more participation in 
regional development projects aimed at benefiting a wider public.024Overseas Project Finance
REVIEW OF 2018    KDB began its overseas project finance (PF) 
business in 2003, and has since established an overseas deal 
sourcing network with a particular focus on local professionals. The 
first local PF desk was opened in Singapore in 2011, followed by 
New York in 2015, and London and Beijing in 2016.In 2018, KDB arranged financing for 20 overseas projects totaling 
USD 1.2 billion, and 46 projects in shipping and aviation financing 
worth  USD  6.7  billion.  Overseas  PF  deals  included  Midway 
Solar Power Project in the U.S., Bulgana Wind Farm in Australia, 
Kia Motors’ Gas-fired Power Plant in Mexico, and Duqm Export 
Refinery Complex in Oman. In shipping and aviation financing, we 
completed financing arrangements for BBAM’s acquisition of 65 
aircrafts from AirAsia, and successfully arranged the financing for 
Zodiac Group’s purchase of six new container ships.PLANS FOR 2019    KDB will diversify its overseas business in 2019 
by building up expertise in financial advisory and strengthening its 
networks with leading global investment institutions. In addition, the 
Bank will leverage its extensive experience in renewable energy to 
encourage major domestic companies wanting to increase their 
use of renewable energy to consider a corporate power purchase 
agreement (PPA)1). In shipping and aviation financing, through 
targeted marketing we will expand our current Asia-based asset 
portfolio with assets from the U.S. and Europe by establishing direct 
sales channels and networks with shipping and airline companies 
in those regions.1)  Corporate PPA: A legal contract whereby a company purchases electricityfrom an independent power producer instead of a utility companyTrading
KDB will solidify its market position by leveraging the experience it has accumulated over many 
years of pioneering the trading market in Korea.F/X & Derivatives Trading
REVIEW OF 2018    KDB was the pioneer in the Korean trading 
market in the 1980s when F/X and derivatives products were 
scarce in Korea. In the 1990s, KDB led the development of the 
KRW interest rate swap and KRW/USD currency option markets, 
and has since led the KRW derivatives market. For some 30 years, 
we have accumulated capabilities required to deal in a wide range 
of products, ranging from F/X, swaps, options, and other basic 
derivatives to complex structured derivatives.In 2018, four interest rate hikes by the Fed and the US-China 
trade conflict caused increasing uncertainty and concerns over a 
global economic slowdown. In this challenging environment, KDB 
leveraged its extensive experience and expertise to offer hedging 
products customized to the specific needs of its corporate clients. 
We provided interest rate swap products to SMEs and MEs, and 
offered in-depth currency risk advisory services for innovative 
companies. In addition, as the chair bank of the Foreign Exchange 
Committee in Korea, KDB took the lead in adopting the Statement 
of Commitment to the F/X Global Code, thus further enhancing 
transparency of the Korean F/X market.PLANS FOR 2019    Amidst the continuing market uncertainties 
in 2019, KDB will continue to provide its clients with products 
specifically tailored to their requirements. KDB will aim to expand 
its business spheres and secure new growth engines by attracting 
more  F/X  and  derivatives  trading  from  both  domestic  asset 
managers and non-resident clients. We will also focus on our 
role as a market maker in carbon emissions trading, which will 
both support government policy and solidify our reputation as the 
Korea’s leading derivatives trader.Money Market & Capital Market Trading
REVIEW OF 2018    KDB leverages its overseas financial networks 
to establish proactive securities trading strategies, thereby providing 
a round-the-clock trading system; we can stay ahead of market 
volatility at home and abroad.In  2018,  KDB  increased  the  proportion  of  its  investments  in 
corporate bonds with an AA or higher rating, and in the sovereign 
bonds of major economies. We also focused on minimizing risk and 
maximizing returns through portfolio diversification, flexible hedging, 
and duration adjustments. Following the opening of the Chinese 
stock market to foreign investors, KDB became the first Korean 
bank to win Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) and RMB 
Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) licenses in 2009 and 
2015, respectively. This has helped us to make active inroads into 
the securities markets of emerging countries. Moreover, KDB was 
cited for its contributions as a primary dealer for Korean Treasury 
Bonds by the Minister of Economy and Finance in 2018, for the 
fourth consecutive year.PLANS FOR 2019    In 2019, volatility in global financial markets is 
expected to increase, mainly due to the global economic slowdown 
and growing financial uncertainties in emerging markets. KDB will 
expand its global trading book to better manage risk and pursue 
stable profitability, focusing on investment-grade sovereign bonds of 
advanced economies, and diversification of its portfolio. In addition, 
as the leading fixed income house in Korea, KDB will continue to 
play a vital role in the domestic securities market, by supporting 
bond issuances of its clients and contributing to the advancement 
of the secondary bond market in Korea through solidifying its role 
as a primary dealer.g

BI025Overseas Business
KDB leverages its global competitiveness and international networks to support overseas 
expansion of Korean companies and the global advancement of the Korea’s financial industry.Active Overseas Expansion
KDB is playing a leading role in the globalization of Korean financial 
institutions, and is leveraging its overseas networks to support 
the government’s New Southern Policy. Moreover, we encourage 
Korean companies to expand their global market presence by 
offering comprehensive corporate banking services ranging from 
loans to bond issuance, PF, M&A, shipping and aviation financing, 
consulting and derivatives trading.KDB has 26 overseas locations across 19 countries; 1 regional 
head office, 9 branches, 5 subsidiaries, 9 representative offices, 
and 2 expatriate employees. We are constantly pursuing our 
globalization strategy to expand the overseas network and diversify 
our operations. In 2018, KDB increased its presence in Southeast 
Asia, a region of rapid growth in finance. The Asia Regional Head 
Office was established in Singapore, and the establishment plan for 
Jakarta Representative Office received approval from the Indonesian 
financial authorities, thereby supporting the New Southern Policy 
and further accelerating our move towards becoming ‘Global KDB’. 
The Asia Regional Head Office, in particular, played an important 
role as we developed effective business strategies to facilitate our 
operations in Asia, which in turn enabled us to improve our asset 
portfolio for higher profitability.In 2019, KDB will accelerate its overseas expansion by exploring 
opportunities  for  acquiring  local  financial  institutions  and  by 
upgrading the Ho Chi Minh City Representative Office to a branch.Cross-Border Syndicated Loans
KDB attracted new major clients in 2018 by entering new emerging 
markets, and enjoyed fruitful results as a result of taking an 
active role in arranging loan financings. We provided financial 
arrangement services for the Winson Oil International (Hong 
Kong), Haitong International Securities (Hong Kong), Indiabulls 
Housing Finance (India), Yes Bank (India) and Reliance Industries 
(India). As well as being successful in their own right, these deals 
will act as bridgeheads for Korean financial institutions to launch 
their businesses in global financial markets. The deal for Reliance 
Industries, India’s biggest private company, was of particular 
significance — KDB put together a USD 2.5 billion syndicated 
loan in cooperation with leading global investment banks, proving 
its capabilities and establishing a presence in a major emerging 
economy.In 2019, KDB will respond to the New Southern Policy by expanding 
its presence in global syndicated loan markets, with a particular 
focus on emerging economies in Asia. We will work in partnership 
with global financial institutions, and develop specific strategies for 
each target country with a focus on their growth industries. This will 
establish a strong overseas presence for KDB, and further enhance 
our reputation in the global market.Trade Finance
KDB offers comprehensive trade finance services to domestic 
companies, and is the 5th largest provider of trade finance in Korea. 
In 2018, KDB provided USD 35.6 billion of export & import trade 
finance, up approximately 10% over the previous year.Export and import financing supplied

participation. For the first time among Korean financial institutions, 
KDB opened trade finance credit lines guaranteed by international 
financial institutions for banks from emerging nations. In 2018, we 
further expanded our trade finance business by offering direct trade 
loans to banks in emerging countries.KDB will widen its trade finance business in 2019 by continuing 
to  provide  comprehensive  trade  finance  services  to  Korean 
companies, expanding its risk participation trade volume and the 
pool of client banks for trade loans business.026Pension & Trust
The strength of KDB’s pension operations lies in the asset management know-how we have 
long accumulated as Korea’s leading corporate banking specialist.Pension
As of the end of 2018, KDB ranked 11th in terms of pension assets 
under management (AUM) among 43 domestic pension operators 
in Korea. KDB’s pension AUM increased by 9.3% from 2017, 
reaching KRW 5.8 trillion at the end of 2018. The pension market 
is expected to grow further on growing attention to post-retirement 
finances in an era of aging population, low-growth, and low-interest 
rates.Custody balance

21,181Regulations are expected to be eased further in 2019 with the 
potential enactment of the Trust Business Act which is aimed at 
improving and expanding the trust market in Korea. Targeted new 
products will be launched in response to the growing interest of 
individual customers in trust services in an era of aging population 
and low economic growth. In addition, SMEs and MEs will have 
more access to funding through the utilization of collateral trusts.As the external business environment continues to evolve, KDB 
will strengthen its role as a trustee bank specializing in corporate 
finance. We will achieve this by developing customized asset 
management plans to improve rates of return and meet the other 
requirements of our corporate clients. In custody business, KDB will 
actively target investment funds and strengthen ties with funds of

boost its pension asset management capabilities.Trust
KDB retains, operates, and manages a wide range of assets 
entrusted  to  it,  including  monetary  assets,  real  estate,  and 
debentures, granting them to beneficiaries upon maturity. KDB 
began its money trust business in 1989, and eventually expanded 
into property trust and custody business over the years.In 2018, trust assets increased by 47.4% compared to the previous 
year on the backdrop of increased rates of return on money trusts 
and an active expansion of property trust business. The custody 
balance of assets also went up by 4.8% driven mostly by the Korea 
Fund of Funds and the Growth Support Fund.Trust assets balance

and strict liquidity management.KDB Bonds
KDB issues Industrial Finance Bonds (KDB Bonds) in KRW and 
foreign currencies to procure the resources required to supply 
funds for the promotion of sustainable growth in accordance with 
the Korea Development Bank Act.As stipulated in the Act, KDB is protected by the government 
from insolvency as a state-owned policy bank, and it enjoys the 
same credit rating as the government in terms of risks under 
Basel III. As a result, KDB bonds are issued at the lowest spread 
against the benchmark among special bonds (bonds issued by 
public organizations) and financial bonds, except for government-
guaranteed special bonds (Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation 
Bonds and Korea Student Aid Foundation Bonds).• KRW-denominated     In 2018, the Korean economy grew 
at a rate near to its potential growth rate, triggering an increase in 
the Bank of Korea’s base rate in November, the first in 12 months. 
Major economies underwent monetary policy normalization, with the 
U.S. Federal Reserve hiking the federal funds rate four times. Yields 
on KRW-denominated bond decreased compared to the previous 
year mainly attributable to a slowing economy in Korea and growing 
concerns over the US-China trade dispute.KDB  Bonds  issued  in  2018  totaled  KRW  51.7  trillion,  and  the 
outstanding balance marked KRW 97.2 trillion, each number growing 
by KRW 0.5 trillion from 2017. The total outstanding balance is the 
third largest behind Korea Treasury Bonds and Monetary Stabilization 
Bonds. Moreover, the market interest rate of KDB bonds is utilized 
as a key benchmark rate in the bond market by the Korea Financial 
Investment Association along with those of Korea Treasury Bonds 
and Monetary Stabilization Bonds, maintaining its solid status as a 
representative market interest rate.KDB Bonds and outstanding balance

lowered its financing costs through 8 issuances of structured KDB 
Bonds and 26 interest rate swaps. In addition, KDB contributed 
to the promotion of sustainable finance by issuing its first KRW-
denominated green bond in May and first social bond in October, 
each in the size of KRW 300 billion, both being firsts for the Korean 
market.030Recent key bond rates trend

maintaining a flexible financing policy, and enhance the reputation 
of the KDB Bonds and broaden its investor base through a market-
friendly approach. We will also ensure a stable supply of capital for 
industries through flexible financing which responds to the market 
environment and our own internal funding requirements.• Foreign  currency-denominated      Despite increasing 
volatility in financial markets in 2018, triggered by U.S. Federal 
Reserve interest rate hikes, KDB was able to secure foreign currency-
denominated funds totaling USD 6.4 billion. The Bank also issued 
global bonds, EUR-denominated bonds, and Samurai bonds, and thus 
established benchmarks for Korean issuers’ foreign currency funding. 
In addition, we diversified our financing channels by launching into 
niche markets, such as CHF, Formosa, and Kangaroo bonds, attracting 
supranational, sub-sovereign, and agency (SSA) investors across 
different regions.In 2019, our funding strategy will continue to focus on flexibility, bracing 
for potential changes in the market from base rate changes. In addition 
to USD-denominated global bonds, KDB will constantly monitor 
market conditions and serve as Korea’s benchmark borrower in 
various markets covering EUR, JPY-denominated bonds, sustainability 
bonds, etc. Simultaneously, we will make concerted efforts to improve 
borrowing conditions for Korean institutions while expanding our SSA 
investor base.Deposits
KDB contributes to the efficient supply of policy funds by taking 
deposits to supplement KDB Bonds, which are sensitive to market 
conditions. The Bank strengthens its competitiveness as a policy 
bank by maintaining an adequate level of deposits in order to 
reduce interest rate risk and by keeping funding costs low through 
attracting money market accounts and other low-cost deposits.Although interest rates continued to fluctuate in 2018, KDB was able 
to attract low-cost funds, such as money market deposit accounts,by launching distinctive deposit products that do not require face-
to-face customer interaction and by leveraging social media 
marketing. In particular, we launched ‘Daily Plus Free Installment 
Savings’ in May to meet the latest customer requirements, attracting 
approximately 17,000 accounts by year-end. Moreover, by linking 
this new product to money market deposit accounts, we have 
expanded our customer base and contributed to efficient and 
stable funding.Competition among banks to attract deposits will become even 
fiercer in 2019, due to tougher regulations on the loan-deposit 
ratio, which will lead to an increase in funding costs. Against this 
backdrop, KDB will ensure a stable supply of policy financing by 
employing a number of deposit-taking strategies. First, we will 
leverage our strength as a corporate banking specialist to expand 
our deposit services and financial support for SMEs and MEs. 
Second, we will expand our wealth management services for 
premier customers, and train more private banking specialists. 
Third, we will respond proactively to the changing environment 
for banking by rolling out intelligent banking systems which offer 
customer-tailored interactive screen and other non-face-to-face 
services.Liquidity Management
KDB ensures the stable management of liquidity through diverse 
management strategies including operations of call loans, repo, 
MMF, and CP, utilizing its surplus funds.As volatility in the global financial market is expected to increase, 
likely due to changes in rate policies of major economies, KDB will 
look to avoid liquidity gaps through preemptive risk management by 
maintaining an optimal level of liquidity by closely monitoring market 
conditions and flexibly adapting to supply-and-demand swings.Against this backdrop, KDB strives for stable management of 
funds based on diversified investment by product type and maturity 
structure to pursue appropriate liquidity and risk management.tn

SII031Risk ManagementKDB maintains financial soundness and 
stability in its business activities through  
the effective management of a diverse range 
of risks based on fundamental principles of 
risk management.KDB’s Risk Management Principles•  Risk must be managed in a manner that is independent,comprehensive, and uniform on a bank-wide basis;•  Risk must be accurately identified, measured and evaluated,and then properly managed;•  Risk must be maintained at a level in balance to profit;•  Risk must be diversified to prevent a buildup of assetsconcentrated in a specific category; and•  Risk must be managed within certain limits or guidelines inorder to prevent undue exposure.Effective Risk Management  
by Specialized Councils
KDB operates independent risk management committee and 
council to ensure prompt and effective risk management decision-
making.  The  Risk  Management  Committee  (RMC)  is  KDB’s 
highest decision making body that examines important matters 
such as yearly risk management plans and total risk limits for the 
Bank. The RMC members are mainly comprised of independent 
directors with extensive experience and knowledge in finance and 
economic matters. Chaired by one of the independent directors, 
the Committee is armed with a decision-making mechanism that 
ensures balanced views on critical risk management agenda. All 
agenda items resolved by the RMC are reported to the Board of 
Directors.In 2018, a total of 25 agenda items were presented for discussion 
to the Committee. Major agenda items adopted for resolution 
included the risk management plans for 2018, and the setting 
of exposure limits by country. Other important risk management 
issues were also reported to the Committee, including the analysis 
report on bank-wide stress test results and verification report on 
the BIS capital ratio.The Risk Management Council is comprised of Division Heads, and 
its roles and responsibilities include the monitoring of the Bank’s 
constant risk variables, and the orchestration of operations, so 
that risks can be effectively managed within each operation unit. 
Following the limits set by the Committee, the Council discusses 
and distributes the risks among Divisions, sets limits for trading 
losses and F/X positions. In 2018, the Council was convened 10 
times with agenda items including the credit portfolio management 
plans and the distribution of internal capital limits.Key committees and councils for risk managementBoard of DirectorsRisk Management Committee•  A committee within the Board of Directors(Chair: Independent director, Members: Independent

event that debts cannot be collected as a result of a failure of 
counterparties to make repayments or to fulfill their payment 
obligations in other ways. While monitoring all assets that are 
exposed  to  credit  risk,  we  also  measure  and  manage  credit 
concentration risk, which can occur as a result of excessive 
exposure to individual companies or corporate groups.• Market  risks      Market risks refer to possible losses to 
the Bank’s assets resulting from fluctuations of interest rates, 
stock prices, F/X rates, and other variables. KDB measures and 
manages possible losses in trading positions (including positions 
in securities and derivatives held for trading) due to negative 
movements in market indices. Moreover, by classifying the severity 
of market changes into three stages — precautionary, semi-crisis, 
and crisis stages — in accordance with the degree of benchmark 
fluctuations,  we  operate  Market  Risk  Contingency  Plans 
appropriate to each of the three stages. KDB also conducts stress 
tests to measure the potential scale of losses based on scenarios 
replicating significant fluctuations in major market indices over the 
last three years and the financial crisis in 2008.• Interest rate risks     Interest rate risks refer to possible losses 
due to interest rate fluctuations that cause a decrease in net present 
value (NPV) or net interest income (NII) of rate-sensitive assets and 
an increase in interest expenses on rate-sensitive liabilities. KDB 
manages interest rate risk mainly through Value at Risk (VaR), and 
also employs Earnings at Risk (EaR), duration gap, and repricing 
gap as auxiliary management indices.• Liquidity risks     Liquidity risk is defined as the possibility of 
potential loss due to a temporary shortage in funds caused by a 
maturity mismatch or an unexpected capital outlay. Liquidity risk 
soars when funding rates rise, assets are sold below a normal 
price, or a good investment opportunity is missed. KDB uses Basel 
III’s short-term liquidity regulation index, the liquidity coverage 
ratio (LCR), and a mid to long-term liquidity regulation index, the 
net stable funding ratio (NSFR) to manage its liquidity risks, and 
manages them to exceed the regulatory requirements.• Operational risks     Operational risks refer to possible losses 
that may occur due to inadequate internal procedures, failed 
system, employee errors, as well as external events that disrupt 
business processes. Through a Control Self-Assessment (CSA) 
program implemented at three-month intervals, we make sure that 
the relevant staff at each department is fully aware of the potential 
operational risks associated with their job functions, and can 
properly manage those risks. We established business continuity 
plans for each job function to prepare for potential disruptions due 
to disasters, strikes, and other emergencies. Annual mock drills are 
held to ensure that major operations can be resumed within a target 
timeframe in the event of an emergency.Asset Soundness Management 
KDB  categorizes  the  soundness  of  its  assets  as  ‘normal’, 
‘precautionary’, ‘substandard’, ‘doubtful’, or ‘estimated loss’ based 
on an evaluation of the possibility of insolvency and sets loan loss 
provisions according to the categorization. Starting from 2018, 
KDB makes reasonable estimates of the probability of defaults as 
well as loss given defaults, and sets aside adequate level of loan 
loss provisions using the expected credit loss (ECL) impairment 
model in line with the International Financial Reporting Standards 9 
(IFRS 9).KDB constantly strives to minimize the insolvencies and puts 
necessary measures into place, including requiring additional 
collateral and the early collection of debts. If assets become non-
performing, we seek possibilities for corporate normalization, or 
manage the assets through sales or write-offs.REVIEW  OF  2018        In  2018,  KDB  further  improved  its  risk 
management systems in support of its vital role in policy finance. 
We continued with our portfolio rebalancing, by reducing the 
concentration risk of exposures to large corporations, and diversifying 
the portfolio with exposures to new growth industries and SMEs. 
Furthermore, to promote risk diversification, we took into account 
the risk and growth potential of each company in managing 
exposure limits. To increase the effectiveness of the overall portfolio 
management, we introduced a branch performance evaluation 
system  linked  with  exposure  management  at  each  branch, 
contributing to the improvement of our asset soundness.KDB has been actively responding to changes in the regulatory 
environment. In 2018, we successfully adopted the NSFR regulation, 
as well as the IFRS 9. In addition, we established a ‘contingency 
plan for BIS ratio’ to properly manage the Bank’s capital adequacy 
in the event of an emergency.PLANS FOR 2019    KDB will continue with its efforts to further 
improve its risk management systems in order to secure future 
growth drivers. To this end, we will establish guidelines to induce 
increased exposures to SMEs and MEs as we continue to foster 
promising industries and innovative companies. We will seek for 
any improvement in our risk governance to ensure sustainable 
policy financing, and keep the management informed with timely 
risk analyses for practical risk-based decision-making.Moreover, we will stay ahead of changes in financial regulations. 
In 2019, domestic regulatory authorities are expected to set out 
enforcement standards for the new Basel III regulations and other 
regulations related to large-scale exposures in order to enhance 
the stability of financial systems in Korea. We will ensure that 
KDB adopts the new regulations as seamlessly and effectively as 
possible.tn

SII033Research & 
Credit ReviewKDB is expanding the breadth of its research 
to support the sustainable growth of national 
economy and set the direction for economic 
development on the Korean Peninsula.Industry & Technology Research
KDB undertakes industry reviews & analysis, including industry 
assessment and forecast, as well as industry issue analysis. 
In  addition,  it  undertakes  technology  reviews,  technological 
competitiveness evaluation, and intellectual property (IP) value 
evaluation on behalf of its corporate clients. This research supports 
KDB’s main operations, including risk management, loans and 
investments, and also helps to fulfill its role in policy finance by 
improving the industrial structure in Korea and nurturing new growth 
industries. KDB shares its knowledge of industrial development by 
publishing the research results in periodicals and by presenting 
them in seminars.In 2018, KDB created a new research team dedicated to new 
technologies and new industries of the 4th Industrial Revolution, 
including smart factories, artificial intelligence, and blockchains. 
The team undertook research on ventures, including start-up case 
studies and the development of KDB Venture Index. KDB received 
Level 4 Tech Credit Bureau (TCB) Certification, the highest rating, 
from Korea Credit Information Services by meeting the manpower, 
evaluation model, track record, and system integration standards 
set forth in the government-issued ‘Roadmap for implementing 
Technology Financing’.KDB will provide its mid to long-term forecasts in the ‘Strategy 
Report  on  Future  Industries’  in  order  to  strengthen  the 
competitiveness of core industries. In addition, we will undertake 
global research, with a focus on studying overseas industries and 
technology, and deepen our cooperation with overseas institutions 
to support the government’s New Southern Policy. Other targets for 
2019 include improving the accuracy of our industry assessment 
models, expanding the scope of assessment target industries, and 
reducing the time taken for each assessment.Credit Review
In 2018, KDB adopted ‘Credit Review System for New Industries 
and Innovative Companies’ in order to better cope with a wide 
range  of  funding  requirements  that  innovative  companies 
experience during their business life cycle. The System transcends 
traditional practices of requiring track records or collateral, and 
instead analyzes the comprehensive value of new technologies,business models, their potential ripple effects on industry and 
market, growth potential, and market reputation. The System has 
enabled KDB to actively support innovative companies that have 
won positive market recognition for their innovation and potential for 
growth, but not have had timely access to capital due to lack of a 
proven track record. In addition, the Bank has been strengthening 
the management of its credit exposure to corporate groups by 
establishing working capital credit line limits on 23 largest corporate 
groups and by setting up an exposure management plan for small 
and medium-sized corporate groups.In 2019, KDB plans to gradually expand its overseas credit review 
workforce in line with its strategy of expanding global network in Asia. 
We will also expand the task force for the System in order to better 
support innovative growth. Furthermore, we will continue to improve 
our expertise in credit review by adopting a comprehensive training 
program for fostering next-generation credit review specialists.Research on Reunification Finance
After years of frosty relations with North Korea, brought on by the 
North’s development of nuclear arms, inter-Korean relationships 
quickly turned sunnier in 2018, with more emphasis on dialogue. 
As a result, the inter-Korean Summit took place in April 2018, and 
the North Korea-United States Singapore Summit was held in the 
following June.KDB has been exploring various ways in which it can expand its role 
in inter-Korean economic cooperation and development finance for 
North Korea. The Bank has also undertaken in-depth economic and 
industrial research on how to promote the development of the North 
Korean economy and facilitate inter-Korean economic cooperation.
In addition, we continue to host the ‘North Korea Policy Forum’, 
collecting opinions of experts in every field regarding inter-Korean 
relationships and unification.In 2019, KDB will further strengthen its policy banking role in relation to 
inter-Korean economic cooperation and development finance in North 
Korea, in support of the ‘New Economic Map of the Korean Peninsula’ 
and other government policies. In addition, KDB will fulfill its role as 
Korea’s leading policy bank by developing new ways to cooperate 
with domestic financial institutions and global organizations, in 
anticipation of a revival of inter-Korean economic cooperation.034Ethical ManagementDriven by a strict sense of ethics and a 
commitment to ensuring protection for our 
customers and other stakeholders, everyone  
at KDB puts ethical management at the center 
of its corporate culture.Compliance
REVIEW  OF  2018        KDB  practices  ethical  management  by 
continuously  realigning  its  anti-corruption  infrastructure  and 
running a wide range of programs to promote its code of conduct. 
Effective training on ethics for employees is provided to boost 
ethical awareness, and a culture of ethical management has taken 
root to cultivate a transparent and fair workplace.In 2018, the Korean government set out stricter requirements for 
the public sector to restore integrity and comply with high ethical 
standards that meet the expectations of the general public. Against 
this backdrop, KDB stepped up the following efforts.Firstly, we further improved our infrastructure for anti-corruption and 
integrity. Our Code of Conduct was significantly improved through 
a BOD resolution, and the scope of the Executive Pledge of Ethics, 
which was previously taken only by the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, 
and Auditor, was expanded to include Executive Directors in order 
to increase the sense of responsibility and integrity of the top 
management.Secondly, KDB expanded its anti-corruption and integrity programs 
to  spread  a  culture  of  integrity.  Each  department  undertook 
voluntary integrity implementation and participated in a bank-wide 
contest for integrity policy suggestion. Moreover, branches and 
employees with high ethical performance were awarded.Lastly, in accordance with strengthened anti-money laundering 
supervision standards, KDB has implemented relevant measures, 
such as more detailed ‘know your customer (KYC)’ due diligence 
and stricter rules on Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STR). We 
have also improved our abilities to counter cryptocurrency money 
laundering, and reviewed anti-money laundering systems at our 
overseas branches. Moreover, in response to the resumption of 
U.S. sanctions on Iran and strengthened sanctions on North Korea 
in 2018, we have thoroughly implemented the sanctions into our 
everyday business for full compliance.PLANS FOR 2019    The key target for ethical management in 
2019 will be strengthening the control of anti-corruption and 
integrity functions. Firstly, we will make overhauls to KDB’s integrity 
infrastructure and provide exemplary best practices. For example, 
we plan to make improvements to internal regulations, namely 
the Code of Conduct, and provide integrity manuals by each job 
function.Secondly, we plan to adopt an anonymous reporting system that 
will expose any corrupt activities and improve our self-purification 
capabilities. The system will guarantee reporters’ anonymity and 
enhance the overall effectiveness of our anti-corruption system.Lastly, KDB will also make substantial improvements to its anti-
money  laundering  systems,  while  actively  responding  to  the 
compliance assessment by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), 
which is scheduled to take place in 2019.Consumer Protection
REVIEW  OF  2018        KDB  continuously  strives  to  improve  its 
consumer protection systems based on its core value of protecting 
the rights of financial consumers, which is especially important 
given the recent trend in Korea towards strengthened protection for 
financial consumers.KDB has established a consumer protection process for each phase 
of the life of a financial product from development to sales and 
post-sales. We regularly examine across all phases for any factor 
that may impinge on consumer rights in order to prevent improper 
or incomplete product sales. The product development and sales 
departments co-operate by sharing information on recent consumer 
protection issues through the Financial Consumer Protection 
Council. As a result of these efforts, KDB earned ‘Excellent’ ratings 
across all categories from the ‘Evaluation of Consumer Protection 
Status’ by the Financial Supervisory Service in 2018.tn

improve customer satisfaction. We have set up an SMS-based 
notification service as part of the complaint handling procedure in 
order to address complaints more promptly, while also striving to 
reduce the number of complaints by analyzing the cause of the most 
frequent complaints, providing training on handling complaints, 
and distributing a checklist for complaints prevention. Moreover, 
we conduct in-house customer satisfaction surveys to enhance 
employee  awareness,  thereby  improving  levels  of  consumer 
satisfaction.KDB makes the utmost effort to protect the personal information 
of its customers. We have established detailed standards for 
the handling of personal information and regularly check on the 
implementation of these standards. As a result, KDB earned an 
‘Excellent’ rating from the assessment of its personal information 
protection system by the Ministry of the Interior and Safety in 2018. 
We also operate electronic financial fraud prevention and monitoring 
systems to protect consumers from voice phishing.0362018 Milestones and performance for consumer protectionMilestonesPerformanceEstablished a consumer

ManagementKDB seeks to recruit forward-looking global 
talent driven by passion and determination, 
and also possessing the qualifications 
and sense of ethics needed to lead the 
development of the Korean financial industry.Fair and Competency-driven Recruitment
KDB hires new employees every year in order to respond effectively 
to the ever-changing economic and business environments, and 
to strengthen its organizational competencies. We ensure equal 
opportunity and fairness in our recruitment process by adopting 
‘blind recruitment’ practices. Recruitment is driven above all by 
job competencies, with an emphasis on a candidate’s basic 
capabilities and organizational fit within the financial industry.KDB hired 63 new employees in 2018, all of whom had undergone 
a multi-dimensional evaluation at each stage of the hiring process 
in line with National Competency Standards (NCS). We significantly 
increased the proportion of new employees with technological 
background, including big data, ICT, and biotech. These talented 
new recruits will take the lead in shaping the future of Korean 
industries in the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution.Strengthening Job Competencies
We segment job functions at KDB into 172 categories with the aim 
of maximizing organizational competencies through enhancement 
of individual job competencies. We support employees in their 
individual development through a wide range of personalized 
Career Development Programs (CDPs) which are divided into 
exploration, development, and master phases. Employees in the 
exploration phase can improve their skills in their own job functions 
while also gaining experience within other areas. Subsequently, 
more support is given to employees to help them further develop 
their expertise as they move towards the master phase.For specialized job positions requiring higher level of expertise, 
positions are filled through competitive in-house recruitment 
process. In 2018, we recruited staff for positions in project finance, 
regional  development,  shipping  and  aviation  finance,  credit 
review, risk management, and industry analysis & assessment. 
We also operate an open position system which emphasizes the 
importance of expertise, and imbues our organizational culture with 
added vitality. In 2018, we proceeded with in-house and external 
recruitment to hire qualified experts in three areas — retirement 
pension consulting, management strategy, and bancassurance & 
fund sales — and thus continued our efforts to secure experts in 
each area.Programs for Development of Global Talent 
KDB offers its employees a wide array of opportunities to develop 
their expertise and pursue knowledge in their own specific areas 
of interest. The Bank’s career development roadmap consists of 
three-phase training courses for each of its 24 job functions, and 
a variety of in-house training courses are offered covering key 
areas including loans, deposits, and F/X transactions. In addition, 
we enable our employees to continue their education anytime and 
anywhere by providing online courses through the KDB e-Campus, 
in partnership with professional training institutions.KDB also runs a range of overseas programs aimed at developing 
global  talent.  We  offer  training  programs  to  nurture  regional 
specialists in countries with strong growth potential such as 
Indonesia and Vietnam, where we are seeking future business 
opportunities. Moreover, employees are dispatched to overseas 
networks in New York, London, and Singapore for on-the-job 
training and are offerred a variety of foreign language training 
courses before and after work.038Corporate Social 
ResponsibilityAll members of KDB are aware of their 
responsibility in contributing to the 
sustainable growth of local communities, 
and strive to make a positive difference to 
society through social contribution activities.ig

K038Case 1.Case 3.Climate Change Project  
Development SeminarKorea’s first green bond 
(in KRW)Leveraging the experience gained in 2017 by issuing a 
foreign currency-denominated green bond, KDB issued 
Korea’s first KRW-denominated green bond, worth KRW 
300  billion  with  3-year  maturity  at  an  annual  coupon 
of 2.35%, in May 2018, targeting institutional investors 
interested in socially responsible investment (SRI). KDB 
allocated 5.3% of the net proceeds to solar power projects 
and 94.7% to double track railway projects. Except for one 
project still under construction (expected to be complete 
by December 2024), all funded projects are currently in 
operation. Once all the projects are operating, the total 
reduction in CO2 emissions is expected to be 201,515 
tons per annum, of which, given KDB’s participation, our 
contribution will be an annual 16,589 tons, or 528 tons per 
KRW 1 billion of proceeds (details in the table below). The 
issuance of a KRW-denominated green bond is expected 
to increase interest in SRI in the domestic market, and will 
promote green finance by attracting financial resources 
much-needed to counter climate change.KDB addressed the climate change issue by hosting 
the Climate Change Project Development Seminar (co-
hosted by KDB and KEPCO) in March 2018, and invited a 
number of climate change-related companies, including 
KEPCO and academic experts. At the Seminar, we shared 
information on KDB’s roles as an Implementing Entity of 
Green Climate Fund (GCF). Following up on this seminar, 
we will build a system of seamless cooperation with both 
major climate change project participants and academic 
experts, and actively facilitate more KDB-GCF co-financing 
projects.Case 2.KDB Climate Finance Forum 2018KDB hosted the KDB Climate Finance Forum in October 
2018, and invited companies and organizations involved in 
climate change projects, including the Ministry of Economy 
and Finance, GCF, and Hanwha Energy. At the forum, we 
shared detailed information about the measures we have 
put in place to enhance accessibility to GCF funds, and 
our experience in and strategies for implementing climate 
change  projects.  There  was  a  panel  discussion  with 
participation from KDB, KEPCO, and K-SURE to discuss 
how to expand the financial fundamentals for climate 
change projects in developing countries. This forum has 
helped us to build close ties with major climate change 
project stakeholders. Going forward, KDB plans to be 
more active in climate change projects including new and 
renewable energy sector.Environmental impactsSectorSolar powerDouble track railwayTotalEnergy Generation

KlCase 4.Case 5.Korea’s first social bond 
(in KRW)Effective implementation of  
socially responsible financingKDB issued Korea’s first KRW-denominated social bond in 
October 2018, worth KRW 300 billion with 2-year maturity 
at an annual coupon rate of 2.08%. All the proceeds were 
allocated towards creating jobs at 42 companies. The total 
number of employees at these companies went up from 
9,552 at the end of 2016 to 11,846 at the 2017 year-end, an 
increase of 24%. By providing financial support with social 
value, we are encouraging companies to create jobs, thereby 
strengthening  the  foundations  for  continued  corporate 
hiring. The issuance of the KRW-denominated social bond 
will further promote the socially responsible finance market 
in Korea, which remains in its early phase, and will also 
enhance KDB’s reputation as a leading policy bank.Social impactsSectorJobcreationNumber

undertook a range of other projects in 2018 to promote 
socially responsible finance.Sound environmental and social risk management
•  KDB, as the only Equator Principles Financial Institution 
(EPFI) in Korea, recognizes the importance of ensuring that 
the projects we finance are developed in a manner that 
is socially responsible and reflects sound environmental 
management practices. Adopted by the Bank in 2017, the 
Equator Principles (EPs) serve as a baseline and framework 
for determining, assessing, and managing environmental 
and social risk in project-related transactions. We are 
fully committed to implementing the EPs through our 
Environmental and Social (E&S) Review and Management 
Guideline that sets out the Bank’s objectives, standards, and 
procedures for managing environmental and social risks in 
the projects. In 2018, our dedicated E&S team conducted 
internal environmental and social reviews on project finance 
and project-related corporate loan transactions that fell 
within the scope of the Equator Principles.Expansion of the Mutual Growth Fund

KDB family volunteer group   Since 1996, KDB employees 
and their families have been paying regular visits to welfare 
facilities, such as rehab centers, facilities for the hearing 
impaired,  and  orphanages.  The  volunteers  undertake  a 
range of activities that embody their neighborly love including 
quarterly deliveries of much-needed supplies.Support for people living in welfare blind spots    This 
program identifies underprivileged people who are caught in 
welfare support blind spots, and supports them in the spirit of 
neighborly love. KDB provided a wide range of sponsorships 
in 2018, including sponsorships for promising track and field 
athletes and an alternative school.Kimchi sharing   Every year since 2008, KDB and the Seoul 
City Women’s Society have worked together to deliver kimchi  
to neighbors in need, especially elderly people who live alone. 
In November 2018, we delivered 12,000 cabbages of kimchi 
to elderly people living alone, low-income families, and welfare 
facilities.Regular sharing events   In partnership with the Yeongdeungpo 
Senior Welfare Center, KDB visits elderly people living alone to 
deliver rice and other daily necessities, as well as goods needed 
to stay warm during the winter. We also take part in a wide range 
of volunteer activities, including free meals, financial donations, 
special activities on major national holidays, as well as fundraising 
and volunteering activities involving all employees at the end of 
each year.Blood drives   KDB runs blood drives in which all employees 
are encouraged to participate, with the aim of helping pediatric 
patients with leukemia. Participants deliver their blood donation 
certificates and make financial donations to relevant institutions, 
and the Bank matches the donations made.Employee donations   KDB collects the last four-digit portion of 
its employees’ monthly wages, and donates the sum in the form 
of scholarships and support for low-income and single-parent 
households.Education
KDB has provided biannual pro-bono financial education 
programs targeting teenagers. Also, since 1985, we have 
invited children living on remote islands to Seoul to help them 
experience life in the biggest city in Korea.Culture
Our Mecenat activities are focused on bringing culture, arts, 
and sports closer to the public. We invite young people from 
low-income families and disabled teenagers to various cultural 
events, and also provide sponsorships to unpopular culture & 
art performances.Nation
One-Company-for-One-Village & One-Company-for-One-
Platoon campaigns   2018 marks the 13th year of our ‘One-
Company-for-One-Village’ campaign, through which we provide 
medical services, host events to promote the purchase of local 
products, provide a helping hand to farmers, and invite them to 
cultural performances. KDB also runs the ‘One-Company-for-
One-Platoon’ campaign which supports Korean armed forces 
and encourages our employees to experience the importance 
of national security.KDB FoundationEstablished in 2007, the KDB Foundation runs projects 
in three areas — socially responsible finance, community 
service, and talent development. The following projects run 
by the Foundation reflect KDB’s commitment to creating 
social value through sustainable finance.In 2018, a total of 406 teams applied for ‘KDB Start-up 
Program’, a program supporting start-ups run by young 
people, and 25 teams were chosen to participate in the 
final round. They were provided with a range of training 
programs, including professional start-up training, 
mentoring, and venture capital support. 7 teams were  
finally selected to be offered start-up funds totaling  
KRW 200 million, as well as other follow-up programs.‘KDB Microcredit Fund’ helps underprivileged people 
build more stable finances. In 2018, we helped 14 small 
businesses and 4 franchisees start their own businesses. 
In addition to financial support, KDB offered 12 follow-up 
business management programs, such as management 
consulting and one-on-one mentoring.‘KDB Social Economy Enterprise Support Program’ has 
been in place since 2015, with the aim of supporting 
the creation of jobs for the underprivileged. In 2018, 
we provided 10 social enterprises with resources for 
facility investments, as well as customized mentoring on 
marketing, finance, and labor. This program has supported 
a total of 37 social enterprises since its launch, and has

KlKnowledge SharingKDB does its utmost to enable society to move forwardin a more constructive direction by sharing its vastknowledge database accumulated over many years ofexperience with the public.Sharing know-how in policy finance
KDB shares its knowledge of development finance with 
emerging countries, and promotes friendly international 
relations.  Therefore,  in  response  to  a  request  made  by 
the World Bank, in May 2018, we shared our know-how in 
policy finance for new growth industries and experience as 
a GCF Implementing Entity with public officials from Laos. 
This was followed by training for employees of the National 
Bank  of  Cambodia  in  August,  and  public  officials  from 
Indonesia in September. In November, we provided training 
on development finance and risk management to employees 
of the State Bank of Vietnam and VietinBank. We also invited 
employees of the central banks of Thailand, Myanmar, and 
Vietnam to visit KDB in December, and explained KDB’s roles 
and functions in policy finance.In July 2018, KDB provided training regarding the public-
private partnership (PPP) projects in Korea to the officials of 
Indonesia’s Ministry of Finance, as part of the Knowledge 
Sharing  Program  (KSP)  organized  by  the  Ministry  of 
Economy and Finance and in order to support the Korean 
government’s cooperation with developing countries. KDBalso invited foreign students at the KAIST Graduate School 
of Finance in November and explained KDB’s roles and 
functions, as part of a program organized by KOICA to help 
public officials from developing countries become financial 
experts.Developing global talent
In July 2018, KDB Foundation invited 33 ethnic Korean 
university students from four countries in Central Asia to join 
the ‘KDB Global Leadership Program’. Aimed at fostering the 
next-generation leaders in Central Asia, this customized six-
week training program consisted of Korean language and 
history courses, cultural experiences, leadership training, and 
a tour of Seoul.KDB will continue to support next-generation ethnic Korean 
leaders who can be a bridge between two countries. A total 
of 221 graduates have been generated from this program 
since its launch in 2012, and approximately 60 of them have 
been admitted to prestigious graduate schools in Korea, 
hired by multinational corporations, or become public officials 
in Central Asia.T

REVIEW041041Management’s Discussion & AnalysisThe 2018 financial statements prepared by KDB conform to the Korean International Financial Reporting Standards (K-IFRS). K-IFRS refers to 
Korea’s adoption of the standards and interpretations released by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The 2018 financial 
statements of KDB cover financial performance from January 1 to December 31 of the year, and the financial figures in this Management’s 
Discussion & Analysis (MD&A), unless specified otherwise, are based on consolidated financial statements.2018 Review 
The global economy sustained a moderate growth but concerns over a slowdown mounted on unstable economic conditions in emerging 
markets influenced by the US interest rate hikes, looming risks from the US-China trade disputes, Brexit and other factors.The Korean economy likewise experienced slower growth with decreased growth in manufacturing, moderate improvements in services and 
continued sluggishness in construction. The nominal growth rate remains below the recent trend and the GDI growth rate is fastly receding on 
deteriorating terms of trade. Domestic demand was stagnant with weaker investment and slower consumption growth. The Korean financial 
industry, however, was able to maintain sound levels of profitability and asset quality, despite the global economic downturn and increasing 
household debts in Korea.According to our survey, facilities investment showed a continuous trend of investment concentration in semiconductors and displays. Following 
recent industry trends, the change in external and internal industrial structure is having a greater impact, encouraging the embracement of new 
technology. Despite growing corporate awareness of the need for investments in the 4th Industrial Revolution-related fields, actual corporate 
investments are still insufficient.KDB has concentrated more of its competencies on future growth industries and industries associated with the 4th Industrial Revolution to 
ensure the stability and revitalization of the national economy as Korea’s representative financial institution. KDB also encouraged preemptive 
restructuring for corporate groups suffering from a temporary shortage in liquidity and took effective financial measures to prevent a potential 
contagion of crisis.Our continued efforts also include promoting overseas advancement of Korean companies, fostering a healthy start-up ecosystem, contributing 
to the competencies of SMEs, and marking grounds for a Global KDB through providing financial arrangements in overseas PF market and 
establishing the Asia Regional Head Office in Singapore as the business hub in Southeast Asia.KDB’s prestige as a market leader and Korea’s representative financial institution, together with its impressive capital adequacy, has been 
comprehensively evaluated by international credit rating agencies. In 2018, KDB maintained high credit ratings (Moody’s Aa2, S&P AA, and 
Fitch AA-), and its BIS capital ratio stood at 14.80 percent.2019 Outlook
Reflecting a confluence of factors affecting major economies, the global growth is projected to slow from 3.6 percent in 2018 to 3.3 percent in 
2019 according to IMF World Economic Outlook (April 2019). However, the gaps among the growth rates of advanced economies are widening 
and the financial markets in some emerging countries are showing signs of instability, escalating uncertainties over global growth.Korea is projected to grow 2.6 percent in 2019, an inch down from 2018 (2.7 percent), according to IMF and KDI, as export growth moderates 
and domestic demand slows. Facilities investment will continue to see slow growth in 2019, as the unprecedented huge investment in 
semiconductors is expected to subside and investment demand in other sectors will be marginal. Growth in the Korean economy will be limited 
by weaker private consumption and slower growth in exports as a result of delays in the economic recovery of major trading partners.In addition, risks will persist on the backdrop of a worsening trade environment caused by global economic downturn, increasing trade 
protectionism, and the ongoing Brexit issue. The lackluster growth of the global economy and trade volume, falling unit prices of major 
export items and weakening global competitiveness could become downside risks to growth projections. Internally, there are still risk factors 
concerning increasing amounts of non-performing loans caused by deteriorating conditions in the global and domestic economy, and high 
household debts — albeit the recent slowed growth in household debts.KDB plans to fulfill its role by strengthening its fundamentals at a time when the volatility of domestic and international economic situation is 
increasing. KDB will spearhead the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution, reinvigorating the national economy as well as raising monitoring efforts 
on the global and domestic capital markets, while also providing a market safety net.In 2019, KDB will strive to carry out its role based on stable credit ratings, globally competitive financial expertise, and thorough risk 
management, in the face of a rapidly changing financial environment. Moreover, KDB will facilitate a rebound of the national economy by taking 
the lead in advancing the financial industry as well as backing the push for globalization.T

a decrease in other assets, which fell by 15.4% to KRW 30,998 billion.KDB’s liabilities went down by 1.9% year on year to record KRW 225,823 billion, which is mainly attributable to reduction in borrowings and

As a result, KDB’s total equity stood at KRW 34,253 billion, up 2.0% from the previous year, due to aforementioned increase in issued capital, 
and increases in retained earnings and non-controlling interests.T

K046Independent Auditors’ ReportBased on a report originally issued in KoreanThe Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Korea Development BankOpinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of 
Korea Development Bank and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”), 
which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as 
of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the consolidated statements of 
comprehensive income, consolidated statements of changes in equity 
and consolidated statements of cash flows for the years then ended, 
and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant 
accounting policies.In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position 
of the Group as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and its consolidated 
financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the years then 
ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the Republic of Korea (Korea IFRS).Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Korean Standards on 
Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described 
in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statement section of our report. We are independent of the Group in 
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the consolidated financial statements in the Republic of Korea, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.Other Matter
Auditing standards and their application in practice vary among counties. 
The procedures and practices used in the Republic of Korea to audit 
such financial statements may differ from those generally accepted and 
applied in other countries.Responsibilities of Management and Those with Governance for 
the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of 
the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Korean IFRS, 
and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due fraud or error.In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is 
responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either 
intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations.Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the 
Group’s financial reporting process.Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with  Korean  Statements  on  Auditing  will  always  detect  a  materialmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing, 
we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:•   Identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the 
consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.•   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit 
in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.•   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management.•   Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going 
concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based  on  the  audit  evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to 
cease to continue as a going concern.•   Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the 
consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.•   Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  financial 
information of the entities or business activities within the Group to 
express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among 
other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.Seoul, Korea
March 28, 2019This report is effective as of March 28, 2019, the audit report date. Certain subsequent 
events or circumstances, which may occur between the audit report date and the 
time of reading this report, could have a material impact on the accompanying 
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Accordingly, the readers of 
the audit report should understand that there is a possibility that the above audit 
report may have to be revised to reflect the impact of such subsequent events or 
circumstances, if any.ils

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Korean International Financial Reporting Standards 
(K-IFRS) enacted by the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies.(2) Changes and disclosures of accounting policies(i) New and amended standards and interpretations adopted
The Group newly applied the following amended and enacted standards for the annual period beginning on January 1, 2018. The nature 
and the impact of each new standard or amendment are described below:K-IFRS 1109 ‘Financial Instruments’
K-IFRS 1109 ‘Financial Instruments’ replaces the existing guidance in K-IFRS 1039 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. 
K-IFRS 1109 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments project: classification and measurement, impairment 
and hedge accounting. Also, KIFRS 1107 Financial Instruments: Disclosures has been amended in accordance with K-IFRS 1109.The Group’s accounting policies have been changed and the amounts recognized in the financial statements have been modified as a 
result of the adoption of KIFRS 1109 on January 1, 2018. In accordance with the transitional provisions, the financial statements for the 
year ended December 31, 2017 have not been restated.The main features of the standard include: a business model for the managing financial assets; classification and measurement of 
financial assets based on contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets; an impairment model for financial instruments based on 
expected credit losses; the hedged item that meet the requirements of hedge accounting, increases in hedging instruments, or changes in 
the evaluation method for hedge effectiveness.Classification and measurement of financial assets
K-IFRS  1109  requires  a  financial  asset  to  be  classified  and  measured  subsequently  at  amortized  cost,  fair  value  through  other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI), or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) based on the holder’s business model and instrument’s 
contractual cash flow characteristics as shown below. If a hybrid contract contains a host that is a financial asset, an embedded derivative 
is not separated from the host and the entire hybrid contract is classified according to the requirement of K-IFRS 1109.Business modelComposed solely of principal and interestOtherContractual cash flow characteristicsObjective of collecting contractual cash flows

selling financial assets

(*2) Investments in equity instruments not held for trading may be irrevocably designated as measured at FVOCI.061061Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017Classification and measurement of financial liabilities
K-IFRS 1109 requires that the amount of change in fair value of the financial liability designated as measured at FVTPL that is attributable 
to changes in the credit risk shall be presented in other comprehensive income and the amount shall not be reclassified as profit or loss. 
If the requirements create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss, all gains or losses on that liability including the effects of 
changes in the credit risk shall be presented in profit or loss.Impairment: financial assets and contract assets
In K-IFRS 1109, impairment of debt instruments measured at amortized costs or FVOCI, lease receivables, contract assets, loan 
commitments and financial guarantee contracts is recognized based on the expected credit loss (ECL) impairment model.K-IFRS 1109 outlines a ‘three-stage’ model for impairment based on changes in credit risk since initial recognition. A loss allowance is 
measured based on the 12-month ECL or life-time ECL which allows early recognition of credit loss compared to the incurred loss model 
of K-IFRS 1039.ClassificationLoss allowanceStage 1Stage 2Stage 3Assets with no significant increase in credit 
risk since initial recognition
Assets with significant increase in credit risk 
since initial recognition
Credit-impaired assets12-month ECL: Expected credit losses that result from default events 
that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.Lifetime ECL: Expected credit losses that result from all possible default 
events over the expected life of the financial instrument.In K-IFRS 1109, the cumulative changes in lifetime ECL since initial recognition are recognized as a loss allowance for originated credit-
impaired financial assets.Hedge accounting
K-IFRS 1109 maintains mechanics of hedge accounting (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge and a hedge of a net investment in a foreign 
operation) as set forth in K-IFRS 1039. However, unlike requirements in K-IFRS 1039 that are too complex and strict, K-IFRS 1109 is more 
practical, principle based and less strict and focuses on the entity’s risk management activities. Also, K-IFRS 1109 allows broader range of 
hedged items and hedging instruments. Under K-IFRS 1039, a hedge is assessed to be highly effective only if the offset is in the range of 
80-125 percentage by performing numerical test of effectiveness. In K-IFRS 1109, such requirements are alleviated.For details about impacts of the adoption of the K-IFRS 1109, see Note 63.K-IFRS 1115 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
K-IFRS 1115 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ replaces the existing guidance in K-IFRS 1011 ‘Construction Contracts’, K-IFRS 
1018 ‘Revenue’, K-IFRS 2113 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’, K-IFRS 2115 ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’, K-IFRS 2118 
‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’ and K-IFRS 2031 ‘Revenue - Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services’. The Group applied 
K-IFRS 1115 to the annual period beginning January 1, 2018 and recognized the cumulative impact of initially applying the standard as an 
adjustment to retained earnings as at January 1, 2018, the period of initial application.Under the new K-IFRS 1115, revenue is recognized by applying a five-stage revenue recognition model (Identification of a contract with 
a customer  → Identification of performance obligations in the contract  → Determination of the transaction price  → Allocation of the 
transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract → Recognition of revenue upon satisfying the performance 
obligations) to all of its contracts with customers.For details about impacts of the adoption of the K-IFRS 1115, see Note 63.K-IFRS 1028 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’
When an investment in an associate or a joint venture is held by, or it held indirectly through, an entity that is a venture capital organization, 
a mutual fund, etc., the entity may elect to measure that investment at fair value through profit or loss. The amendments clarify that an 
entity shall make this election separately for each associate of joint venture, at initial recognition of the associate or joint venture. The 
adoption of K-IFRS 1028 has no significant impact on the financial statements of the Group.K-IFRS 1102 ‘Share-based Payment’
Amendment to K-IFRS 1102 clarifies the accounting for a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes 
the classification of the transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled and valuation method used to measure fair value of cash-settled 
share-based payment. The adoption of K-IFRS 1102 has no significant impact on the financial statements of the Group.062062Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017Enactments to Interpretation 2122‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration’
According to these enactments ‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration’, the date of the transaction for determining 
the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it) is the date on which an entity initially 
recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration. If there are 
multiple payments or receipts in advance, the entity shall determine a date of the transaction for each payment or receipt of advance 
consideration. The adoption of enactments to Interpretation 2122 has no significant impact on the financial statements of the Group.(ii) New standards and interpretations issued but not effectiveThe following new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been issued but not effective for annual periods 
beginning after January 1, 2018, and the Group has not early adopted them. The Group is currently in progress of analyzing the potential 
impact on the financial statements resulting from the application of these standards, interpretations and amendments.K-IFRS 1116 ‘Leases’
K-IFRS 1116 ‘Leases’ will replace K-IFRS 1017 ‘Leases’, Interpretation 2104 ‘Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease’, 
Interpretation 2015 ‘Operating Leases-Incentives’, and Interpretation 2027 ‘Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal 
Form of a Lease’. The Group will adopt this standard for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019.At inception of a contract, the Group shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Also, at the date of initial application, the 
Group shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease in accordance with the standard. However, the Group may not need to 
reassess all contracts with applying the practical expedient that can be applied to contracts entered before the date of initial application.For a contract that is, or contains, a lease, the Group shall account for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately 
from non-lease components of the contract. The lessee is required to recognize the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities representing 
the right to occupy the underlying assets and the duty to make lease payments, respectively. However, as the cases of short-term lease 
and the low value assets the exemption is applicable. In addition, as a practical expedient, the lessee may elect, by class of underlying 
asset, not to separate non-lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated 
non-lease components as a single lease component.From a lessor’s accounting perspective, K-IFRS 1116 will not significantly change in comparison to K-IFRS 1017.(a) Accounting for a lessee
A lessee shall apply this standard to its leases either (a) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented applying K-IFRS 1008 
‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’ (Full retrospective application); or (b) with the cumulative effect of 
initially applying the standard being recognized at the date of initial application.The Group plans to apply K-IFRS 1116 retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard and as such will not 
restate any comparative information.The Group performed an impact assessment to identify potential financial effects of applying K-IFRS 1116. The assessment was performed 
based on available information as at January 1, 2019 to identify effects on 2019 financial statements.The total minimum lease payment expected to be paid by the Bank in relation to operating leases before discounted to their present 
value is ₩40,257 million. When the payment is discounted at incremental borrowing rate of the lessee, the total minimum lease payment 
amounts to ₩37,144 million. For the all (or partial) contracts that are, or contain, a lease, the Bank plans to apply the practical expedient to 
account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease componentBased on the impact assessment, the Bank expects the right-of-use asset and a lease liability as at January 1, 2019 to be increased by 
₩46,496 million and  ₩37,132 million, respectively. The results of the assessment in the financial effects may change due to additional 
information that the Group may obtain in the future.(b) Accounting for a lessor
For the lease accounting as the lessor from the Group’s point of view, the Group expects the impact to the financial statements applying 
K-IFRS 1116 will not be significant.Amendments to K-IFRS 1109 ‘Financial Instruments’
The narrow-scope amendments made to K-IFRS 1109 ‘Financial Instruments’ enable entities to measure certain prepayable financial 
assets with negative compensation at amortized cost. When a modification of a financial liability measured at amortized cost that does not 
result in the derecognition, a modification gain or loss shall be recognized in profit or loss. These amendments will be applied for annual 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.063063Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017Amendments to K-IFRS 1019 ‘Employee Benefits’
The amendments require that an entity shall calculate current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the reporting period after a 
plan amendment, curtailment or settlement based on updated actuarial assumptions from the date of the change. The amendments also 
require that a reduction in a surplus must be recognized in profit or loss even if that surplus was not previously recognized because of 
the impact of the asset ceiling. The amendments are effective for plan amendments, curtailments and settlements occurring in reporting 
periods that begin on or after 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted.Amendments to K-IFRS 1028 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’
The amendments clarify that an entity shall apply K-IFRS 1109 to financial instruments in an associate or joint venture to which the equity 
method is not applied. These include long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the entity’s net investment in an associate or 
joint venture. The amendments clarify that an entity shall apply K-IFRS 1109 to other interests in an associate or joint venture to which 
the equity method is not applied. In addition, the entity shall apply the impairment requirements in K-IFRS 1109 first to its other long-term 
interests that, in substance, form part of the entity’s net investment in an associate or joint venture. These amendments will be applied 
retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In accordance with the transitional 
provisions in K-IFRS 1109, the restatement of the comparative information is not required and the cumulative effects of initially applying 
the amendments retrospectively should be recognized in the beginning balance of retained earnings (or other components of equity, as 
appropriate) at the date of initial application.Enactment to Interpretation of K-IFRS 2123 ‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’
The Interpretation explains how to recognize and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty 
over a tax treatment, and includes guidance on how to determine whether each uncertain tax treatment is considered separately or 
together. It also presents examples of circumstances where a judgement or estimate is required to be reassessed. This Interpretation will 
be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and an entity can either restate the 
comparative financial statements retrospectively or recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the Interpretation as an adjustment 
in the beginning balance at the date of initial application.Annual Improvements to K-IFRS 2015 – 2017 Cycle:
The amendments to K-IFRS 1103 ‘Business Combination’ clarify that when a party to a joint arrangement obtains control of a business 
that is a joint operation, and had rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to that joint operation immediately before 
the acquisition date, the transaction is a business combination achieved in stages. And amendments to K-IFRS 1111 ‘Joint Agreements’, 
K-IFRS 1012 ‘Income Tax’ and K-IFRS 1023 ‘Borrowing Costs’ have been issued.(3) Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following material items in the 
consolidated statement of financial position:- Derivative financial instruments measured at fair value
- Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss 
- Available-for-sale financial instruments measured at fair value
- Fair value hedged financial instruments with changes in fair value, due to hedged risks, recognized in profit or loss 
-  Liabilities for defined benefit plans, which are recognized as net of the total present value of defined benefit obligations less the fair value 
of plan assets064064Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017(4) Functional and presentation currency
In preparing the Group’s consolidated financial statements, transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group entities 
at their respective functional currency rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. The Group’s consolidated financial statements are 
presented in Korean won, which is also the Group’s functional currency. The following entities of the Group have different functional 
currency from the presentation currency:Functional currencySubsidiariesKDB Asia Ltd.KDB Ireland Ltd.KDB Asia Private Equity FundKDB-IAP OBOR Private Equity FundMulti-Asset KDB Shipping Private Fund SPO-1Multi-Asset KDB Shipping Private Fund SNT-1Multi-Asset KDB Shipping Private Fund DA-3Multi-Asset KDB Shipping Private Fund KLC-1Multi-Asset KDB Ocean Value-up Private Fund 5thMulti-Asset KDB Ocean Value-up Private Fund 6thKDB Bank Uzbekistan Ltd.KDB Bank Europe Ltd.Banco KDB Do Brazil S. A.USDUZSHUFBRL(5) Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with K-IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Management’s estimates may differ from actual outcomes if management’s estimates and assumptions based on management’s best 
judgment at the reporting date are different from the actual environment.Estimates and underlying assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period 
in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.The following are the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting 
period that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year:(i) Fair value of financial instruments
Financial instruments held-for-trading, financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial 
assets and derivative instruments are recognized and measured at fair value. If the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair 
value is determined either by using a valuation technique or independent third-party valuation service. Valuation techniques include using 
recent arm’s length market transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, if available, referencing to the current fair value of another 
instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.Financial instruments, which are not actively traded in the market and those with less transparent market prices, will have less objective 
fair values and require broad judgment on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty in market factors and assumptions in price determination 
and other risks. Diverse valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, from generally accepted market 
valuation models to internally developed valuation models that incorporate various types of assumptions and variables.(ii) Provisions for credit losses (allowances for loan losses, provisions for payment guarantee, and unused commitments)
The Group tests impairment and recognizes allowances for losses on financial assets classified at amortized cost, debt instruments 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and recognizes provisions for guarantees, and unused loan commitments. 
Accuracy of provisions for credit losses is dependent upon estimation of expected cash flows of the borrower for individually assessed 
allowances of loans, and upon assumptions and methodology used for collectively assessed allowances for groups of loans, guarantees 
and unused loan commitments.065065Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017(iii) Deferred taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realized or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred 
income tax assets are recognized to the extent that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to 
be utilized. Actual income taxes in the future may not be identical to the recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities,(iv) Defined benefit liabilities
The Group operates a defined benefit plan. Defined benefit liability is calculated by annual actuarial valuations as of the reporting date. In 
order to perform the actuarial valuations, assumptions for discount rates, future salary increases and others are required to be estimated. 
Defined benefit plans contain significant uncertainties in estimations due to its long-term nature.(6) Approval date for the consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on March 28, 2019, which will be submitted for 
approval to the shareholders’ meeting to be held on March 29, 2019.3.  Significant Accounting PoliciesThe significant accounting policies applied by the Group in preparation of its consolidated financial statements are included below. The 
accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.(1) Basis of consolidation(i) Subsidiaries and business combinations
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has right to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power of the entity. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which 
controls ceases.If a subsidiary of the Group uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions 
and events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to its financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements.For acquisitions meeting the definition of a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting is used. Identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition 
date. Any goodwill arising from initial consolidation is tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the need for impairment. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, 
measured at acquisition date in fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed and the 
amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquire. Costs related to acquisition are recognized as expenses when occurred.The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognized directly in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.Intra-group balances, income and expenses, unrealized gain and loss and dividends resulting from intra-group transactions are fully 
eliminated. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a change of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the 
Group loses control over a subsidiary, it recognizes any investment retained at fair value and any surplus or deficit in profit or loss.(ii) Investments in associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the 
Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power. Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
and are initially recognized at cost. The Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill (net of any accumulated impairment loss) 
identified on acquisition. When the investors’ share on the fair value of the associates’ identifiable assets and liabilities exceeds acquisition 
cost of the associates’ interest, the excess portion is recognized as the current profit for the year of acquisition.066066Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or loss is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income, and its 
share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognized in reserves. When the Group’s share of loss in an associate equals or 
exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognize further loss, unless it has 
incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associates. The carrying amount of equity method investments and the long-
term interest that partially consists of investors’ net investment are included in interest in the associate.  Unrealized gain and loss on 
transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate. Accounting policies 
of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.(iii) Acquisitions from entities under common control
The assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at the carrying amounts recognized previously in the Group controlling shareholder’s 
consolidated financial statements. The difference between cash paid and acquired net assets are recorded in equity.(iv) Non-controlling Interests
Non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are accounted for separately from the parent’s ownership interests in a subsidiary. Each 
component of net profit or loss and other comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the parent and non-controlling interest 
holders, even when the allocation reduces the non-controlling interests balance below zero.(v) Changes in the parent company’s ownership interest 
Changes in the parent company’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity 
transactions with owners in their capacity as owners. Adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the 
net assets of the subsidiary. The difference between the consideration and the adjustments made to non-controlling interests is recognized 
directly in equity attributable to the owners of the parent company.(2) Operating segments
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. Segment results that 
are reported to the chief operating decision maker include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated 
on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items mainly comprise corporate assets (primarily the Group’s headquarters), head office expenses, 
and income tax assets and liabilities. The Group recognizes the CEO as the chief operating decision maker.(3) Foreign exchange(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of company entities at exchange rates at the dates of the 
transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional 
currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair 
value are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognized in profit or loss, except for differences arising on the translation of 
available for sale equity instruments, a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, or in a 
qualifying cash flow hedge, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. Exchange rate effect of the gain (or loss) from non-
monetary item is categorized according to whether the gain (or loss) is recognized as other comprehensive income or as profit or loss.(ii) Foreign operations
If the presentation currency of the Group is different from a foreign operation’s functional currency, the financial statements of the foreign 
operation are translated into the presentation currency using the following methods:Unless the functional currency of foreign operations is in a state of hyperinflation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated 
at the closing exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses on the statement of comprehensive income are 
translated at the exchange rates of the date of transaction. Foreign currency differences that arise from translation are recognized as other 
comprehensive income.Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation, and any adjustments in fair value to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities due to such acquisition, are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation. Therefore, such are expressed in the 
functional currency of the foreign operations and, alongside other assets and liabilities of the foreign operation, translated at the closing 
exchange rate.067067Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017In the case of the disposal of a foreign operation, cumulative amounts of exchange difference regarding the foreign operation, recognized 
separately from other comprehensive income, are re-categorized from assets to profit or loss as of the moment the disposal profit or loss 
is recognized.(iii) Foreign exchange of net investment in foreign operations
Monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, with none or little possibility of being settled in the foreseeable future, 
are considered a part of the net investment in the foreign operation. Therefore, the exchange difference is recognized as comprehensive 
income or loss in the consolidated financial statement, and re-categorized to profit or loss as of the disposal of the related net investment.(4) Recognition and measurement of financial instruments(i) Initial recognition
The Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets is recognized and derecognized using trade 
date accounting.The Group classifies financial assets as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, or financial assets at amortized cost on the basis of the Group’s business model for managing the financial 
assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. The Group classifies financial liabilities as financial liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss, or financial liabilities at amortized cost.At initial recognition, a financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or 
financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the 
financial asset or financial liability.(ii) Subsequent measurement
After initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at amortized cost or fair value based on classification at initial recognition.Amortized cost
The amortized cost is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus the principal 
repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount 
and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance.Fair value
Fair values, which the Group primarily uses for the measurement of financial instruments, are the published price quotations based on 
market prices or dealer price quotations of financial instruments traded in an active market where available. These are the best evidence 
of fair value. A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from 
an exchange, dealer, broker, an entity in the same industry, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and 
regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis.If the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is determined either by using a valuation technique or independent third-party 
valuation service. Valuation techniques include using recent arm’s length market transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, 
if available, referencing to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and 
option pricing models.The Group uses valuation models that are commonly used by market participants and customized for the Group to determine fair values 
of common over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives such as options, interest rate swaps and currency swaps which are based on the inputs 
observable in markets. For more complex instruments, the Group uses internally developed models, which are usually based on valuation 
methods and techniques generally used within the industry, or a value measured by an independent external valuation institution as the 
fair values if all or some of the inputs to the valuation models are not market observable and therefore it is necessary to estimate fair value 
based on certain assumptions.If the valuation technique does not reflect all factors which market participants would consider in setting a price, the fair value is adjusted 
to reflect those factors. Those factors include counterparty credit risk, bid-ask spread, liquidity risk and others.The chosen valuation technique makes maximum use of market inputs and relies as little as possible on entity-specific inputs. It 
incorporates all factors that market participants would consider in setting a price and is consistent with economic methodologies applied 
for pricing financial instruments. Periodically, the Group calibrates the valuation technique and tests its validity using prices of observable 
current market transactions of the same instrument or based on other relevant observable market data.068068Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017(iii) Derecognition
Derecognition is the removal of a previously recognized financial asset or financial liability from the statement of financial position. The 
Group derecognizes a financial asset or a financial liability when, and only when:Derecognition of financial assets
Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or the financial assets 
have been transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are also transferred, or all the risks 
and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are neither substantially transferred nor retained and the Group has not retained control. If 
the Group neither transfers nor disposes of substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets, the Group continues 
to recognize the financial asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the financial asset.If the Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but retains substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset in its entirety and recognize a financial 
liability for the consideration received.Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognized from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, 
cancelled or expires.(iv) Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statements of financial position where there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the assets and settle the 
liability simultaneously.(5) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with original maturities of or less than three months’ maturity from the date of acquisition 
that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, including cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other 
highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less.(6) Non-derivative financial assets(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Any non-derivative financial asset classified as held for trading or not classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income or financial assets measured at amortized cost is categorized under financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.The Group may designate certain financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss when the designation 
eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as ‘an accounting mismatch’) that 
would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on different bases.After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is measured at fair value and gains or losses arising from a 
change in the fair value are recognized in profit or loss. Interest income and dividend income from financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss are also recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.(ii) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
The Group classifies financial assets as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income if they meet the following 
conditions: 1) debt instruments that are a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling financial assets, and consistent with representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding or 
2) equity instruments, not held for trading with the objective of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealer’s margin, 
designated as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income is measured at fair value. Gain and loss from 
changes in fair value, other than dividend income and interest income amortized using effective interest method and exchange differences 
arising on monetary items which are recognized directly in income as interest income or expense, are recognized as other comprehensive 
income in equity.069069Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017At disposal of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, cumulative gain or loss is recognized as profit or loss for 
the reporting period. However, cumulative gain or loss of equity instrument designated as fair value through other comprehensive income 
are not recycled to profit or loss at disposal. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences resulting from changes in amortized cost are recognized in profit or 
loss, and other changes are recognized as equity.(iii) Financial assets measured at amortized cost
A financial asset, which are held within the business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and 
consistent with representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are classified as a financial 
asset at amortized cost. Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method after initial recognition and interest income is recognized using the effective interest method.(7) Expected Credit Loss of Financial Assets
The Group measures expected credit loss and recognizes loss allowance at the end of the reporting period for financial assets measured 
at amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income with the exception of financial asset measured at fair value through 
profit or loss.The expected credit loss (“ECL”) is the weighted average amount of possible outcomes within a certain range, reflecting the time value of 
money, estimates on the past, current and future situations, and information accessible without excessive cost of effort.The Group uses the following three measurement techniques in accordance with K-IFRS:- General approach: for financial assets and off-balance-sheet unused credit line that are not applied below two approaches
- Simplified approach: for receivables, contract assets and lease receivables
- Credit-impaired approach: for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assetsThe general approach is applied differently depending on the significance of the increase of the credit risk. If, at the reporting date, the 
credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, an entity shall measure the loss allowance for 
that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses. If the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased 
significantly since initial recognition, an entity shall measure the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime 
expected credit losses at each reporting date.The Group applies the simplified approach to 1) trade receivables and contract assets that do not have a significant financing component 
or 2) trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables upon determining the Group’s accounting policies as the application of the 
simplified approach. The approach requires expected lifetime losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the financial assets. Under 
credit-impaired approach, the Group shall only recognize the cumulative changes in lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition 
as a loss allowance for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets.The following non-exhaustive list of information may be relevant in assessing changes in credit risk:
- Significant changes in internal price indicators of credit risk as a result of a change in credit risk since inception
-  Other changes in the rates or terms of an existing financial instrument that would be significantly different if the instrument was newly 
originated or issued at the reporting date
- An actual or expected significant change in the financial instrument’s external credit rating.
-  An actual or expected internal credit rating downgrade for the borrower or decrease in behavioural scoring used to assess credit risk 
internally
- An actual or expected significant change in the operating results of the borrower
- Past due information(i) Forward-looking information
The Group uses forward-looking information, when it determines whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition 
and measures expected credit losses.The Group assumes the risk component has a certain correlation with the business cycle, and calculates the expected credit loss by 
reflecting the forward-looking information with macroeconomic variables on the measurement inputs.Forward looking information used in calculation of expected credit loss is derived after comprehensive consideration of a variety of factors 
including scenario in management planning, worst-case scenario used for stress testing, third party forecast, and others.070070Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017(ii) Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at amortized cost
The amount of the loss on financial assets at amortized cost is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and 
the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The Group estimates 
expected future cash flows for financial assets that are individually significant (individual assessment of impairment).For financial assets that are not individually significant, the Group collectively estimates expected credit loss by grouping loans with 
homogeneous credit risk profile (collective assessment of impairment).Individual assessment of impairment
Individual assessment of impairment losses are calculated using management’s best estimate on present value of expected future 
cashflows. The Group uses all the available information including operating cash flow of the borrower and net realizable value of any 
collateral held.Collective assessment of impairment
Collective assessment of loss allowance involves historical loss experience along with incorporation of forward-looking information. Such 
process incorporates factors such as type of collateral, product and borrowers, credit rating, size of portfolio and recovery period and 
applies probability of default on a group of assets and loss given default by type of recovery method. Also, the expected credit loss model 
involves certain assumption to determine input based on loss experience and forward-looking information. These models and assumptions 
are periodically reviewed to reduce gap between loss estimate and actual loss experience.The expected credit loss for financial assets measured at amortized cost is recognized as the loss allowance, and when the financial asset 
is determined to be irrecoverable, the carrying amount and loss allowance are decreased. If financial assets previously written off are 
recovered, the loss allowance is increased and the difference is recognized in the current profit or loss.(iii) Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
Measuring method of expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is equal to the method 
of financial assets at amortized cost, except for changes in loss allowances that are recognized as other comprehensive income. Amounts 
recognized in other comprehensive income for sale or repayment of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are 
reclassified to profit or loss.(8) Derivative financial instruments including hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value upon agreement of the contract and re-estimated at fair value 
subsequently. The recognition of profit or loss due to changes in fair value of derivative instruments is as stated below:(i) Hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are accounted differently depending on whether hedge accounting is applied, and therefore, are classified 
into trading purpose derivatives and hedging purpose derivatives.Upon the transaction of hedging purpose derivatives, two different types of hedge accounting are applied; a fair value hedge, and a cash 
flow hedge. A fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm 
commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect 
profit or loss. A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that (i) is attributable to a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability (such as all or some future interest payments on variable rate debt) or a highly probable forecast 
transaction and (ii) could affect profit or loss.At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument, including the nature of the risk, the objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, and the method that will be used to 
assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship.Fair value hedge
For designated and qualifying fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of a hedging derivative is recognised in profit or loss in 
the statement of comprehensive income. Meanwhile, the change in the fair value of the hedged item, attributable to the risk hedged, 
is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognised in profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive 
income. When the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship is terminated. For hedged item 
recorded at amortized cost, the difference between the carrying value of the hedged item on termination and the face value is amortized 
over the remaining term of the original hedge using the EIR.071071Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017Cash flow hedge
For designated and qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of gain or loss on the hedging instruments is initially recognised 
directly in equity. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the statement of 
comprehensive income. When the hedged cash flow affects the profit or loss in statement of comprehensive income, the gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument is recorded in the corresponding income or expense line in profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive 
income. When a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time 
remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain and loss that was reported in equity is 
immediately transferred to profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income.Trading purpose derivatives
For trading purpose derivatives transaction, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in net income.(9) Day one profit or loss recognition
For financial instruments classified as level 3 on the fair value level hierarchy measured using assess variables not observable in the 
market, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price, which is equivalent to Day one profit or loss, is 
amortized by using the straight-line method over time.(10) Lease
The classification of leases is based on the extent to which risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased asset lie with the lessor 
and the lessee.(i) Finance lease
Leases of assets where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases, and the Group 
presents them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Also, initial direct cost that includes directly and 
additionally incurred commission fee, legal expenses, and internal accrued costs are included in finance lease receivables. The Group 
accounts for lease payment by apportioning into finance lease receivables and interest revenue, and interest revenue is recognized using 
the EIR method on uncollected finance lease net investment.(ii) Operating lease
A lease is classified as operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership, and the related 
asset is presented as acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation. Moreover, the minimum lease payment excluding guaranteed 
residual value is recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred by lessors in negotiating and 
arranging an operating lease shall be added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized as an expense over the lease term, 
and the depreciation policy for depreciable leased assets shall be consistent with the lessors’ normal depreciation policy for similar assets.(11) Property and equipment
The Group’s property and equipment is recognized at the carrying amount as historical costs less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment in value. Historical costs include the expenditures directly related to the acquisition of assets.Subsequent costs are recognized in the carrying amount of assets or, if appropriate, as separate assets if the probabilities future economic 
benefits associated with the assets will flow into the Group and the costs can be measured reliably; the carrying amount of the replaced 
part is derecognized. Furthermore, any other repairs or maintenances are charged to profit or loss as incurred.Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method to the amount of residual value less 
acquisition cost over the following estimated useful lives:TypeBuildingsStructureLeasehold improvementsVehiclesEquipmentOther propertiesUseful lives (years)12 ~ 6010 ~ 51444 ~ 82 ~ 40072072Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017Property and equipment are impaired when its carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The Group assesses residual value 
and economic life of its assets at each reporting date and makes adjustments to its useful life when necessary. Any gain or loss arising 
from the disposal of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is 
recognized in non-operating income (expense) in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.(12) Investment property
The Group classifies property held for the purpose of rental income or benefits from capital appreciation as investment property. 
Investment property is measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the cost model is applied. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, an item of investment property is carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment loss.Investment properties are derecognized either when they have been disposed of or when the investment property is permanently 
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in the period of de-recognition. Reclassification 
to or from other account is made if there is a change in use of corresponding investment property.Depreciation of investment property is calculated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives as follows:TypeBuildingsStructureUseful lives (years)20 ~ 5010 ~ 40(13) Intangible assets
An intangible asset is recognized only when its cost can be measured reliably, and the probabilities future economic benefits from the 
asset will flow into the Group are high. Separately acquired intangible assets are recognized at the acquisition cost, and subsequently, the 
cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment is recognized as the carrying amount.Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the 4-year to 30-year period of useful economic lives using the straight line method. At 
the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews intangible assets for any evidence that indicate impairment, and upon the presence 
of such evidence, the Group estimates the amount recoverable and recognizes the loss accordingly. Intangible assets are derecognized 
either when they have been disposed of or when the intangible assets are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit 
is expected from its disposal.Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually. Furthermore, the Group reviews such 
intangible assets to determine whether it is appropriate to consider these assets to have indefinite useful lives. If in the case the Group 
concludes an asset is not qualified to be classified as non-finite, prospective measures are taken to consider such an asset as finite.Expenditures on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, are 
recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Development expenditures are capitalized only if development costs can be measured reliably, the 
product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient 
resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. Other development expenditures are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.(14) Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group tests for any evidence of impairment in assets and reviews whether the impairment has taken place by estimating the 
recoverable amount, at the end of each reporting period. The Group estimates the recoverable amount of each asset or a whole cash-
generating unit unless it is possible to estimate the amount of the asset in that unit. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value 
less cost and value in use, of an asset. The Group recognizes the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount of 
the asset as an impairment loss if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business is allocated to each cash-generating unit that is expected to gain the benefits of 
the synergy effect. Impairment on cash-generating unit deducts other assets in proportion to their carrying amounts after deducting the 
carrying amount of goodwill allocated in that unit. Impairment loss on goodwill cannot be reversed once it is recognized.Except for impairment losses in respect of goodwill that are never reversed, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in 
the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed 
its recoverable amount, nor exceeds the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss 
been recognized for the asset in prior years.073073Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017(15) Assets held for sale
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use, are 
classified as held for sale. In order to be classified as held for sale, the asset (or disposal groups) must be available for immediate sale in 
its present condition and its sale must be highly probable. The assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as assets held for sale are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.The Group recognizes an impairment loss for any initial or subsequent write-down of an asset (or disposal groups) to fair value less costs 
to sell, and a gain for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell, up to the cumulative impairment loss previously recognized.Non-current assets that are classified as held for sale or part of a disposal group classified as held for sale are not depreciated (or amortized).(16) Non-derivative financial liabilities
The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities 
in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of financial liability. The Group recognizes these 
financial liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
financial liability.(i) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in the current year include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities 
designated at FVTPL upon initial recognition. Financial liabilities and derivatives are classified as financial instruments held for trading 
if they are acquired for the purpose of repurchasing in the near future. Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at FVTPL 
upon initial recognition, if the profit or loss from the liabilities indicates to be more purpose-appropriate to be recognized as profit or 
loss. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are designated at fair value in subsequent measurements, and any related un-realized profit or loss is 
recognized as profit or loss.(ii) Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are recognized at fair value less cost less transaction cost upon initial recognition, and 
subsequently at amortized costs. The difference between the proceeds (net of transaction cost) and the redemption value is recognized in 
the statement of comprehensive income over the periods of the liabilities using the EIR.Fees paid on the establishment of a loan facility are recognized as transaction costs of the loan, if the probability that some or all of the 
facility will be drawn down is high. The amount is deferred until the financial liability would be withdrawn. If, however, there is not enough 
evidence to conclude a draw-down of some or all of the facility will occur, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for liquidity services and 
amortized over the period of the facility to which it relates.(iii) De-recognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is de-recognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The 
difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability and the consideration paid is recognized in profit or loss.(17) Employee benefits(i) Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits are employee benefits that are due to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the reporting 
period in which the employees render the related service. When an employee has rendered service to the Group during an accounting 
period, the Group recognizes the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service.(ii) Retirement benefits: defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund. The Group is no longer 
responsible for any foreseeable future liability after a certain amount or percentage of money is set aside for defined contribution plans. If 
the pension plan allows for early retirement, payments are recognized as employee benefits. If the contribution already paid exceeds the 
contribution due for service before the end of the reporting period, the Group recognizes that excess as an asset to the extent that the 
prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.074074Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017(iii) Retirement benefits: defined benefit plans
The Group classifies all the pensions as defined benefit plans except defined contribution plans. The Group’s net obligation in respect of 
defined benefit plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, 
discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed 
annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in 
which the benefits will be paid, and have terms to maturity similar to the terms of the related pension liability.Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liabilities (assets), which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding 
interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income.(18) Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation.(19) Financial guarantees
Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer (the Group) to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a 
loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the original or changed terms of a debt 
instrument. Financial guarantees are initially recognized in the financial statements at fair value on the date the guarantee was given. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group’s liabilities under such guarantees are measured at the higher of:- The amount determined in accordance with K-IFRS 1109 ‘Financial Instruments’ and 
-  The initial amount recognized, less, when appropriate, cumulative amortization recognized in accordance with K-IFRS 1115 ‘Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers’.(20) Securities under resale or repurchase agreements
Securities purchased under agreements to resell are recorded as other loans and receivables and the related interest from these securities 
is recorded as interest income; Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are recorded as borrowings, and the related interest from 
these securities is recorded as interest expense.(21) Policy reserves for insurance contracts
In accordance with the Insurance Business Act and related insurance standards, the Group is required to maintain policy reserves, 
which consist of premium reserve, unearned premium reserve, reserve for outstanding claims, reserve for participating policyholders’ 
dividends, excess participating policyholders’ dividend reserve and reserve for loss on participating insurance policies, as a liability which 
is measured in accordance with the Manual for Calculation of Premium and Policy Reserves as approved by the Financial Supervisory 
Commission. Details are as follows:(i) Premium reserve
Premium reserve represents an amount calculated based on a net premium valuation, which is the greater of an amount calculated by 
using the standard interest rate and standard risk rate issued by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), and an amount calculated using 
an internally generated rate derived by the Group. If the reserve is at zero or less, the amount is to be recorded at nil.(ii) Unearned premium reserve
Unearned premium reserve represents an amount allocated for certain premiums whose initial payment date falls within the current 
reporting period and future payments, if any, fall subsequent to the end of the reporting period.075075Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017(iii) Guaranteed benefit reserve
Guaranteed benefit reserve guarantees a certain level of the insurance claims considering expected loss in the future. The Group’s 
guaranteed benefit reserve consists of the following:-  Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit: reserves that guarantee financial resources for the pension benefit amount that equals to the 
predetermined value in the contract. 
- Guaranteed minimum death benefit: reserves that guarantee death benefit amount that equals to the predetermined value in the contract. 
-  Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit: reserves that guarantee the interim withdrawals amount that equals to the predetermined value 
in the contract during the period for interim withdrawals. 
-  Guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit: reserves that guarantee the interim withdrawals amount that equals to the predetermined value in 
the contract during lifetime. 
-  Other guaranteed benefits: guaranteed benefit reserves other than those listed above for a guarantee of insurance proceeds in excess of 
a certain level.(iv) Reserve for outstanding claims
Reserve for outstanding claims represents a reserve based on estimate of loss for insured events that have occurred prior to the reporting 
date but have not yet been settled or determined, including:-  Outstanding losses: losses that have been reported to the insurer but are still in the process of settlement (in cases where a claim is 
partially paid, the remnant is reported). 
-  Incurred but not reported (IBNR): an estimate of the amount based on historical information of an insurer’s liability for claim-generating 
events that have taken place but have not yet been reported to the insurer. 
-  Reserve for lapsed insurance contracts: reserve for insurance cancellation refund for lapsed insurance contracts due to non-payment of 
insurance premium that still can be revived or deferred within a certain period. 
- Outstanding claims: legitimate claims, such as compensation, refund, dividend that an insurer has not yet paid to policy holder.(v) Reserve for participating policyholders’ dividends
The reserve for participating policyholders’ dividends is classified into interest dividend reserve, mortality dividend reserve, interest rate 
difference guarantee reserve and long-term duration dividend reserve.(vi) Excess participating policyholders’ dividend reserve
Pursuant to relevant laws and contracts, the Group may provide an excess participating policyholder dividend reserve based on the 
operating results of related insurance products. The reserve may be used to pay participating policyholder dividends or additional 
dividends.(22) Equity
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares and share options are 
recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.When the Group repurchases its share capital, the amount of the consideration paid is recognized as a deduction from equity and classified 
as treasury shares. The profits or loss from the purchase, disposal, reissue, or retirement of treasury shares are not recognized as current 
profit or loss. If the Group acquires and retains treasury shares, the consideration paid or received is directly recognized in equity.Non–controlling interests refer to equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Non- controlling interests consist 
of the minority interest net income calculated under K-IFRS 1103 ‘Business Combinations’ at the date of the initial combination, and 
minority interest of changes in equity after the business combination.(23) Government subsidy
Government subsidy without repayment obligation, which is used for the acquisition of certain assets, is accounted for as a deduction 
from the acquisition cost of the acquired assets. Such subsidy amount is offset against the depreciation or amortization of the acquired 
assets during such assets’ useful life.(24) Interest income and expense
Interest income and expense are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The effective interest method measures 
the amortized costs of financial instruments and allocates the interest income or expense during the related period.076076Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017Upon the calculation of the effective interest rate, the Group estimates future cash flows by taking into consideration all contractual terms 
of the financial instrument, but not future credit loss. The calculation also reflects any fees or points paid or received, transaction costs and 
any related premiums or discounts. In the case that the cash flow and expected duration of a financial instrument cannot be estimated 
reliably, the effective interest rate is calculated by the contractual cash flow during the contract period.Once an impairment loss has been recognized on a financial asset or a group of similar assets, subsequent interest income is recognized 
on the interest rate that was used to discount future cash flow for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.(25) Fees and commission income
Fees and commission income and expense are classified as follows according to related regulations:(i) Fees and commission from financial instruments
Fees and commission income and expense that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset or liability are included in the 
measurement of the effective interest rate. It includes those related to evaluation of the borrowers’ financial status, guarantee, collateral, 
other agreements and related evaluation as well as business transaction, rewards for activities, such as document preparation and 
recording and setup fees incurred during issuance of financial liabilities. However, when financial instruments are classified as financial 
instruments at fair value through profit or loss, fees and commission are recognized as revenue upon initial recognition.(ii) Fees and commission from services
Fees and commission income charged in exchange for services to be performed during a certain period of time such as asset management 
fees, consignment fees and assurance service fees are recognized as the related services are performed. When a loan commitment is not 
expected to result in the draw-down of a loan and K-IFRS 1039 ‘Financial Instrument: Recognition and Measurement’ is not applied for the 
commitment, the related loan commitment fees are recognized as revenue proportionally to time over the commitment period.(iii) Fees and commission from significant transaction
Fees and commission from significant transactions, such as trading stocks and other securities, negotiation and mediation activities for 
third parties, for instance business transfer and takeover, are recognized when transactions are completed.(26) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognized upon the establishment of the Group’s right to receive the payment.(27) Income tax expense
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. Current income tax and deferred income tax are recognized in profit or 
loss except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event, which is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity, or a business combination.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the reporting period when the assets 
are realized or the liabilities settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the 
reporting period. The measurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflects the income tax effects that would follow from the 
manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.Subsidiaries calculate income tax based on their tax laws and report the amount as current income tax liability. The Group recognizes 
deferred income tax liabilities for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates, and interests in 
joint ventures, except to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.The Group recognizes deferred income tax assets for all deductible temporary differences arising from investments in associates, to the 
extent that it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary difference can be utilized.The carrying amount of a deferred income tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred income tax asset to be 
utilized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only if the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset the related current 
income tax assets and liabilities, and the assets and liabilities relate to income tax levied by the same tax authority and are intended to be 
settled on a net basis.077077Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017(In millions of won)(28) Accounting for trust accounts
The Group, for the purpose of financial reporting, differentiates trust assets from identifiable assets according to the Financial Investment 
Services and Capital Markets Act. Furthermore, the Group receives trust fees from the application, management and disposal of trust 
assets, and appropriates such amounts for fees from trust accounts.Meanwhile, in the case the fee from an unspecified principal or interests guaranteed money in trust does not meet the principal or interest 
amount, even after appropriating deficit with trust fees and special reserve, the Group fills in the remaining deficit in the trust account and 
appropriates such amounts for losses on trust accounts.(29) Regulatory reserve for credit losses
When the total sum of allowance for possible credit losses under K-IFRS is lower than the amount prescribed in Article 29(1) of the 
Regulations on supervision of Banking Business, the Group records the difference as a regulatory reserve for credit losses at the end of 
each reporting period.In the case that the existing regulatory reserve for credit losses exceeds the amount needed to be set aside at the reporting date, the 
surplus may be reversed. Furthermore, in the case that undisposed deficit exists, a regulatory reserve for credit losses is saved from the 
time the undisposed deficit is disposed.(30) Earnings per share
The Group represents its diluted and basic earnings per common share in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Basic 
earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net profit attributable to shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number 
of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting net profit attributable to 
common shareholders of the Group, considering dilution effects from all potential common shares, and the weighted average number of 
common shares outstanding.(31) Correction of errors
Prior period errors shall be corrected by retrospective restatement in the first set of financial statements authorised for issue after their 
discovery except to the extent that it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the error.4.  Cash and Due from Banks(1) Cash and due from banks as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:Cash

transaction. The Group enters into hedging derivative transactions mainly for the purpose of hedging risk related to changes in fair values 
of the underlying assets and liabilities and future cash flows.The Group enters into trading derivative transactions such as futures, forwards, swaps and options for arbitrage transactions by 
speculating on the future value of the underlying asset. Trading derivative transactions include contracts with the Group’s clients and its 
liquidation position.For the purpose of hedging the exposure to the variability of fair values and future cash flows of funds in Korean won by changes in 
interest rate, the Group mainly uses interest swaps or currency swaps. The main counterparties are foreign financial institutions and local 
banks. In addition, to hedge the exposure to the variability of fair values of bonds in foreign currencies by changes in interest rate or 
foreign exchange rate, the Group mainly uses interest swaps or currency swaps.089089Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

Confirmed acceptances and guarantees, unconfirmed acceptances and guarantees and bills endorsed are not recognized on the statement 
of financial position, but are disclosed as off-statement of financial position items in the notes to the financial statements. The Group provides 
a provision for such off-statement of financial position items, applying a Credit Conversion Factor (CCF) and provision rates under the Group’s 
expected credit loss model, and records the provision as a reserve for expected credit losses on acceptances and guarantees.In the case of financial guarantee contracts, when the amount calculated using the same method as above is greater than the initial amount 
less amortization of fees recognized, the difference is recorded as a financial guarantee provision.(8) Provision for unused commitments
The Group records a provision for a certain portion of unused credit lines which is calculated using a CCF as provision for unused 
commitments applying provision rates under the Group’s expected credit loss model.(9) Provision for possible losses from lawsuits
As of December 31, 2018, the Group is involved in 257 lawsuits as a plaintiff and 328 lawsuits as a defendant. The aggregate amounts of 
claims as a plaintiff and a defendant amounted to ₩1,691,334 million and ₩1,928,754 million, respectively. The Group provided a provision 
against contingent loss from pending lawsuits as of December 31, 2018 and additional losses may be incurred depending on the final result 
of pending lawsuits.Some investors who bought the DSME’s shares, corporate bonds and commercial papers sued the DSME, certain accounting firm and 
others for damage claims asserting that they had misled by false audit report, business report, registration of securities, prospectus, etc. and

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017(In millions of won)(2) Fair value hierarchy of financial instruments disclosed by fair value(i) The Group’s policies for measuring fair value of financial instruments at amortized costs are as follows:-  Cash and due from banks: Fair value of cash is considered equivalent to the carrying amount. In the case of due from banks on demand, 
which do not have a set maturity and can be realized instantly, the carrying amount is a close estimate of the fair value and is assumed so. 
In the case of other ordinary due from banks, the cash flow discount method is used to estimate the fair value.
-  Loans measured at amortized cost: The fair value of loans measured at amortized cost is the expected future cash flows, reflecting 
premature redemption ratio, discounted by the market interest rate, adjusted by a spread sheet considering the probability of default. 
Exceptions to this method include loans with credit line facilities, loans with a maturity of three months or less left and impaired loans, which 
the Group assumes the carrying amount as the fair value. 
-  Securities measured at amortized cost: The fair value of securities measured at amortized cost is computed by widely-accepted appraisal 
agencies upon request.
-  Deposits: The fair value of deposits is computed using the discounted cash flow method. However, for deposits, whose cash flows cannot 
be estimated reasonably, the Bank assumes the carrying amount as the fair value.
-  Borrowings: For borrowings in Korean won, the fair value is computed using the discounted cash flow method. For borrowings in foreign 
currency, the fair value is computed by widely-accepted appraisal agencies upon request. However, for borrowings including call money 
whose contractual maturity is three months or less, the Group assumes the carrying amount as the fair value.
-  Debentures: The fair value of industrial financial debentures in Korean won, except structured debentures in Korean won, is computed using 
the discounted cash flow method. For structured industrial financial debentures in Korean won and industrial financial debentures in foreign 
currency, the fair value is computed by widely-accepted appraisal agencies upon request.
-  Other financial assets and liabilities: The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities is computed using the discounted cash flow 
method. However, in cases cash flow cannot be estimated reasonably, the Group assumes the carrying amount as the fair value.(ii) The fair value hierarchy of financial instruments disclosed by fair value as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:Financial assets:Cash and due from banks (*)

Internal Ratings-Based Approach.In conformity with the implementation roadmap of Basel II, the Group obtained the approval to use the Foundation Internal Ratings-Based 
Approach on credit risk from the FSS in July 2008 and has applied the approach since late June 2008. The Group applies the Standardized 
Approach on market risks and operational risks.The Group completed the Basel III standard risk management system in preparation of the adoption of the Basel III regulations announced on 
December 1, 2013. Starting from 2013 year-end, the BIS capital adequacy ratio has been measured in accordance to the Basel III regulations.Responding to the requirement of the financial authorities, the Group recognizes interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit bias risk and reputational 
risk as well as Pillar I risks (credit risk, market risk and operational risk). Since 2015, the Group has responded to Pillar II regulations including 
additional capital requirements based on comprehensive assessment on bank risk management level. Since the end of 2015, the Group has 
applied the uniform standards for the public announcement of financial business for Basel compliance.Furthermore, the Group is in the process of preparing revised standards such as capital requirements for banks’ investments in funds, which 
will take effect in 2017, and the Standardised Approach for measuring counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR), which will take effect in 2019.(viii) Internal capital adequacy assessment process
Internal capital adequacy assessment process is defined as the process that the Group aggregates significant risks, calculates its internal 
capital, compares the internal capital with the available capital and assesses its internal capital adequacy.144144Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2018 and 2017(In millions of won)- Internal capital adequacy assessment
For the purpose of the internal capital adequacy assessment, the Group calculates its aggregated internal capital by evaluating all significant 
risks and available capital taking into account the quality and components of capital, and then assesses the internal capital adequacy by 
comparing the aggregated internal capital with the available capital. In addition, the Group conducts periodic stress tests more than once 
every six months to assess potential weakness in crisis situations and uses its results to assess the internal capital adequacy. The Group 
assumes the macroeconomic situation as four stages of ‘normal-aggravation-pessimistic-serious’ and is preparing countermeasures such 
as checking the adequacy of capital by each stage.- Goal setting of internal capital management
The Group sets up and manages an internal capital limit on an annual basis, through the approval of the Risk Management Committee, in 
order to maintain internal capital adequacy by managing internal capital (integrated risks) within the extent of available capital.The prior year’s internal capital, analysis of domestic and foreign environment changes in the current year, and the direction and size of 
operations are all reflected in the goal setting of internal capital management to calculate the integrated internal capital scale. Moreover, Bank 
for International Settlements(“BIS”) capital adequacy ratio and risk appetite are taken into consideration in the goal setting of internal capital 
management- Allocation of internal capital
The Group’s entire internal capital is allocated to each segment and department, according to the extent of possible risk faced and size 
of operations, after the Risk Management Committee’s deliberation and the board of directors’ approval. The allocated internal capital is 
monitored regularly and managed using various management methods. The results of monitoring and managing the allocated internal 
capital are reported to the Risk Management Committee. In case of any material changes in the Group’s business plan or risk operation 
strategy, the Group adjusts the allocations elastically.- Composition of internal capital
Internal capital comprises all the significant risks of the Group and is composed of quantifiable and non-quantifiable risks. Quantifiable 
risks are composed of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk and credit concentration risk, foreign currency settlement 
risk, and are risks measured quantitatively by applying reasonable methodology using objective data. Non-quantifiable risks are composed 
of strategy risk, reputation risk, residual risk on asset securitization and furthermore. Non-quantifiable risks are those risks that cannot be 
measured quantitatively because of lack of data or the absence of appropriate measuring methodologies.(2) Credit Risk(i) ConceptCredit risk can be defined as potential loss resulting from the refusal to perform obligations or default of counterparties. More generally, it is 
used to refer to the possibility of loss from engaged bonds that cannot be redeemed properly or from substitute payments.(ii) Approach to credit risk managementSummary of credit risk management
The Group regards credit risk as the most significant risk area in its business operations, and accordingly, closely monitors its credit risk 
exposure. The Group manages both credit risks at portfolio level and at individual credit level. At portfolio level, the Group reduces credit 
concentration and restructures the portfolio in such a way to maximize profitability considering the risk level. To avoid credit concentration on 
a particular sector, the Group manages credit limits by client, group, and industry. The Group also resets exposure management directives for 
each industry by conducting an industry credit evaluation twice a year.At the individual credit level, the relationship manager (RM), the credit officer (CO) and the Credit Review Committee manage each borrower’s 
credit risk.Post management and insolvent borrower management
The Group monitors the borrower’s credit rating from the date of the loan to the date of the final collection of debt consistently, and inspects the 
borrower’s status regularly and frequently in order to prevent the generation of new bad debts and to stabilize the number of debt recoveries.In addition, an early warning system is operated to spot borrowers that are highly likely to be insolvent. The early warning system provides 
financial information, financial transaction information, public information and market information of the borrower, and such information is used 
by the RM and the CO to monitor and manage changes in the borrower’s credit rating.Under the early warning system, a borrower that is highly likely to be insolvent is classified as an early warning borrower or a precautionary 
borrower The Group sets up a specific and applicable stabilization plan for such a borrower considering the borrower’s characteristics. 
Furthermore, sub-standard borrowers are classified as insolvent borrowers, and are managed intensively by the Group, which takes legal 
proceedings, disposals or corporate turnaround measures if necessary.145145Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

December 31, 2018 and 2017(In millions of won)Classification of asset soundness and provision of allowance for loss
Classification of asset soundness is fulfilled by the analysis and assessment of credit risk. The classification is used in order to provision an 
appropriate allowance, prevent further occurrences of insolvent assets and promote the normalization of existing insolvent assets to enhance 
the stabilization of asset operations.Based on the Financial Supervisory Regulations of the Republic of Korea, the Group has established standards and guidelines on the 
classification of asset soundness, according to the Forward-Looking Criteria (FLC), which reflects not only the borrower’s past records of 
repayment but also their future debt repayment capability.In conformity with these standards, the Group classifies the soundness of its assets as “normal”, “precautionary”, “substandard”, “doubtful”, 
or “estimated loss” and differentiates the coverage ratio by the level of classification.Details of loans by credit rating as of December 31, 2018 are as follows:< Corporate >AAA ~ BBB1

Collective assessment(iii) Measurement methodology of credit riskPursuant to Basel II, the Group selects the measurement methodology of credit risk considering the complexity of measurement, 
measurement factors, estimating methods and others. Measurement approaches are divided into Standardized Approach and Internal 
Ratings-Based Approach.Standardized Approach (SA)
In the case of the Standardized Approach, the risk weights are applied according to the credit rating assessed by External Credit Assessment 
Institution (ECAI). Risk weights in each credit rating are as follows:Credit rating
AAA ~ AA-A+ ~ A-BBB+ ~ BBB-BB+ ~ BB-B+ ~ B-Below B-UnratedCorporate20.00%50.00%100.00%100.00%150.00%150.00%100.00%Country0.00%20.00%50.00%100.00%100.00%150.00%100.00%Bank20.00%50.00%100.00%100.00%100.00%150.00%100.00%The OECD, S&P, Moody’s and Fitch are designated as foreign ECAI and Korea Investors Service Co., Ltd., NICE Investors Services Co., Ltd. 
and the Korea Ratings Co., Ltd. are designated as domestic ECAI.The Group applies the credit rating based on the corresponding loan and same borrower’s unsecured senior loans. In the case the borrower’s 
risk weight is higher than the unrated exposure’s risk weight (100%), the higher weight is applied. In the case the borrower has more than one 
rating, the higher weight of the two lowest weights (Second Best Criteria) is applied.Internal Ratings-Based Approach (IRB)
To use the Internal Ratings-Based Approach, a bank must be approved by the FSS and should also meet the requirement pre-set by the FSS.In relation to Basel II that has been adopted domestically as of January 2008, the Group gained approval from the FSS to use the 
Foundation Internal Ratings-Based Approach in July 2008. The Group has calculated credit risk-weighted assets using the approach since 
late June 2008.148148Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Ratings-Based Approach as of December 31, 2018.The Standard Approach is applied to special finance, non-residents, non-banking financial institutions currently, and will be replaced by the 
Internal Ratings-Based Approach in the future.The Standardized Approach is applied to country exposures, public institution exposures and bank exposures permanently and applied to 
overseas subsidiary and the Bank’s branch pursuant to prior consultation with the FSS.<Approved measurement method>Measurement methodExposureStandardized ApproachFoundation Internal

The Group calculates the 
credit risk-weighted assets using the capital adequacy ratio.Upon the calculation of credit risk-weighted assets for derivatives, the Group takes into consideration the set-off effects of transactions under

December 31, 2018 and 2017(In millions of won)Credit rating model
The results of credit rating are presented as grades through an assessment of the debt repayment capacity that the principal and interest of 
debt securities or loans are redeemed while complying with contractual redemption schedule.Using the Group’s internal credit rating model, the Group classifies debtors’ credit rating into 14 grades (AAA~D). To distinguish the 
difference between credits in the same grade, the Group uses 20 stages as auxiliaries to 14 grades.The Group’s regular credit rating process is carried out once a year and in the case of the change of debtor’s credit condition, the credit rating 
is frequently adjusted as necessary to retain the adequacy of credit rating.The results of credit rating are applied to various areas such as discrimination of loan processes, loan limit, loan interest rate, post loan 
management standard process, credit risk measurement, and allowance for loan losses assessment.Credit rating process control structure
According to the Principle of Checks and Balances, the Group has established the credit rating process control structure by which the credit 
rating system operates appropriately.-  Independent assessment of credit rating: The Bank’s business segment (RM) and credit rating assessment segment (Credit Rating Officer) 
are independently operated.
-  Independent control of credit rating system: The control of credit rating system including the development of credit rating model is 
independently implemented by the Bank’s Risk Management Department.
-  Independent verification of credit rating system: Credit rating system is independently verified by Risk Validation Team of the Financial 
Planning Department.
-  Internal audit of credit rating process: Credit rating process is audited by the Bank’s internal audit department.
-  Role of the Board of Directors and the Bank’s management: Major issues relating to credit rating process are approved by the Board of 
Directors and are regularly monitored by the Bank’s top management.The Group reviews debt serviceability based on a credit analysis when handling loans. Depending on the results, credit loan preservation is 
adjusted as necessary using such methods as interest rate preservation due to credit risk.The Group evaluates the value of the collateral, performing ability and legal validity of the guarantee at the initial acquisition. The Group re-
evaluates the provided collateral and guarantees regularly for them to be reasonably preserved.For guarantees, the Group demands a corresponding written guarantee according to loan handling standards and the guarantor’s credit 
rating is independently calculated when in conformance with the credit rating endowment method.The quantification of the extent to which collateral and other credit enhancements mitigate credit risk of impaired financial assets as of

December 31, 2018 and 2017(3) Capital management activities(In millions of won)(i) Capital adequacy
The FSS approved the Group’s use of the Foundation Internal Ratings-Based Approach in July 2008. The Group has been using the same 
approach when calculating credit risk-weighted assets since the end of June 2008. The equity capital ratio and equity capital according to 
the standards of the Bank for International Settlements are calculated for the purpose of such disclosure. The equity capital ratio and equity 
capital are calculated on a consolidated basis. In conformity with the Banking Act, which is based on the implementation of Basel III on 
December 1, 2013, the regulatory capital is divided into the following two categories.Tier 1 capital (Common Equity Tier 1 + Additional Tier 1 capital)
- Common Equity Tier 1
Regulatory capital that represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the Group, takes the first and proportionately greatest 
share of any losses as they occur, and which principal is never repaid outside of liquidation meets the criteria for classification as common 
equity, including capital stock, capital surplus, retained earnings, qualifying non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, and accumulated other 
comprehensive income as common equity Tier 1.- Additional Tier 1 capital
Capital stock and capital surplus related to issuance of capital securities that are subordinated, have non-cumulative and conditional 
dividends or interests, and have no maturity or step-up conditions.Tier 2 capital (Supplementary Tier 2 capital)
Regulatory capital that fulfils supplementary capital adequacy requirements, and includes subordinated debt with maturities over 5 years and 
allowance for loan losses in conformity with external regulatory standards and internal standards.The BIS capital adequacy ratio and capital in accordance to Basel III standards as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:BIS capital adequacy ratioEquity capital based on BIS (A):

34,054,846Market risk is defined as the possibility of potential loss on a trading position resulting from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates and the price of stocks and derivatives. Trading position is exposed to risks, such as interest rate, stock price, and foreign exchange 
rate, etc. Non-trading position is mostly exposed to interest rates. Accordingly, the Group classifies market risks into those exposed from 
trading position or those exposed from non-trading position.(ii) Market risks of trading positionsManagement method on market risks arising from trading positions
Trading position includes securities, foreign exchange position, and derivatives which are traded for short-term profits.Market risk is managed using VaR limit and loss limit. VaR limit is calculated in the view of entire Group and the calculated VaR limit is 
distributed into each department and each type (stock price, interest rate, foreign exchange rate and option). The trading department 
regulates and operates terms of stop loss and investment limits.Using the Standardized Approach and internal model of VaR, the Group’s VaR is measured daily and the measured VaR is used for risk 
monitoring and limit management. In the estimation of VaR, the historical simulation and two other supplemental procedures are used: 
variance-covariance matrix and Monte Carlo simulation. Through the stress test and back test, the estimation of VaR is validated daily.In estimating market risk, the Standardized Approach and the internal model are used. The Standardized Approach is used in order to 
calculate the required capital from market risk and the internal model is used in order to manage risks internally.Since July 2007, the Group has measured one-day VaR through the historical simulation method using the time series data of past 250 days 
under a 99% confidence level. The calculated VaR is monitored on a daily basis.The Group sets total limit of market risk based on annual business plan, risk appetite and others and monitors VaR limit of each department 
on a daily basis.156156Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

The most critical market risk that arises in non-trading position is the interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is defined as the likely loss resulting 
from the unfavorable fluctuation of interest rate in the Group’s financial condition and is measured by interest rate VaR and interest rate EaR.Interest rate VaR is the maximum amount of decrease in net asset value resulting from the unfavorable fluctuation of interest rate. Interest rate 
EaR is the maximum amount of decrease in net interest income resulting from the unfavorable fluctuation of interest rate for a year.The Group’s interest rate VaR and interest rate EaR are measured through the simulation of conclusive interest rate scenario with the FERMAT 
and are reported on a monthly basis to the Risk Management Committee. The Management’s target of interest rate VaR and interest rate EaR 
are approved at the beginning of the year. Additionally, the interest rate VaR and interest rate EaR on consolidated basis are calculated using 
the Standardized Approach in order to retain the consistency in the methods used by the Bank and its subsidiaries.VaR/EaR of non-trading positions

December 31, 2018 and 2017(In millions of won)(5) Liquidity risk management(i) Concept
Liquidity risk is defined as the possibility of potential loss due to a temporary shortage in funds caused by a maturity mismatch or an 
unexpected capital outlay. Liquidity risk soars when funding rates rise, assets are sold below a normal price, or a good investment opportunity 
is missed.(ii) Approach to liquidity risk management
The Group manages its liquidity risks as follows:Allowable limit for liquidity risk
∙ The allowable limit for liquidity risk sets LCR, foreign currency liquidity ratio, and remaining maturity gap
∙   The management standards with regards to the allowable limit for liquidity risk should be set using separate and stringent set ratios inaccordance with the FSS guidelines.<Measurement Methodology>
• LCR: (High quality liquid assets / Total net cash outflows over the next 30 calendar days) X 100
• Foreign currency liquidity ratio: (Maturing liquidity asset in the interval / Maturing liquidity liability in the interval) X 100
• Remaining maturity gap: (Maturing liquidity asset in the interval - Maturing liquidity liability in the interval) / total assets X 100Early warning indicator
In order to identify prematurely and cope with worsening liquidity risk trends, the Group has set up 17 indexes such as the “Foreign Exchange 
Stabilization Bond CDS Premium,” and measures the trend monthly, weekly and daily as a means for establishing the allowable liquidity risk 
limit complementary measures.Stress-Test analysis and contingency plan
•  The Group evaluates the effects on the liquidity risk and identifies the inherent flaws. In the case where an unpredictable and significant 
liquidity crisis occurs, the Group executes risk situation analysis quarterly based on crisis specific to the Group, market risk and complex 
emergency, and reports to the Risk Management Committee for the purpose of the Group’s solvency securitization.• The Group established detailed contingency plan to manage the liquidity risks at every risk situations.(iii) Analysis on remaining contractual maturity of financial instrumentsRemaining contractual maturity analysis for non-derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:Financial assets:Cash and due from banks
