in our determination to be at the forefront offinancial innovationKB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018007Dear  respected  shareholders  at  home  and 
abroad!military pension certificate issuer and custodian bank of 
local governments.I  would  like  to  deliver  my  heartfelt  gratitude  to 
our  shareholders  for  the  unwavering  support  and 
encouragement you have  extended to KB Financial 
Group.
 
The business environment in the previous year was 
marked  by  deepening  uncertainties.  The  domestic 
economy struggled with a slowdown and mounting 
anxieties over growing household debt. On the external 
front, we saw financial volatility increase due to interest 
rate hikes and a prolonged U.S.-China trade conflict. 
Confronted with those challenges, however, KB Financial 
Group has remained steadfast in our determination to 
be at the forefront of financial innovation and to secure 
stable sources of growth in the years ahead.
 
In our preemptive response to the rapidly changing 
digital  environment,  we  undertook  the  “Digital 
Transformation” initiative which included expanding 
our  digital  banking  counters,  upgrading  our  core 
mobile  applications  and  introducing  RPA  (Robotic 
Process Automation) for work process automation. 
As a financial group with the nation's most diversified 
business network, we have also expanded our multi-
service branch network based on collaboration among 
subsidiaries  and  launched  a  variety  of  packaged 
products, thereby enhancing the “One firm” synergy 
objective for better customer experience.
 
Moreover, we have continued our efforts to secure new 
customers and expand our loyal customer base, having 
been selected as the national defense welfare card andIn the meantime, KB Financial Group has strengthened 
the foundation for our global business. This includes 
acquiring shares in Bank Bukopin of Indonesia, launching 
“KB Securities Vietnam,” a local subsidiary of KB Securities, 
taking over “KB Daehan Specialized Bank,” a specialized 
bank in Cambodia, and expanding our global IB network.
 
Let me briefly review our operating performance in the 
previous year.
 
In 2018, KB Financial Group posted KRW 3,061.2 billion in 
net profit, down KRW 250.2 billion from the previous year 
despite an increase in interest income delivered by robust 
growth of operating assets and improved net interest 
margins. This result is mainly attributable to the decline 
in commission revenues and other operating gains due 
to the sluggish stock market and a worsened insurance 
loss ratio. Also contributing were an increase in general 
and administrative expenses due to a year-end voluntary 
retirement scheme and special bonuses.Total assets of the Group as of the end of 2018 reached 
KRW 479.6 trillion, an increase of KRW 42.8 trillion year-
on-year due mainly to well- balanced growth of loans 
targeting strategic household products and valued small 
and SoHo businesses as well as the expansion of securities 
operation volume aimed at diversifying revenue sources.It is with regret that we could not deliver improved 
performance over the previous year in terms of margins 
despite our employees' passionate dedication to asset 
growth. This year, we at KB Financial Group pledge to008 INTRODUCTIONKB Financial Group will pool our wisdom and capacityeven harder, thus raising our status as the market-leading 
financial group guiding financial innovation and securingsustainable growth enginesensure that the Group's many resources are mobilized 
in order to achieve financial outcomes which live up to 
shareholders' expectations and the status of KBFG.
 
The business environment in 2019 is anticipated to be 
difficult as the uncertainty in global financial markets 
persists, owing to, in great part, the continuing U.S.-
China  trade  conflict  and  changes  in  U.S.  monetary 
policy.Moreover, the inroads of global ICT businesses, equipped 
with  advanced  technologies  and  comprehensive 
platforms, into the financial industry will continue as a 
major challenge to the financial industry.
 
In an era where these uncertainties and risks have all 
become the norm and as we strive to establish our 
status  as  the  innovative  “market-leading  financial 
group," KBFG is committed to concentrating resources 
on the following initiatives:First, we will further enhance the competitive edge 
of each subsidiary and business segment to solidify 
our status as Korea's leading financial group.Kookmin Bank will maintain its superiority over our 
competitors  and  secure  unrivaled  positions  in  key 
banking areas. Core subsidiaries such as KB Securities, 
KB Insurance and KB Kookmin Card will sharpen theircompetitive edge under the philosophy of “back to 
the basics” and lead their respective markets as top-
tier financial institutions. In each business segment, we 
will provide differentiated services based on organic 
collaboration under the "One firm" system.Second,  we  will  innovate  and  advance  core 
infrastructure to ensure more efficient business 
systems thus improving customer convenience.By pursuing digital innovation with a flexible mindset 
that suits the needs of customers, we will become the 
leading financial group that can be most trusted and 
preferentially selected by customers.Third, we will set in place a dynamic and creative 
corporate  culture  representative  of  KBFG  and 
innovate the way we work.We will continue to pursue our ubiquitous and mobile 
working environment for higher business efficiency and 
establish the “Smart Work” system aimed at handling 
value added tasks in a swift manner. In addition, we 
will endeavor to build KB's unique agile organizational 
structure  to  make  our  businesses  more  creative 
and  productive.  We  will  enhance  our  group-wide 
collaboration  system  among  core  business  sectors 
encompassing  digital  innovation,  WM,  CIB,  capital 
market, retail, SME and insurance.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018009With the management keyword “R.I.S.E. 2019,” we willrise to challenges and take a step forwardLastly, we will continue to diversify into  business 
areas that will allow us to secure sustainable growth 
for years to come.We pledge to further expand our business portfolio while 
promoting strategic M&As with the aim of identifying 
future growth engines. Based on the two-track strategy 
targeting both South East Asian markets and advanced 
economies, the Group will globally diversify its revenue 
sources. Opportunities with promising growth potential in 
the asset management business will be strategically and 
collaboratively reviewed at the Group level to ensure our 
competitive position.
 
The management environment this year will be no less 
challenging than last. However, we at KB Financial Group, 
by pooling our experience, capabilities and resources to 
an even greater degree, will raise our status as the leading 
innovative, sustainable growth financial company in Korea.
 
I ask for your continued support and encouragement 
in this journey and wish you and your loved ones good 
health and happiness.Jong Kyoo YoonChairman and CEO

KB Financial Group continues to increase its presence in the global 
market, diversifying revenue portfolio. Particularly, our global 
business strategy has focused on cultivating some hub markets to 
ensure more effective use of the Group’s resources. It has resulted 
in the Group securing a stable foundation for localized digital 
banking, auto finance, MFI, and securities in Cambodia, Laos, 
Myanmar, and Vietnam. Now we are striving to generate synergy 
among businesses in those countries.KB Kookmin Bank has acquired a 22 percent stake in Bank 
Bukopin of Indonesia in July 2018, becoming the second-largest 
shareholder of the bank. In May, KB Kookmin Bank converted its 
London subsidiary into branch office. It enables the branch office to 
raise capital more efficiently by capitalizing on the credit rating of 
KB Kookmin Bank headquarters. Going forward, we plan to further 
boost our CIB business including the increase of syndicated loan 
through the expansion of individual exposure limit. KB Kookmin 
Card acquired the entire shares in TSB (Tomato Specialized Bank) 
of Cambodia In April 2018 along with Indochina Bank, a subsidiary 
of Kolao Group. The ownership of KB Kookmin Card and Indochina 
Bank is 90% and 10%, respectively. Renamed into KB Daehan 
Specialized Bank, the bank is now in full operation. To begin with, 
the bank will promote auto financing, credit loan, and credit 
card businesses, ultimately focusing on installment financing for 
automobiles locally produced by Kolao Group.KB Asset Management initiated global business by acquiring 
the Singapore subsidiary of KB Securities in October 2017. The 
company established a local subsidiary in Shanghai, China, in 
September 2018 to survey local market and business conditions. 
Moreover, in response to growing investment in China and South 
East Asia by Korean investors and expanding asset management 
market, KB Asset Management is preparing to enter the Southeast 
Asian asset management market going forward.Reorganization for Stronger Synergy Creation
The Group newly formed the Digital Transformation Business Unit 
for the purpose of coping with digital environmental changes and 
securing the driving force for group-wide digital transformation. 
The Retail Customer Business Unit and Small&Medium Enterprise 
Business Unit were launched to prepare an integrated service 
system for individuals and SMEs. We also introduced the Insurance 
Business Unit to swiftly respond to increasingly stringent capital 
regulations and to boost synergy between KB Insurance and 
KB Life Insurance. As a result, KB Finance Group operates seven 
strategic Business Unit (Digital Transformation, WM, CIB, Capital 
Market, Retail Customer, SME, Insurance) beyond existing threeBusiness Unit (WM, CIB, Capital Market). The strategic Business 
Unit system, which has been a universal management system in 
many global financial companies, is expected to help us further 
enhance synergy among subsidiaries and solidify our status as the 
leading financial group.“New Mission & Vision” and Innovative Corporate Culture

body at KB Financial Group, deliberates and votes on major 
management items of the holding company and its subsidiaries. 
As of the end of 2018, non-executive directors held a majority 
of the BOD (7 non-executive directors, 1 executive director, 
and 1 non-standing director), ensuring faithful check function 
on the management. The Chairman and CEO of KB Financial 
Group is appointed at the general meeting of shareholders in 
accordance with the Articles of Incorporation. Candidates are 
selected and screened through fair and strict processes by the 
CEO Nominating Committee consisting solely of non-executive 
directors in advance.The  BOD  has  defined  “shareholder  representative, 
professionalism, and diversity” as core principles in appointing 
non-executive directors. To this end, the BOD maintains a pool 
of candidates with expertise in financial business, accounting, 
finance, law and regulation, risk management, HR, IT, and 
consumer  protection.  The  candidate  nomination  process 
consists of three stages; candidate pooling, evaluation, and 
nomination. We set up fire walls between each stage to operate 
the process independently and fairly. The candidate pool is 
regularly managed twice a year and headhunting firms are 
employed when searching candidates. We also operate a system 
to give any shareholder who has at least 1 share chances to 
recommend candidates. This system was introduced for the first 
time in the industry to strengthen communication with them.Corporate Governance GoalSecuringIndependence

Individual KB Star Club System” in order to strengthen loyal

multiple transactions with our subsidiaries. Promotional menu

ManagementKB Financial Group's risk management system focuses on efficiently 
supporting the mid to long-term strategies and management 
decision-making processes of the Group. To that end, it pursues 
enhancing risk transparency of the Group, preventing risk transfer 
among subsidiaries, and making preemptive responses to the 
rapidly-changing financial environment.
 
Risk Governance
The Risk Management Committee establishes risk management 
strategies, determines the bearable risk appetite, reviews the 
Group's risk management status, and approves whether to 
apply the risk management system, methodologies, and major 
improvements. The Risk Management Council consists of the 
Risk Management Officers from the holding company and its 
subsidiaries. The Council deliberates matters delegated by the 
Risk Management Committee and discusses the details of the 
risk management. Risk Management Department of the holding 
company monitors and manages Group risk status and internal 
capital limits by establishing risk management policies and 
operating relevant processes.
 
Credit Risk Management 
KB  Financial  Group  defines  credit  risk  as  the  expected/
unexpected losses arising from default of the counterparty or 
declining creditworthiness.˙ Credit Policy Direction: Based on management strategies, KBFinancial Group establishes its credit policy in consideration of 
economic outlook, business environment, asset soundness trends, 
and risk management capabilities. The credit policy is made the 
basis of household, corporate, and credit card loan policies. The 
basic direction of the credit policy is to generate stable income 
and maximize the Group’s value by maintaining asset soundness 
and minimizing mid to long-term credit cost volatility.˙  Credit Risk Measurement and Management: KB FinancialGroup  applies  the  credit  risk  measurement  system  that 
adopted calculation standards of the Internal Ratings Based 
Approach to the check of CaR (Capital at Risk). The CaR means 
possible maximum amount of loss under a certain level in 
business activities due to credit rating changes of borrowers 
or trade partners. It is calculated by reflecting the possibility of 
borrowers’ bankruptcy, potential loss of exposure, remaining 
maturity, and correlation with the economy. We also recognize, 
check, and monitor the credit concentration risk that can be 
arisen from unequal distribution of business portfolio to specific 
borrowers or sectors.˙ Total Exposure Limit Management:  We operate the TotalExposure Limit Management System to prevent excessive 
credit risk exposure and concentration of assets in specific 
sectors and optimize credit portfolio through stable asset 
management. Risk Management Department of the holding 
company  monitors  and  reports  the  results  to  the  Risk 
Management Committee on a regular basis.Market Risk Management
Defining market risk as possible losses from trading positions 
mainly due to fluctuating market drivers such as interest rate, 
exchange rate, and stock price, KB Financial Group recognizes, 
measures, monitors, controls, and reports market risks inherent 
in bonds, foreign currencies, stocks, and derivatives. VaR (Market 
Value at Risk), as a quantification index to measure the risk 
inherent in a trading account, indicates the maximum amount of 
loss that can be incurred in a portfolio over a period of time at 
a certain level of confidence. The Group verifies the adequacy 
of the VaR model on a daily basis by comparing actual and 
virtual profit/loss with the VaR calculation results. In the case of 
assets or subsidiaries where Market VaR cannot be applied, we 
adopt the standard method of supervision at the group level to 
manage risk capital.
 
Interest Rate Risk Management
Interest rate risk is defined as the risk of a decrease in the net 
asset value or net interest income (NII) caused by unfavorable 
interest rate trends. The goal of interest rate risk management is 
to maximize net interest income within the acceptable risk range 
by managing assets and liabilities in a comprehensive manner 
and minimize the loss of net interest margin that can be caused 
by adverse interest rate fluctuations.
 
Liquidity Risk Management
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk arising from inconsistency in the 
maturity of funds and failure to respond to unexpected demand/
supply of funds. We manage liquidity risk in a systemic manner in 
order to secure liquidity for loans and investment in bonds as well as 
to meet the demand for cash outflows such as deposit withdrawals, 
maturity of financial bonds, and repayment of borrowings.Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is defined as any financial and non-financial 
risks with negative affect on capital management arising from 
operating activities. Operational risk management aims to meet 
regulatory objectives of the supervisory agency and to spread 
the risk management culture companywide by tightening 
internal control process.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018031Internal Capital Management
Internal capital is the capital required to prevent economic 
insolvency due to unexpected losses under the target confidence 
level. KB Financial Group manages group capital adequacy by 
measuring, allocating, and managing internal capital of each 
subsidiary by risk type. The Risk Management Committee 
determines the risk appetite of the Group and allocates internal 
capital by risk type and by subsidiary. Each subsidiary then 
operates businesses within the allocated capital.Stress Testing
Stress testing is conducted to analyze the potential vulnerabilities 
of business portfolio based on a scenario set at changes in eco-
nomic conditions and to establish optimum countermeasures. KB 
Financial Group carries out stress testing that reflects business 
cycle and economic outlook at least once a year to analyze 
how rapidly-changing environment affects the Group and pre-
emptively respond to those risks. The results are reported to the 
management and Risk Management Committee to help them set 
risk appetite/limits and make proper decisions at the Group level.Risk Management Organizationlimits˙Determine risk appetite and internal capital

We define emerging risks as new types of risks arising from economic, environmental, and social changes that have significant 
impacts on our business activities in the long term. Emerging risks are efficiently managed through preemptive response activities. We 
have also identified “demographic change caused by low birth rate and population aging” and “changes in business activities driven 
by innovation of digital finance” as critical emerging risks. Definition, long-term impact on business, and our responses in terms of the 
risks are as follows:Emerging RisksDefinitionImpact on BusinessRisk Reduction ActivitiesDemographicchange caused by 
low birth rate and 
population agingChanges in business 
activities driven by 
the innovation ofdigital financeThe demographic change 
including population aging will 
cause decreases in savings rate 
and household income as elderly 
debtors come to stop engaging 
in economic activities, which can 
lead to deterioration of asset 
qualityThe asset quality analysis of age-
specific household credit loan 
borrowers shows that asset quality 
deteriorates with age.The innovation of digital finance 
provides financial firms with new 
growth opportunities, while lack of 
preparation for new technologies and 
financial innovation could deteriorate 
competitiveness. At the same time, 
new technologies and innovations 
could bring about new operating risks 
in terms of IT system, information 
security, financial fraud, etc.The progress of digital finance 
driven by technological innovation 
is critically affecting entire value 
chain of traditional financial 
business and fundamentally 
changing the way of doing 
business, thereby creating new 
business models, products, and 
services.It is expected that debtors in our 
loan portfolio will reach age groups 
that are highly likely to experience 
decline in income, which could 
ultimately lead to deterioration 
of asset quality. In response, we 
are proactively enhancing our risk 
management process including 
upgrading our credit guideline 
considering debtors' income level 
by life cycle and their debt amount.To respond to new risks caused by 
digital innovation, we are proactive 
in analyzing and identifying 
potential risks and coming up 
with effective countermeasures. 
At the same time, we are 
taking full advantage of new 
technologies such as big data and 
machine learning to enhance risk 
management capabilities.Operating the Basel III Internal Ratings Based Approach 
for Group Credit Risk
In response to the introduction of the Basel III regulation frame-
work, KB Financial Group had established human and physical infra-
structure that can cope with changes in financial regulation envi-
ronment. As a result, the Group has been calculating risk-weighted 
assets and capital adequacy ratio in accordance with the Basel III 
framework since December 2013. Furthermore, with the aim of 
improving the risk management capability of subsidiaries, we built 
the Group-level Internal Ratings Based Approach system which was 
approved by the FSS. This system has been applied to the calcula-
tion of BIS ratio of the Group since 2016, contributing to improving

including risk control methods, data handling, and control structure, 
establish the culture of risk management. We expect this system to 
help us further upgrade Group-wide risk management level, inter-
national creditworthiness, and management soundness.Direction of Group Risk Management for 2019
The financial market environment seems to be unfavorable 
in 2019 due to uncertainties at home and abroad caused by 
prolonged U.S.-China trade conflict, changes in interest rate 
policy of the U.S., household debt burden, and sluggish real 
estate market. As those potential risks can pose a threat to the 
soundness and profitability of financial companies, efficient risk 
management is more critical than ever before. Therefore, KB 
Financial Group intends to reinforce monitoring and pre-risk 
management activities on fluctuations of interest rate, exchange 
rate, and stock prices to help subsidiaries minimize risks and 
maintain industry-leading asset quality. We will also be proactive 
in monitoring possible risks with regard to their overseas 
expansion and new business operation.Digital FinanceKey Tasks in 2018KB  Finance  Group  has  been  focusing  on  advancing  the

in 2018, for example, different services based on cross-industry 
cooperation based on Open API, increase in data analysis and 
application, AI/machine learning development, and channel 
strategy  for  seamless  on/offline  customer  connection.  A

environment such as tough regulations on real estate market 
and household debt, stricter standards on financial soundness for 
financial firms, enactment of the Financial Consumer Protection 
Act, FX deregulations, the government’s support for SMEs, and

Amid the changes in market environment, KB Kookmin Bank 
remained focused on establishing new customer management 
system and improving customer management process. We not 
only carried out level-up campaigns aimed at strengthening 
incentives for loyal customers and expanding loyal customer 
base, but also developing and selling various package products

band BTS, the first Asian artists to top Billboard 200 chart, has 
attracted around 125,000 accounts after three months of launch

asset management service to corporate members, strengthening 
collaboration between WM and corporate financing sectors. We

the GOLD & WISE, vitalizing portfolio investment by improving 
customer options and convenience, and securing differentiated

The domestic financial market remained sluggish in 2018 due 
to the uncertainties in the global financial market caused by the 
U.S. interest rate hike, changing political situation both at home 
and abroad, and increasing risks of large companies. Faced with 
those challenges, KB Kookmin Bank’s CIB Customer Group has 
made a concerted effort to keep on flexible and qualitative 
growth, strengthen fundamental competitiveness in large 
corporate customer channel, diversifying business portfolio, 
thereby securing a solid foundation for the growth of IB business.Major achievements were as follows: Ranked top in underwriting 
syndicated loan for three consecutive years by the Bloomberg 
league table, successfully underwrote the acquisition financing 
for LS Automotive and LS Mtron’s copper foil and thin film 
business division, market financing for KRW 4.7 trillion worth 
of Gangneung Anin Thermoelectric Power Plant project and 
KRW 550 billion worth of Gwangmyung-Seoul Expressway 
construction project, and a variety of deals such as expressway 
construction in Poland and aircraft financing.In 2019, we plan to accelerate global expansion based on existing 
regional hubs in Hong Kong, New York, and London, securing 
the foundation for KB Financial Group to grow into a global 
player. To that end, we will organize a team dedicated to new 
market exploration and establish the hub-and-spoke business 
network centered on Hong Kong, New York, and London.Moreover, the improvement of asset portfolio will be promoted 
to seek qualitative growth based on safe assets and raise capital 
efficiency in response to deepening market uncertainties.SME BankingLeading Productive Financial Support
In 2018, the government encouraged financial businesses to 
further focus on productive financing aimed at redirecting 
capital  flow  from  real  estate  and  household  sector  to 
innovative  start-ups  and  SMEs.  KB  Kookmin  Bank  was 
proactive in meeting the government’s policy and as a result, 
ranked top in SME loan increase (KRW 8.9 trillion) and growth 
rate (10.0%) year-on-year in the banking industry. Particularly, 
our efforts for loan quality control contributed to improve 
the proportion of loans to healthy SMEs to 74.7% at the end 
of 2018 from 70.8% in the previous year. Delinquency rate 
maintained 0.60%, the lowest level in the banking industry.We promise to maintain the top ranking in 2019 as well in 
terms of SME loan increase, growth rate, and delinquency rate 
by adhering to healthy SME customer attraction strategy and 
raising KRW 8.5 trillion in net amount. Efforts for improving 
profitability such as expanding subordinate transactions with

over lower-than-expected global economic growth, prolonged 
U.S.-China trade conflict, and BREXIT issue, KB Kookmin Bank 
successfully issued the sustainability bond worth USD 300 
million for the first time among Korean banks in October 2018.

foreign investors on the strength of our outstanding operating 
performance and good credit ratings.The  final  order  book  was  over  USD  1.9  billion  from  138 
institutional investors from across the world, and the spread was 
the lowest level among three-year bonds issued by Korean banks 
since the financial crisis of 2008. We completed the sustainability

KB Kookmin Bank declared the “Digital Transformation” initiative 
in 2018 to survive in an era where traditional industry boundaries 
are collapsed and competition in the digital finance is fiercer. It 
leads our employees to shift their mindset and work process to 
digital perspective, and to secure powerful executive ability. Interms of labor structure, we expanded “ACE Organization” – an 
agile and flexible group focusing on targeted projects- throughout 
the company and opened year-round employment for digital-
experts to secure competitive edge. In the service aspect, we 
focused on competitiveness of the service itself by improving on 
the fundamentals to enhance the customer convenience.KB Kookmin Bank removed the number of app subscribers from 
KPI and replaced with MAU (monthly active user) as a new 
indicator of the business to seek qualitative growth. We launched 
“Star CMS” to provide a free corporate capital management 
service and “Liiv Talk Talk” to reinforce one-stop financial service 
through interactive banking platform. We also transplanted 
authentication and scanning app in “Star Banking” –our main 
banking platform. All these results are the effort of providing user-
friendly platform and improving the service to enhance greater 
values of our customers.
 
Obtaining Patents on Interactive Financial Platform 
Using Messenger
“Liiv  Talk  Talk”,  our  interactive  banking  platform,  allows 
customers  to  access  banking  service  via  self-developed 
messenger “Talk Talk” as if the customer is talking to banking 
tellers instead of going through numerous steps. KB obtained a 
patent of this technology in recognition of its innovativeness. “Liiv 
Talk Talk” features ‘Zero UI’ where customers can access financial 
service via chatting window instead of going through steps of 
menu pages. It also allows one-stop financial service through 
interactive communication. Users can view transaction history 
and access services like money transfer, fund subscription, and 
loan maturity extension just by chatting to “Talk Talk” itself. 
We plan to implant AI chatbot and enhance the information 
notification service to develop the platform as a smart financial 
secretary. We also plan to open the messenger to subsidiaries 
and business partners to create a business model that provides 
more information and benefits to our customers.
 
Upgrading KB Star Banking and Personal Internet 
Banking Services
In a bid to bring new experience to KB Star Banking, we introduced 
simple layout and emotional design, taking user convenience to 
the next level regarding the frequently accessed services such 
as view, transfer, log in, and home. Key upgrades are as follows: 
integrating bio-authentication and ID card scan apps; skipping 
security media (security card and OTP) check when verifying 
fingerprints;  simplifying  transaction  process  by  separating 
information submission step from verification step when sending 
money; forming customer-tailored home screen available for 
flexible configuration; and enhancing search function.Meanwhile, we updated personal Internet banking service, 
so that it is as convenient to use as mobile environment and 
ensures faster and easier financial service. Key improvements 
are ① integrating 34% of existing menus by analyzing customer 
behavior patterns, ② improving the financial product section 
such as concentration of financial products and visualization of 
product information, ③ enhancing user convenience through 
organic connection with KB Star Banking (log-in through mobile 
certification, connection with subscription process, opening 
account, report, and realization of real name certification, and more).

We newly organized the Digital Task Force dedicated to identifying 
core digital technologies and improving work efficiency, and 
innovating customer experience in January 2018. In a bid tomaximize convenience for customers visiting branch offices, we 
endeavored to optimize counter process by introducing tablet 
PCs and creating a paperless environment based on e-document 
solution. Moreover, the introduction of RPA (Robotic Process 
Automation) system to 76 kinds of branch works contributed to 
automizing simple repetitive works and reducing an average of 
50 working hours a day. On top of that, we have developed our 
financial services including opening account based on Open API 
to promote partnership with external fintech services. Now a non-
face-to-face discretionary investment service application is under 
development in association with a top-ranking robo-advisor firm. 
Going forward, more partnerships with startups and fintech firms 
will be promoted to create differentiated customer value.
 
Exceeding KRW 1.3 Trillion in Sales of the KB able

a discretionary asset management service that invests in 
a portfolio of different assets, such as ELS, bonds, funds, 
alternative investment products, as well as stocks using a single

Valuable Performances in Overseas Business
With the aim of growing into Asia’s leading financial company 
beyond the domestic market, KB Securities had acquired a local 
securities firm in Vietnam in 2017 and officially launched the “KB 
Securities Vietnam Joint Stock Company” in January 2018. As part 
of localization and stable business operation, we appointed a local 
expert to the CEO while transferring management capabilities 
on risk management, governance restructuring, Korea Desk 
operation, IB, and S&T. In June 2018, we opened the Vietnamese 
online securities trading platform, giving Korean investors extended 
investment opportunities. Capital increase worth KRW 70 billion was 
also conducted to shape our position as a comprehensive securities 
firm leading the Vietnamese financial market. We are prepared to 
diversify business portfolio to ensure that the subsidiary will become 
a hub of the emerging market in Southeast Asia.
 
Enhancing Awareness and Reliability
As a mage-sized IB firm, KB Securities demonstrates extensive 
awareness  and  reliability  on  its  distinct  competence  and 
differentiated services. For example, we won the grand prize 
in customer satisfaction in finance and securities category for 
12 years in a row, institutional award in financial consumer 
protection category by the Financial Supervisory Service, and 
an award in DCM category for Korean IBs for four consecutive 
years, proving our excellence in the IB business once again. 
In the latter half of 2018, international credit rating agencies 
S&P and Fitch assigned A-, an investment grade rating, to KB

ISO27001 and domestic standard ISMS, certificates obtained 
in 2017 for the purpose of customer privacy protection, on a 
regular basis, ensuring reliable financial service and competitive 
sales capabilities both at home and abroad.Focusing on customer-centric 
asset management serviceKBable AccountThe balance of our integrated assetmanagement platform KB able Accountstood at KRW 1.3 trillion at the endof 2018, just in a year and half.Market Outlook and Our Plans in 2019It is anticipated that the domestic economy will continue to 
struggle with the slowing recovery amid the protracted sluggish 
growth of the global economy and prolonged U.S-China trade 
conflict. However, we expect real economy to improve as 
uncertainties will likely ease in the second half of the year. It is 
not easy to see a strong rally in the domestic market in 2019 due 
to slowdown of economic growth rate and dwindling corporate 
revenue. Meanwhile, given that the U.S is likely to control interest 
rate hike policy, pressure on interest rate hike in the domestic market 
will moderate to an extent. Intensifying competition in the non-
face-to-face and digital services requires us to further sharpen 
competitiveness. However, it is positive that the government strives 
to cultivate capital market, discover new growth businesses, and 
encourage free competition. In response, KB Securities will focus 
on leveling up competitiveness in each business in consideration 
of macroeconomic environment and competition condition in the 
financial industry, thereby evolving into top-tier securities firm with 
the most valuable business portfolio. As for major strategies by 
each business, we will push ahead with the “WM Transformation” 
to secure industry-leading customer management asset volume 
in the WM business. To that end, we will reinforce sales capabilities 
in asset management, lay a firm foundation for global brokerage 
business, and strengthen market positioning by providing diverse 
financial products meeting consumer needs. S&T business division 
will endeavor to establish a unique S&T business model to ensure 
stable revenue and play a pivotal role as the “Product Factory.” By 
doing so, we will continue to develop products targeting global 
market and sophisticate IT platforms for sales expansion.Our IB business division will concentrate capabilities on diversifying 
the scope of investment assets and expanding global network 
in order to build stable revenue-creation portfolio and securing 
the leading position in Southeast Asian market, respectively. For 
areas where we enjoy competitive edge, on the other hand, we will 
further solidify our market dominance while making up on new or 
vulnerable areas for market status enhancement. In the wholesale 
business, we will overhaul sales infrastructure and enhance total 
solution to shape our position as the “WS Top BK House.” Other 
strategies aimed at securing future growth engines include the 
advancement of sales competence and the WS Trading Platform 
and phased expansion of the OCIO business.In the global business, we will grow the size of overseas subsidiary 
and promote partnership with local financial firms to secure 
wider business platform and coverage. Furthermore, in response 
to rapidly-changing business environment, we will be proactive 
in offering customer-centric digital financial solutions, thereby 
pursuing the increase of market share in the non-face-to-face 
channel and profitability.050 OPERATION REVIEWUp32.4 %Revenue from the direct CMchannel in car insurance jumped

KB Insurance has laid the foundation for synergy creation by 
boosting interaction among planner channel of affiliates, vitalizing 
their infrastructure, and raising employee awareness of synergy. 
The encouragement of selling affiliates’ products to planners 
resulted in them making more earnings and increasing cross-
selling performance. The number of new insurance subscribers 
grew 27.1% from the previous year to 13,500 accounts and life 
insurance product sales also rose 10.8% to KRW 0.9 trillion (based 
on CMIP). In addition, the Company carried out activities to 
seek win-win relations with affiliates, including payment account 
campaign and Magic Car loan recommendation. We also launched 
four GAs by capitalizing on corporate loan agents of KR Kookmin 
Bank and established a process to introduce corporate insurance 
products to the Bank’s branches, thereby further enhancing 
cross-selling infrastructure. The results were attributable to efforts 
made by employees committed to synergy generation activities. 
The Company also encouraged them to further participate in 
synergy creation through company-wide communication, reward 
system, and bulletin board.
 
General Insurance
The general insurance market volume in 2018 stood at KRW 5.8 
trillion, up by 1.2% from the previous year. The domestic market 
grew 1.9% year-on-year to KRW 5.5 trillion, while overseas market 
fell by 7.3% to KRW 411.4 billion. Our operating revenue in 2018increased 1.7% from the previous year to KRW 931.7 billion. Loss 
ratio decreased 0.3%p on the strength of our efforts to increase 
retention rate and prevent high damage accidents, despite larger-
than-expected natural disasters abroad including wild fires in the 
U.S. and typhoon in China. In addition, our continued efforts on 
cutting down on operation expenses have caused aggregate ratio 
to drop by 4.1%p and operating profit to jump by KRW 21.1 billion 
year-on-year.
 
Long-term Insurance
The long-term insurance market in 2018 grew by 2.6% compared 
with the previous year due to the launch of dental insurance and 
insurance products with no termination refund and increased 
number of planners in response to fierce competition in protection 
insurance (17.1% in terms of monthly payment of protection 
insurance). We have continued to increase sales of 10-year 
maturity and renewable products since 2017 and to diversify 
portfolio. As a result, the ratio of new sales of 10-year maturity 
and renewable products in 2018 was 74.6%, the highest level in 
the industry. Also, by diversifying the existing portfolio from adult 
and children’s general health insurance into special sectors such as 
driver, property, and dental insurances, we succeeded in reducing 
long-term risk and maximizing new subscription values. However, 
our market share in new protection insurance sales decreased 
0.6%p year-on-year due to the absence of insurance products 
with no termination refund of low profitability in the process of 
product restructuring. Thus, we plan to focus on enhancing market 
status in 2019. Operating revenue from long-term insurance inKB Financial Group  Annual Report 20180512018 stood at KRW 299.8 billion, down by 29.1% from the previous 
year. The slowdown of revenue, as a universal phenomenon in 
the industry, is mainly attributable to the decrease of risk ratio 
margin caused by increase in sales expense in terms of protection 
insurance and the rise in loss ratio of affordable health insurance.
 
Car Insurance
Even though the number of cars registered rose 3.0% in 2018, 
premium written in the domestic car insurance market decreased 0.9% 
year-on-year to 16.7 trillion mainly due to premium rate cut. Direct 
channel posted a 6.2% growth, or KRW 6.3 trillion from the previous 
year, and accounted for 37.8% of total premium written, an increase 
of 2.5%p from 35.3% in 2017. Our operating revenue fell 3.0% year-
on-year to KRW 2.4 trillion while market share recorded 12.2%, down 
0.3%p compared to a year before, while achieving 32.4% growth to 
KRW 328.0 billion in revenue from direct CM channel. Loss ratio in 
2018 was 88.3%, an increase of 7.6%p from the previous year.
 
Asset Management 
Investment profit in 2018 fell by KRW 3.4 billion from the previous 
year to KRW 784.3 billion and return on asset was 3.0%. Assets 
under management stood at KRW 27.3 trillion, up 8.8% year-on-
year. The asset management division focused on responding to 
tightened capital market regulations such as the introduction of 
K-ICS, extending asset duration through purchase of long-term 
bonds, and reducing risk assets, thus contributing to easing the 
burden of capital requirement. This strategy resulted in extending 
asset duration by 0.3 to 8.9 compared to the previous year, 
increasing the proportion of interest-bearing assets by 0.8%p 
to 92.5%, and reducing the proportion of risk assets by 0.8%p 
to 7.5%. We also enhanced investments in profitable real estate 
and SOC-related projects in response to declining rate of return 
due to the increase in the share of long-term risk-free bonds. As 
a result, our alternative investment asset in 2018 accounted for 
18.9% (KRW 8.8 trillion), up 2.5%p from a year before.Risk Management 
The RBC ratio in 2018 was 187.3%, down 3.4%p year-on-year, on 
a non-consolidated basis, due to increase in capital requirement 
and slowing growth of available capital guided by changes in RBC 
criteria. It was 187.1% on a consolidated basis. In preparation for 
increasing uncertainties both at home and abroad and tightening 
regulations on insurance business, we have strived to make risk 
management system rooted in the company-wide decision-
making process. For example, the “Risk Management Council” 
have been convened every month to discuss risk management 
status and major issues, and the Product Deliberation Committee, 
Interest Rate Deliberation Committee, and Asset Management 
Deliberation Committee have practical and in-depth discussion 
on key issues in terms of new product development in the fieldsof general, long-term, car, and retirement pension insurances. 
Moreover, we have applied two-tier limit management process 
guided by RBC criteria and the Group’s internal capital criteria, 
and established infrastructure and process to set a 3-tier limit 
management system based on internal model.
 
Improving Customer Convenience
KB Insurance delivers differentiated customer experience through 
digital innovation. As the leader of insure-tech, we launched the 
industry-first “easy premiums claim service,” “mobile registered 
mail service,” and “smart scrapping service” in 2018, showcasing 
how digital innovation takes customer convenience to next 
level. Going forward, KB Insurance will continue to build the 
digital ecosystem in partnership with promising startups and 
ICT companies with the aim of providing customers with more 
differentiated and convenient services in the digital environment.Market Outlook and Our Plans in 2019The domestic insurance market is expected to face big changes 
such as intensive competition centered on GA channel, increasing 
volatility of interest and foreign exchange rate, emergence of 
first-ever digital insurance firms, and rapid digitalization in financial 
industry. In response, KB Insurance will pursue the following 
strategies to deliver customer-centric values.In the general insurance business, we will focus on securing stable 
revenue creation structure by increasing new sales of property and 
compensation liability insurances with high profitability through 
corporate sales channel and at the same time, vitalizing planner, 
agent, and direct channels to expand small and mid-sized new 
contracts. We will strengthen joint sales with affiliates to maximize 
synergy while solidifying sales foundation by forming new teams, 
revamping sales organization, and developing strategic products.
In the long-term insurance business, we will continue to provide 
customer-centric products by identifying new markets and 
enhancing the function of market research, solidifying our market 
leadership. Other focuses will be on building an early detection 
system on moral hazard, redefining underwriting standards to 
cope with market changes, stabilizing loss ratio through enhancing 
expertise in compensation, and systematically managing existing 
contracts. The car insurance division intends to prepare and 
practice various counterplans in response to adverse business 
cycle. Those include proactive pricing policy such as premium 
rate increase, improving compensation productivity including staff 
restructuring, and digitalization for reducing expenses. Moreover, 
we will help customers ensure better digital accessibility to 
our services and reinforce supports for field sales by improving 
mileage special contract subscription process and establishing the 
electronic approval system on mobile application.052 OPERATION REVIEWUp10.4 %The amount of credit card

KB Kookmin Card officially launched the KB Daehan Specialized 
Bank Plc., a local subsidiary in Cambodia we had jointly acquired 
with “LVMC Holdings (formerly KOLAO Holdings)” in September 
2018, announcing the entrance into the global market. KB Daehan 
Specialized Bank Plc. started auto financing for cars produced by 
LVMC Holdings and mortgage loans. In the long term, the local 
subsidiary will expand its business area to credit card, installment 
finance for durables, credit loan, and card processing agency 
business while opening offices starting with major hub cities. We 
plan to launch customized financial products in cooperation with 
affiliates which are currently operating in Cambodia and Southeast 
Asian countries such as KB Kookmin Bank and KB Securities, thus 
introducing model products aimed at exploring overseas markets.
 
Launching “KB Kookmin Credit Loan”
We launched the “KB Kookmin Credit Loan,” a mid-range interest 
rate loan, in order to help ease interest burden on low-income 
people and contribute to realizing the Government’s policy goals 
of inclusive finance. Designed based on big data analysis on credit 
assessment model and the Company’s proven risk management 
expertise, the product comes with lowered interest rate compared 
to existing long-term card credit (card loan). The product targets 
customers with mid-level credit ratings and small business owners 
who do not have credit cards. KB Kookmin Card will continue toshowcase products and services which can ease interest burden 
on working classes.The Highest Credit Rating in the Industry for Two 
Consecutive Years
KB Kookmin Card has received “A-“ grade on long-term credit 
rating from Fitch, one of the three major credit rating agencies, 
for two years in a row and “Stable” grade on its credit prospects, 
maintaining the highest level among those of the domestic credit-
specialized financial firms. This result was mainly attributable 
to KB Kookmin Card’s excellence in management performance 
and contributions to the Group’s synergy creation as a main 
subsidiary. Fitch also highly recognized for our steadfast asset 
growth and market share increase despite both external and 
internal management challenges posed by cut in merchant fee 
rates. KB Kookmin Card became the first company to obtain the 
high-level international credit rating on corporate value instead of 
the purpose of overseas bond issuance from global credit rating 
agencies for two consecutive years. Given that local financial 
authorities require international credit ratings for overseas 
operation permission, we expect that this achievement will make 
great contribution to us entering overseas markets and raising 
foreign funds in a stable manner going forward.

than ever before throughout 2019. The Government’s policy to 
lower merchant fee, regulations on the gross amount of card 
finance, and emergence of competitors such as Zero Pay will 
pose grave threats to the card industry in general. Faced with the 
challenges, however, KB Kookmin Card is determined to turn crisis 
into opportunity and pursue the following three management 
strategies:First, we will sophisticate all our business areas to ensure internal

a joint big data research center for big data convergence and 
academia-industry collaboration. The Lab is open to anyone who 
wants to develop new business models through data analysis and 
convergence. A total of 24 colleges and companies are joining the 
Lab, including KB Kookmin Card. We plan to attract more private 
businesses and public organizations interested in big data industry.

The Company showcased two digital consulting service apps 
“Simple Review Talk” and “Limit Increase Talk” which allow users 
to require card issuance and credit limit increase via mobile 
chatting app without phone calls to counselors. Customers can

properties in March to reinforce the competence in remaining valuemanagement. Sales from the direct online channel increased on 
the back of active collaboration with external platform providers.

As a result, the VNB (value of new business) reached KRW 23.8 
billion, an increase of KRW 3.3 billion from originally planned. ROE 
was 2.7%, exceeding the planned target by 0.8%p. In addition, the

We focused on diversifying the portfolio of protection/variable 
insurance products, sharpening competitiveness of online products 
and so forth by analyzing customer segment and targeting 
customer database. Thereby, the Company advanced a scheme 
to set up the product lineup by channel. It also strengthened

Response to Changes in the Regulatory Environment
A task force team is running to build infrastructure and manage-
ment system in response to the introduction of IFRS17. Currently, 
advance preparation is underway. In order to respond to the new 
Korean-insurance Capital Standard (K-ICS), we established the 
SAA in consideration of the interest rate risk internal model ALM 
and built a market risk management system. We strive to minimize 
the impact of IFRS17 and K-ICS on the company.
 
Laying the Foundation for Digitalization
Our efforts for digitalization have been made to realize RPA-
based business automation, build a mobile application system, and 
introduce platforms for big data analysis. Now we are dedicated 
to developing new business model reflecting the “InsurTech” 
initiative to secure future growth engines.A slowdown in the life insurance market is expected due to 
the prolonged low-growth trend, market saturation, and other 
institutional factors. For protection insurance, the growth trend 
of premium written is likely to be further sluggish as the market 
has matured and the government's health insurance policy is still 
uncertain. Savings insurance market is likely to be on a decline as 
well, amid growing concerns over capital volatility under IFRS17, 
shrinking tax incentives, and lowered sales incentives due to a 
changed commission system.On top of this, potential legal and institutional changes for 
financial consumer protection will make the insurance business 
environment unfavorable. Meanwhile, the fourth Industrial 
Revolution is shifting the paradigm of insurance business. 
Convergence of traditional finance and new technology is 
being accelerated and competition in new services and product 
development is very intensive. In response, KB Life Insurance 
intends to pursue the following strategies:First, the Company will strengthen customer analysis capabilities 
and strive to ensure that the customer-centric products and 
channel strategies are operated. Second, we will improve the 
return on investment assets and enhance the efficiency in sales 
and management activities to establish the value-oriented 
growth foundation. Third, digitalization will be promoted across 
entire management activities including customer analysis, product 
development, sales, and customer service. Particularly, we will 
focus on RPA-driven operation efficiency, digital-based marketing 
& sales model development, and customer-centric product 
development. Lastly, in preparation for a growing volatility in 
assets, capital, and profitability under the IFRS 17, we continue to 
strengthen monitoring and continue to operate a TFT. Preemptive 
management plans against the K-ICS will also be prepared.In 2019, KB Life Insurance will spare no effort to deliver innovation

Government’s price stabilization policies, measures regarding 
household  borrowings,  decline  in  housing  construction 
permissions and licenses, and rise in housing supply, KB Real 
Estate Trust carried out proactive sales activities, for example, by 
winning the completion guarantee management land trust project 
based on the Company’s credibility, thus seeing commission 
income grow by 47.2% year-on-year to KRW 10.6 billion.

thus winning low-risk valuable leveraged land trust projects.The REITs business division launched a variety of large-scale REITs 
including a public housing project in Jangwi-dong, large discount 
stores, and retail stores. We also purchased the Knowledge 
Industry Center in Yongin and prime-class office buildings in 
Gangnam, diversifying the scope of investment properties.In the reconstruction sector, the company signed an MOU 
for trust-type reconstruction project on Jangmi Apartment in 
Seongsu-dong and Hanyang Apartment in Yeouido, Seoul. We 
have also been proactive in bidding activities such as proposals 
on reconstruction of valuable sites and promotion of seminars.Major activities for risk management included the establishment 
of preemptive risk response process, regular monitoring of limit 
runout rate, checks of major issues of constructors, and monthly 
investigation of construction progress.The real estate market in 2019 will likely remain sluggish with 
negative outlook over economic conditions in general due to the 
downward economy and dwindling population. Market competition 
is anticipated to be intensive due to the emergence of new trust 
firms and changes in management structure of existing trust 
companies. In response to these challenges, KB Real Estate Trust 
will focus on profit-centered management and stable projects 
management.First,  we  will  upgrade  our  risk  management  capability  by 
conducting pre-inspections on new project sites, sophisticating bid 
limit and capital management, and strengthening the authority of 
the Risk Management Council to preemptively check the progress 
level by each stage of projects.
Second,  we  will  strive  to  maintain  our  market  share  by 
reinforcing sales competitiveness despite the emergence of 
new competitors in the market. This strategy will be managed 
by pushing ahead with low-risk projects, selectively winning 
valuable  projects,  and  reinforcing  sales  and  marketing 
competitiveness in management trust.
Third, for urban reconstruction projects, we will focus on stable 
project management and selective participation in profitable 
reconstruction projects and agency-driven trust-type projects.
Fourth,  we  will  seek  stable  management  of  REITs  and 
diversification of investment portfolio. Major tasks in the REITs 
business are set at increasing customer satisfaction by stable REITs 
operation, maintaining leading market position by launching new 
products such as public offering REITs, improving systems aimed at 
enhancing profitability.

Collaboration  with  affiliates  and  expansion  of 
investment in startups
The domestic venture investment volume marked around KRW 
3.4 trillion, the largest-ever scale, in 2018 on the strength of the 
government’s endeavor to create a startup & venture ecosystem 
driven by the private sector. Newly raised venture funds amounted 
to KRW 4.7 trillion, record-high in the business history, in 2018. 
As 12 new venture capitals joined the market and the number 
of venture funds newly launched was record high, competition 
in funding and identifying deals was very fierce. Amid those 
challenges, KB Investment sought to reinforce collaboration with 
affiliates, raise major venture funds, and enhance investment and 
nurturing investment capabilities in new growth businesses and 
startups. Major achievements in each sector are as follows:˙ For major fund, KB Investment organized the KB DigitalInnovation Investment Fund Limited Partnership worth KRW 
136 billion, investing in the 4th Industrial Revolution relatedbusinesses. We also raised KRW 40 billion worth of KB IP 
Investment Fund II, investing in IP and TCB evaluation assets.˙We raised KRW 5 billion in cooperation with KB Securities andKB Asset Management to provide the Group’s PB customers 
with KB Pre-IPO Secondary Venture Fund II as venture fund

billion in 2018. New investment within the initial five years or 
earlier grew 147.7% from KRW 28.3 billion in 2017 to KRW 
70.1 billion in 2018. Seed and Series A investment rose from 
KRW 20.7 billion in 2017 to KRW 47.2 billion in 2018.Our venture fund AUM in 2018 increased by KRW 141.0 billion 
year-on-year to KRW 744.0 billion. New venture investment 
was valued at an all-time high of KRW 141.1 billion. Net profit 
in 2018  also recorded the largest-ever high KRW 15 billion 
on the strength of increased investment income in the new 
growth business sector including life science & healthcare.Market Outlook and Our Plans in 2019The domestic venture investment market seems to remain 
strong growth in 2019 on the strength of the government’s 
policy pursuing innovative growth. KB Investment aims to rise 
as top-tier venture capital within three years by continuously

the strength of extended investment in IT within the Group.
 
Development of and Support for Next-generation 
Systems of Affiliates
KB Data Systems has completed the establishment of KB 
Capital’s next-generation system in 2018. We also won the 
business support process development project of KB Kookmin 
Card and supported the development of next-generation 
systems of KB Kookmin Bank and KB Kookmin Card. Recent 
fierce competition with fintech firms and Internet-only banks 
has triggered demands for new technologies related to big 
data, AI, and block chain. In response, KB Data Systems has 
been proactive in supporting digital transformation strategy 
of the Group by participating in various IT projects of affiliates 
and establishing the Digital R&D Lab.We initiated the advancement of WiseNet (Group’s portal 
system)  and  development  of  the  Group-wide  IT  system 
(m-WiseNet). We also contributed to enhancing the Group’s 
ICT capabilities by operating the group portal and Open API. 
Our competence in IT operation service was further enhanced 
by receiving a certain portion of IT operation projects from 
affiliates. To meet the growing demand for IT operation and 
SI development projects within the Group, we increased the 
number of employees from 380 in the previous year to 413 
in 2018. Moreover, the scope of IT operation supports was 
extended to non-banking affiliates such as KB Securities, KB 
Insurance, and KB Kookmin Card.Enhancement of Sale Capability and IT Service Quality
The company launched the Strategic Business division and 
strived to advance the quality of SI & SM services. By doing 
so, our service quality in the SI development project has been

Maximization of Sales Competence by Business Unit
KB  Credit  Information  has  set  promotional  goals  for  KB 
Kookmin  Bank  and  KB  Kookmin  Card  to  maximize  credit 
collection performance within the Group. For example, we were 
commissioned to handle credit recovery applicants from KB 
Kookmin Card, which ensured quarterly sales of KRW 125 million. 
Total amount of retrieved debts within the Group reached KRW 
320.3 billion, an increase of KRW 14.1 billion year-on-year, and 
commission revenue from the Group also rose by KRW 4.3 billion 
to KRW 34.5 billion in 2018. Major performances in debt collection 
included KRW 138.9 billion for KB Kookmin Bank, KRW 174.6 
billion for KB Kookmin Card, KRW 3.2 billion for KB Capital, and 
KRW 0.42 billion for KB Savings Bank.We have also continued to hire professional debt collectors to 
improve the competence in our main business, which resulted in 
increasing debt collection rate and commission revenue.In the lease investigation business, we raised the delivery rate of 
general and emergency projects by improving work efficiency and 
ensuring real-time review process. Revenue generated from the 
Group projects was around KRW 8 billion. We make contribution 
to enhancing the Group’s asset soundness through nation-wide 
network, real-time work handling, and strict inspection.
 
Enhancement of Organization and Staff Productivity
We  sought  stabilization  regarding  the  dualized  lease 
investigation  operation.  As  a  result,  service  satisfaction 
improved through work separation regarding reference review 
process by employees, emergency investigation handling, 
and discussion on customer supports. We also continued to 
focus on enhancing the efficiency in cost control as well asorganization and staff operation. Reorganization was completed 
and cost control was conducted by an automated system, 
resulting in reducing 7.9% in labor cost and 15.8% in furniture 
& equipment expense compared with annual budget plans.Market Outlook and Our Plans in 2019Macroeconomic outlook for 2019 presented by economic 
research  institutes  at  home  and  abroad  is  not  favorable. 
To  begin  with  the  economic  environment  surrounding  KB 
Credit Information, the upward trend in household debts has 
eased slightly but there are still concerns over the possible 
deterioration in the debt repayment ability among speculative 
and Ponzi borrowers. While the delinquency rate of household 
debts at financial institutions remains at the minimum, concerns 
are mounting over increased uncertainties from both political 
and economical issues at home and abroad. Regarding policy 
and regulations, it is expected to become increasingly difficult 
to collect debts due to moral hazard and debtor representative 
system where debtors may reschedule debt repayment. Tightening 
housing loan regulations such as requirements on DSR may result 
in reduction of lease investigation orders.We plan to execute key business strategies in consideration of 
various political and economic variables. To begin with, we will 
reinforce business competence in the Group by additionally 
recruiting professional debt collectors, conducting joint debt 
collection promotion with affiliates, and sharing information on 
debt. Secondly, we will promote new projects such as managing 
debtors of KB Kookmin Card who have applied to credit recovery 
programs and on-the-spot survey of card member stores. 
Service quality improvement of lease investigation will also be 
implemented. The last strategy aims to improve the infrastructure 
for sustainable growth. To this end, we will pursue employee 
productivity  enhancement,  region-specific  business 
operation, and digital transformation such as building debt 
normalization model based on big data analysis.062 FINANCIAL SECTION063
284Consolidated Financial StatementsSeparate Financial StatementsOPERATION 
REVIEWKB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018063Independent Auditor’s Report(English Translation of a Report Originally Issued in Korean)To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of KB Financial Group Inc.Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of KB Financial Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the 
"Group"), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the consolidated statements of 
comprehensive income, consolidated statements of changes in equity and consolidated statements of cash flows for the years then ended, and notes 
to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
 
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the 
Group as at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the years then ended in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the Republic of Korea (Korean IFRS).
 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audits in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in 
accordance with the ethical requirements of the Republic of Korea that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
 
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
 
1. Expected Credit Losses on Loans Measured at Amortized Cost
 
Why it is determined to be a key audit matter :
Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments, which has been applied on January 1, 2018 by the Group, is a more complex accounting standard which 
requires considerable amount of judgment and interpretation in its implementation than Korean IFRS 1039 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement, in relation to impairment. This new standard especially requires determination of significant increases in credit risk and measurement 
of expected credit losses using forward-looking information. Accordingly the Group developed a new measurement model utilizing various types of 
information.The Group measures expected credit losses on loans measured at amortized cost, on an individual or collective basis. The identification of loans 
that are deteriorating and the assessment of the present value of expected future cash flows in determining expected credit losses are inherently 
uncertain, involving various assumptions and judgments. In measuring expected losses on a collective basis, a wide range of complex inputs and 
assumptions are used. Given the extent of judgment involved, we considered expected credit losses to be a key audit matter.The balances of loans measured at amortized cost subject to individual or collective assessment and loss allowance are ₩ 321,811,284 million and 
₩ 2,609,681 million, respectively(See Note 4-2, 10, 11). Significantly affected subsidiaries include Kookmin Bank, KB Kookmin Card and others.064 FINANCIAL SECTIONHow our audit addressed the key audit matter :(1) Assessment of expected credit losses on an individual basis
We obtained an understanding and evaluated procedures and controls relating to the assessment of expected credit losses on an individual basis. 
In particular, we focused our effort on the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows. We evaluated whether management’s estimation was 
reasonable and sufficiently reviewed over key assumptions in cash flow projection including growth rate of entities subject to individual assessment 
and  valuation  of  collateral.  As  part  of  these  procedures,  we  assessed  whether  sales  growth  rate,  operating  income  ratio,  and  assumptions  on 
investment activities were consistent with historical performance and current market conditions. Furthermore, we challenged appropriateness of 
collateral valuation by conducting our own research on most recent property prices and engaging independent appraisal specialists in verifying 
appraisal reports, models and methodologies employed by management.(2) Assessment of expected credit losses on a collective basis
We obtained an understanding and evaluated the processes and controls relating to the assessment of expected credit losses on a collective basis in 
accordance with impairment requirements under Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments. As explained in Note 2, management assesses credit rating 
to recognize lifetime expected credit losses on loans with significant increase in credit risk and impaired loans. Other than these cases, management 
recognizes 12 month expected credit losses. To calculate expected credit losses, management has applied forward-looking information, probability 
of default, and loss given default estimated through predetermined internal procedures and controls implemented for various assumptions.
 
We assessed design and tested operating effectiveness of controls relating to credit ratings that appropriately capture both qualitative and quantitative 
information. Our substantive test over accuracy and reliability of the information included agreeing qualitative and quantitative information with 
relevant evidence. 
 
We assessed appropriateness of management accounting policy determining significant increase in credit risk. We confirmed management reasonably 
performed allocation of Stage 1, 2 and 3 depending on how significantly credit risk was increased and used different models for each stage. We 
verified that these procedures were performed in accordance with the policy and examined appropriateness of the results. 
 
We involved our own risk specialist to statistically analyze correlation between forward-looking information and probability of defaults and loss 
given default. We assessed appropriateness of methodologies for adjusting probability of defaults and loss given default to reflect forward-looking 
information  on  estimation  of  expected  credit  losses.  We  further  tested  reasonableness  and  mathematical  accuracy  of  the  information  through 
recalculation and inspection of supporting data.
 
We  challenged  methodologies  used  by  management  to  verify  that  probability  of  default  and  loss  given  default  were  calibrated  using  sufficient 
and reasonable historical data. We determined that the default and loss data used were appropriately gathered and applied in accordance with 
internal control procedures. In addition, we verified reasonableness and accuracy of probability of defaults and losses through procedures including 
recalculation, and evaluated management’s default and loss data. 
 
2. Valuation of over-the-counter derivatives
 
Why it is determined to be a key audit matter :
Fair value of large portion of over-the-counter derivatives in the consolidated financial statements is calculated through in-house valuation system. 
Judgment is required in estimating the fair value of these derivatives held by KB Securities in determining appropriate models, assumptions and inputs. 
Given the extent of judgment involved in valuing these over-the-counter derivatives, we considered this to be a key audit matter. Over-the-counter 
derivatives of KB securities subject to fair value measurement amount to ₩ 14,551,811 million including financial liabilities designated as at fair value 
through profit or loss relevant to structured securities and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss(See Note 6,12,19). 
 
How our audit addressed the key audit matter :We obtained an understanding and evaluated process and relevant controls in relation to fair value measurement. Our focus was particularly on the 
accuracy of underlying transaction data used and mathematical calculation in accordance with management’s in-house valuation methodologies.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018065We assessed design and tested operating effectiveness of controls over accuracy and completeness of key inputs such as underlying transaction 
data(notional amount, interest rate, maturity etc.) employed in management’s in-house valuation system. We substantively tested transaction data 
used in valuation by examining supporting evidence including contracts and trade confirmations. 
 
We  also  evaluated  design  and  tested  operating  effectiveness  of  controls  over  periodic  verification  of  in-house  valuation  system  to  ensure  the 
valuation methodologies configured in the system were accurately operating as intended. We involved our own derivative valuation specialist to 
independently estimate fair values utilizing independent valuation models and variables to see if management’s valuation is outside our ranges.
 
Other Matter
Auditing standards and their application in practice vary among countries. The procedures and practices used in the Republic of Korea to audit such 
consolidated financial statements may differ from those generally accepted and applied in other countries.
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Korean IFRS, and 
for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations. 
 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.
 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
 
As  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  Korean  Standards  on  Auditing,  we  exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional  skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:˙ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and performaudit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.˙Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, butnot for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control.˙Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and  related  disclosures  made  bymanagement.˙Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.066 FINANCIAL SECTION˙Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether theconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.˙Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express anopinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, 
and  to  communicate  with  them  all  relationships  and  other  matters  that  may  reasonably  be  thought  to  bear  on  our  independence,  and  where 
applicable, related safeguards.
 
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report 
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

KB Financial Group Inc. (the “Parent Company”) was incorporated on September 29, 2008, under the Financial Holding Companies Act of Korea.  KB 
Financial Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Group”) derive substantially all of their revenue and income from providing 
a broad range of banking and related financial services to consumers and corporations primarily in Korea and in selected international markets. The 
Parent Company’s principal business includes ownership and management of subsidiaries and associated companies that are engaged in financial 
services or activities. In 2011, Kookmin Bank spun off its credit card business segment and established a new separate credit card company, KB

in January 2012, acquired Yehansoul Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in September 2013, and KB Savings Bank Co., Ltd. merged with Yehansoul Savings Bank 
Co., Ltd. in January 2014. In March 2014, the Group acquired Woori Financial Co., Ltd. and changed the name to KB Capital Co., Ltd.  Meanwhile, 
the Group included LIG Insurance Co., Ltd. as an associate and changed the name to KB Insurance Co., Ltd. in June 2015. Also, the Group 
included Hyundai Securities Co., Ltd. as an associate in June 2016 and included as a subsidiary in October 2016 by comprehensive exchange of 
shares. Hyundai Securities Co., Ltd. merged with KB Investment & Securities Co., Ltd. in December 2016 and changed the name to KB Securities 
Co., Ltd. in January 2017. KB Insurance Co., Ltd. became one of the subsidiaries through a tender offer in May 2017.
 
The Parent Company’s share capital as of December 31, 2018, is ₩ 2,090,558 million. The Parent Company has been listed on the Korea Exchange 
(“KRX”) since October 10, 2008, and on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) for its American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) since September 29, 
2008. Number of shares authorized in its Articles of Incorporation is 1,000 million.2. Basis of Preparation
 
2.1 Application of Korean IFRS
 
The Group maintains its accounting records in Korean won and prepares statutory financial statements in the Korean language (“Hangeul”) in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the Republic of Korea (“Korean IFRS”). The accompanying consolidated 
financial statements have been condensed, restructured and translated into English from the Korean language financial statements. 
 
Certain information attached to the Korean language financial statements, but not required for a fair presentation of the Group's financial position, 
financial performance or cash flows, is not presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Korean IFRS. These are the standards, subsequent 
amendments and related interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") that have been adopted by the Republic 
of Korea.
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. Management also needs to exercise 
judgment in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions 
and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 2.4.The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual reporting period commencing January 1, 
2018. The adoption of these amendments did not have any significant impact on the current period or any prior period and is not likely to affect 
future periods, with the exception of the application of Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments and IFRS 1115 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers discussed below.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018075- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1028 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
 
Amendments to Korean IFRS 1028 clarifies that a venture capital organization or a mutual fund, and similar entities may elect, at initial recognition, 
to measure investments in an associate or joint venture at fair value through profit or loss separately for each associate or joint venture.
 
- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1040 Transfers of Investment Property
 
Amendments to Korean IFRS 1040 clarifies that a transfer to, or from, investment property, including property under construction, can only be 
made if there has been a change in use that is supported by evidence. Paragraph 57 of the standard provides a list of such circumstances as 
examples.  
 
- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1102 Share-based PaymentAmendments to Korean IFRS 1102 clarifies accounting for a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the 
classification of the transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled. Also, it clarifies that the measurement approach should treat the terms and 
conditions of a cash-settled award in the same way as for an equity-settled award.
 
- Enactment of Korean IFRS 2122 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration
 
According to the enacted interpretation, the date of the transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition 
of the related asset, expense or income (or part thereof) is the date on which an entity initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-
monetary liability arising from the prepayment or receipt of advance consideration. In case there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the 
entity should determine a date of the transaction for each payment or receipt of advance consideration. 
 
- Korean IFRS 1109 Financial InstrumentsThe Group applied Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments with a date of initial application of January 1, 2018.  As permitted by the transition 
requirements of Korean IFRS 1109, comparative periods have not been restated. The Group recognized the difference between the previous 
carrying amount and the carrying amount at the beginning of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application in the opening 
retained earnings of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application. Also, the Group applied “The Overlay Approach” under 
Korean IFRS 1104 at the initial application of Korean IFRS 1109. For details about impacts of the adoption of this Korean IFRS, see Note 46.- Korean IFRS 1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 
The Group has applied Korean IFRS 1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. As permitted by the transition requirements of Korean IFRS 
1115, comparative periods have not been restated.  
 
For details about impacts of the application of this Korean IFRS, see Note 28 and 46.
 
The Group has changed the accounting policy for their annual reporting period commencing January 1, 2018.
 
- Presentation of interest income arising from financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
 
The Group previously recognized interest income arising from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as net gains (losses) on financial 
assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. From January 1, 2018, the Group 
changed the accounting policy, and corresponding interest income is presented as a portion of interest income in the consolidated statements of 
comprehensive income. The Group expects the change in accounting policy provides more relevant information.The consolidated statement of comprehensive income for year ended December 31, 2017, has been restated by adjusting classification of interest income.076 FINANCIAL SECTIONThe Group does not expect the change in accounting policy to have an impact on the consolidated statements of financial position, and total 
comprehensive income. The results and impact of the change on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 
December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:Increase in interest income
Decrease in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities 
    at fair value through profit or loss
Decrease in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities 
   at fair value through profit or loss (under Korean IFRS 1039)2018\748,360 \(748,360)-(In millions of Korean won)2017536,605-(536,605)Certain new accounting standards and interpretations that have been published that are not mandatory for annual reporting period commencing 
January 1, 2018 and have not been early adopted by the Group are set out below. The Group expects the effect on the financial statements 
applying the new standard will not be significant, with the exception of the adoption of Korean IFRS 1116 Lease.
 
- Korean IFRS 1116 Leases
 
Korean IFRS 1116 Leases issued on May 22, 2017 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption 
permitted. This standard will replace Korean IFRS 1017 Leases, Interpretation Korean IFRS 2104 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a 
Lease, Interpretation Korean IFRS 2015 Operating Leases-Incentives, and Interpretation Korean IFRS 2027 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions 
Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
 
At inception of a contract, the Group shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Also, at the date of initial application, the Group shall 
assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease in accordance with the standard. However, the Group may not need to reassess all contracts, if 
the Group elects to apply the practical expedient not to apply the standard to contracts that were entered into before the date of initial application. 
At inception of a contract, the Group will assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease.
 
For a contract that is, or contains, a lease, the Group shall account for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-
lease components of the contract. In addition, as a practical expedient, the lessee may elect, by class of underlying asset, not to separate non-
lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single 
lease component. For the all (or partial) lease agreements, or the agreements including lease components, the Group plans to apply the practical 
expedient to account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease agreement.
 
A lessee is required to recognize a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its 
obligation to make lease payments. The lessee may elect not to apply the requirements to short-term lease (a lease term of 12 months or less 
at the commencement date) and low value assets (e.g. underlying assets below $ 5,000). The Group plans not to apply the requirements to real 
estates rent for single-use (a lease for education and others) and low value assets (e.g. underlying assets below \ 5 million and $ 5,000).
 
In relation with sale and leaseback transactions, the Group(the seller-lessee) shall apply the requirements for determining when a performance 
obligation is satisfied in Korean IFRS 1115 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' to determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for 
as a sale of that asset. However, for those transactions before the date of initial application, the Group shall not reassess them.
 
The accounting treatment as a lessor did not change significantly from the one under Korean IFRS 1017 Leases. The Bank expects the effect on 
the financial statements applying the new standard will not be significant as accounting for the Bank, as a lessor, will not significantly change.
 
A lessee shall apply this standard to its leases either (a) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented applying Korean IFRS 1008 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors (Full retrospective application); or (b) retrospectively with the cumulative effect of 
initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application.
The Group plans to apply Korean IFRS 1116 retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard and as such will not restate 
any comparative information.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018077The Group performed an impact assessment to identify potential financial effects of applying Korean IFRS 1116 based on available information as 
at December 31, 2018 to identify effects on 2019 financial statements.
 
The total minimum lease payment expected to be paid by the Group in relation to operating leases before discounted to their present value is 
\ 591,190 million. When the payment is discounted at incremental borrowing rate of the lessee, the total minimum lease payment amounts to 
\ 550,322 million. As a result of the financial effects on the financial statements analyzed, the Group expects the underlying leased asset and a 
lease liability as at December 31, 2018 to be increased by \ 580,698 million and \ 550,322 million, respectively. The difference between the right-
of-use asset and the lease liability has been arising from the adjustments made at the right-of-use asset for the lease contracts entered before the 
date of the adoption of this standard. On the other hand, the results of the assessment may change due to additional information that the Group 
may obtain after the assessment.
 
Enactment, Amendments and Annual Improvements
 
- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments
 
The narrow-scope amendments made to Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments enable entities to measure certain prepayable financial assets 
with negative compensation at amortized cost. When a modification of a financial liability measured at amortized cost that does not result in 
derecognition, a modification gain or loss shall be recognized in profit or loss.
 
- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1019 Employee Benefits
 
The amendments require that an entity shall calculate current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the reporting period after a plan 
amendment, curtailment or settlement based on updated actuarial assumptions from the date of the change. The amendments also require that a 
reduction in a surplus must be recognized in profit or loss even if that surplus was not previously recognized because of the impact of the asset ceiling. 
 
- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1028 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
 
The amendments clarify that an entity shall apply Korean IFRS 1109 to financial instruments in an associate or joint venture to which the equity 
method is not applied. These include long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the entity’s net investment in an associate or joint venture. 
These amendments will be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In accordance with the 
transitional provisions in Korean IFRS 1109, the restatement of the comparative information is not required and the cumulative effects of initially 
applying the amendments retrospectively should be recognized in the beginning balance of retained earnings (or other components of equity, as 
appropriate) at the date of initial application.
 
- Enactment to Interpretation of Korean IFRS 2123 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
 
The enactment clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes in the event that the decision of taxation authorities or courts can change 
tax treatment.  The enactment presents calculating methods of disclosure amount based on the possibility of future recognition of the income tax 
treatment, and requires disclosure of the uncertainty of the amount.
 
- Annual Improvements to Korean IFRS 1103 Business Combination
 
The amendments clarify that when a party to a joint arrangement obtains control of a business that is a joint operation, and had rights to the assets 
and obligations for the liabilities relating to that joint operation immediately before the acquisition date, the transaction is a business combination 
achieved in stages. In such cases, the acquirer shall remeasure its entire previously held interest in the joint operation.
 
- Annual Improvements to Korean IFRS 1111 Joint Agreements
 
The amendments clarify that when a party that participates in, but does not have joint control of, a joint operation might obtain joint control of the078 FINANCIAL SECTIONjoint operation in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business. In such cases, previously held interests in the joint operation are 
not remeasured. 
 
- Annual Improvements to Paragraph 57A of Korean IFRS 1012 Income Tax
 
The amendment is applied to all the income tax consequences of dividends and requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of 
dividends in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity according to where the entity originally recognized those past transactions or 
events. 
 
- Annual Improvements to Korean IFRS 1023 Borrowing Cost
 
The amendments clarify that if a specific borrowing remains outstanding after the related qualifying asset is ready for its intended use (or sale), it 
becomes part of general borrowings.2.2 Measurement Basis
 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified.2.3 Functional and Presentation Currency 
 
Items included in the financial statements of each entity of the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Korean won, which is the Parent 
Company’s functional and presentation currency (Notes 3.2.1 and 3.2.2).2.4 Critical Accounting Estimates
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, certain critical accounting estimates and 
assumptions that may have a significant impact on the assets (liabilities) and incomes (expenses). Management’s estimates of outcomes may differ 
from actual outcomes if management’s estimates and assumptions based on management’s best judgment at the reporting date are different from 
the actual environment.
 
Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and any change in an accounting estimate is recognized prospectively by including it in profit 
or loss in the period of the change, if the change affects that period only. Alternatively if the change in accounting estimate affects both the period 
of change and future periods, that change is recognized in the profit or loss of all those periods.
 
Uncertainty in estimates and assumptions with significant risk that may result in material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements are as 
follows:2.4.1 Income taxesThe Group is operating in numerous countries and the income generated from these operations is subject to income taxes based on tax laws and 
interpretations of tax authorities in numerous jurisdictions. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018079If certain portion of the taxable income is not used for investments, increase in wages, and others in accordance with the Tax System for Promotion 
of Investment and Collaborative Cooperation (Recirculation of Corporate Income), the Group is liable to pay additional income tax calculated based 
on the tax laws.  The new tax system is effective for three years from 2018. Accordingly, the measurement of current and deferred income tax is 
affected by the tax effects from the new system. As the Group’s income tax is dependent on the investments, increase in wages, and others, there 
exists uncertainty with regard to measuring the final tax effects.2.4.2 Fair value of financial instruments
 
The fair value of financial instruments where no active market exists or where quoted prices are not otherwise available is determined by using 
valuation techniques. Financial instruments, which are not actively traded in the market and those with less transparent market prices, will have less 
objective fair values and require broad judgment on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty in market factors and assumptions in price determination 
and other risks.
 
As described in the significant accounting policies in Note 3.3, ‘Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments’, diverse valuation 
techniques are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, from generally accepted market valuation models to internally developed 
valuation models that incorporate various types of assumptions and variables.2.4.3 Provisions for credit losses (allowances for loan losses, provisions for acceptances and guarantees, and unused loan 
commitments)
 
The Group tests impairment and recognizes allowances for losses on financial assets classified at amortized cost, debt instruments measured at 
fair value through other comprehensive income and lease receivables through impairment testing and recognizes provisions for guarantees, and 
unused loan commitments. Accuracy of provisions for credit losses is dependent upon estimation of expected cash flows of the borrower for 
individually assessed allowances of loans, and upon assumptions and methodology used for collectively assessed allowances for groups of loans, 
guarantees and unused loan commitments.2.4.4 Net defined benefit liability
 
The present value of net defined benefit liability depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of 
assumptions (Note 24).2.4.5 Impairment of goodwill
 
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations to test whether goodwill has suffered 
any impairment (Note 15).3. Significant Accounting Policies
 
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. The items related to 
financial instruments on the consolidated financial statements were stated under Korean IFRS 1109 for the current year, and under Korean IFRS 
1039 for the year ended December 31, 2017. And The items related to Revenue from Contracts with Customers were stated under Korean IFRS 
1115 for the current year, and under Korean IFRS 1018 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The accounting policies on financial instruments 
were applied for current period, and comparatives are not restated retrospectively. Except for the changes related to financial instruments, these 
policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented.080 FINANCIAL SECTION3.1 Consolidation3.1.1 Subsidiaries
 
Subsidiaries are companies that are controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The existence and effects of potential 
voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are 
fully consolidated from the date when control is transferred to the Group and de-consolidated from the date when control is lost.
 
If a subsidiary uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in 
similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to make the subsidiary’s accounting policies conform to those of the Group when the 
subsidiary’s financial statements are used by the Group in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
 
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Parent Company and to the non-controlling 
interests, if any.  Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the Parent Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this 
results in the non-controlling interests having a negative balance. 
 
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions; that is, as transactions with 
the owners exercising their entitlement. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying 
value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
 
When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the 
change in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for 
the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income 
in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. Amounts previously recognized in 
other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
 
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred is measured at the fair values of the 
assets transferred, and identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially measured 
at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis 
in the event of liquidation, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognized amounts of acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
 
In a business combination achieved in stages, the Group shall remeasure its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date 
fair value and recognize the resulting gain or loss, if any, in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, as appropriate. In prior reporting periods, 
the Group may have recognized changes in the value of its equity interest in the acquiree in other comprehensive income. If so, the amount that 
was recognized in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified as profit or loss, or retained earnings, on the same basis as would be required if 
the Group had disposed directly of the previously held equity interest.
 
The Group applies the book amount method to account for business combinations of entities under a common control. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their book amounts on the consolidated financial statements of the 
Group. In addition, the difference between the sum of consolidated book amounts of the assets and liabilities transferred and accumulated other 
comprehensive income; and the consideration paid is recognized as capital surplus.3.1.2 Associates and joint ventures
 
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence in the financial and operating policy decisions. Generally, if the Group holds 20% to 
50% of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the Group has significant influence, it is presumed that the Group has significant influence.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018081Joint ventures are investments in which the Group jointly controls over economic activities pursuant to contractual arrangement. Decisions on 
financial and operating policies require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
 
Under the equity method, investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is increased or 
decreased to recognize the Group’s share of the profit or loss of the investee and changes in the investee’s equity after the date of acquisition.  The 
Group’s share of the profit or loss of the investee is recognized in the Group’s profit or loss. Distributions received from an investee reduce the 
carrying amount of the investment. Profit and loss resulting from ‘upstream’ and ‘downstream’ transactions between the Group and associates are 
eliminated to the extent at the Group’s interest in associates. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains except that they 
are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
 
If associates and joint ventures use accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and 
events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to make the associate’s accounting policies conform to those of the Group 
when the associate’s financial statements are used by the Group in applying equity method.
 
After the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognized, only to the extent 
that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.
 
The Group determines at each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the investments in the associates and joint ventures 
are impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the 
associates and its carrying value and recognizes the amount as ‘non-operating income(expense)’ in the statements of comprehensive income.
 
 
3.1.3 Structured entity
 
A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the 
entity. When the Group decides whether it has power to the structured entities in which the Group has interests, it considers factors such as the 
purpose, the form, the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of a structured entity, the nature of its relationship with a structured entity 
and the amount of exposure to variable returns.3.1.4 Trusts and funds
 
The Group provides management services for trust assets, collective investment and other funds. These trusts and funds are not consolidated in 
the Group’s consolidated financial statements, except for trusts and funds over which the Group has control.3.1.5 Intra-group transactions
 
All intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized gains arising on intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated 
financial statements. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that 
there is no evidence of impairment.3.2 Foreign Currency
 
3.2.1 Foreign currency transactions
 
A foreign currency transaction is recorded, on initial recognition in the functional currency, by applying the spot exchange rate between the 
functional currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction.  At the end of each reporting period, foreign currency monetary items 
are translated using the closing rate which is the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.  Non-monetary items that are measured082 FINANCIAL SECTIONat fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined and non-monetary 
items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction.  
 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they 
were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous consolidated financial statements are recognized in profit or loss in the period 
in which they arise, except for exchange differences arising on net investments in a foreign operation and financial liability designated as a hedge 
of the net investment. When gains or losses on a non-monetary item are recognized in other comprehensive income, any exchange component of 
those gains or losses are also recognized in other comprehensive income. Conversely, when gains or losses on a non-monetary item are recognized 
in profit or loss, any exchange component of those gains or losses are also recognized in profit or loss.3.2.2 Foreign operations
 
The financial performance and financial position of all foreign operations, whose functional currencies differ from the Group’s presentation 
currency, are translated into the Group’s presentation currency using the following procedures.
 
Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented (including comparatives) are translated at the closing rate at the end of the 
reporting period, unless the functional currency of the foreign operation is in hyper-inflationary economy. Income and expenses in the statement 
of comprehensive income presented are translated using the average exchange rates for the period. All resulting exchange differences are 
recognized in other comprehensive income.
 
Any goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
arising from the acquisition of that foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation. Thus, they are expressed in the 
functional currency of the foreign operation and are translated into the presentation currency at the closing rate.
 
On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation, recognized in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the separate component of equity, is reclassified from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification 
adjustment) when the gains or losses on disposal are recognized. On the partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the 
Group redistributes the proportionate share of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognized in other comprehensive income to 
the non-controlling interests in that foreign operation. In any other partial disposal of a foreign operation, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss 
only the proportionate share of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognized in other comprehensive income.3.2.3 Net investment in a foreign operation
 
If the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable 
future, then foreign currency difference arising on the item which in substance is considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign 
operation, are recognized in the other comprehensive income and shall be reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the investment.3.3 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments
 
3.3.1 Initial recognition
 
The Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets (a purchase or sale of a financial asset under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the financial instruments within the time frame established generally by market regulation or practice) is recognized 
and derecognized using trade date accounting.
 
The Group classifies financial assets as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income, or financial assets at amortized cost. The Group classifies financial liabilities as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, orKB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018083other financial liabilities. The classification depends on the nature and holding purpose of the financial instrument at initial recognition in the 
consolidated financial statements. At initial recognition, a financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of 
a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue 
of the financial asset or financial liability.
  
The fair value is defined as the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an 
arm’s length transaction. The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (that is, the fair value of the 
consideration given or received) in an arm’s length transaction.3.3.2 Subsequent measurement
 
After initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at amortized cost or fair value based on classification at initial recognition.  
 
Amortized cost
 
The amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial 
recognition:
 
- minus the principal repayments
-  plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount
- or any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance account) due to impairment or uncollectibility
 
Fair value
 
Fair values, which the Group primarily uses for the measurement of financial instruments, are the published price quotations based on market prices 
or dealer price quotations of financial instruments traded in an active market where available. These are the best evidence of fair value. A financial 
instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, an entity 
in the same industry, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an 
arm's length basis. 
 
If the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is determined either by using a valuation technique or independent third-party 
valuation service. Valuation techniques include using recent arm's length market transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, if available, 
referencing to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models. 
 
The Group uses valuation models that are commonly used by market participants and customized for the Group to determine fair values of 
common over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives such as options, interest rate swaps and currency swaps which are based on the inputs observable 
in markets. For more complex instruments, the Group uses internally developed models, which are usually based on valuation methods and 
techniques generally used within the industry, or a value measured by an independent external valuation institution as the fair values if all or some 
of the inputs to the valuation models are not market observable and therefore it is necessary to estimate fair value based on certain assumptions.
 
In addition, the fair value information recognized in the statements of financial position is classified into the following fair value hierarchy, reflecting 
the significance of the input variables used in the fair value measurement.
 
Level 1 : quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date
Level 2 : inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 
Level 3 : unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety shall be determined on the basis of the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against 
the fair value measurement in its entirety.084 FINANCIAL SECTIONIf a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 
measurement.  
 
If the valuation technique does not reflect all factors which market participants would consider in setting a price, the fair value is adjusted to reflect 
those factors.  Those factors include counterparty credit risk, bid-ask spread, liquidity risk and others.
 
The chosen valuation technique makes maximum use of market inputs and relies as little as possible on entity-specific inputs. It incorporates 
all factors that market participants would consider in setting a price and is consistent with economic methodologies applied for pricing financial 
instruments. Periodically, the Group calibrates the valuation technique and tests its validity using prices of observable current market transactions 
of the same instrument or based on other relevant observable market data.3.3.3 Derecognition
 
Derecognition is the removal of a previously recognized financial asset or financial liability from the statement of financial position. The Group 
derecognizes a financial asset or a financial liability when, and only when:
 
Derecognition of financial assets
 
Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or the financial assets have been 
transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are also transferred, or all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial assets are neither substantially transferred nor retained and the Group has not retained control. If the Group neither 
transfers nor disposes of substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets, the Group continues to recognize the financial 
asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the financial asset.
 
If the Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset in its entirety and recognize a financial liability for the 
consideration received.
 
The Group writes off financial assets in its entirety or to a portion thereof when the principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are 
determined to be no longer recoverable. In general, the Group considers write-off if significant financial difficulties of the debtor, or delinquency 
in interest or principal payments is indicated. The write-off decision is made in accordance with internal regulations and may require approval 
from external institution, if necessary. After the write-off, the Group can collect the written-off loans continuously according to the internal 
policy.  Recovered amounts of financial assets previously written-off are recognized at profit or loss.
 
Derecognition of financial liabilities
 
Financial liabilities are derecognized from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled 
or expires.3.3.4 Offsetting
 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated statements of financial position where there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the assets and settle the liability 
simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business 
and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparty.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 20180853.4 Cash and Due from Financial Institutions
 
Cash and due from financial institutions include cash on hand, foreign currency, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and due from financial institutions.  Cash 
and due from financial institutions are measured at amortized cost.3.5 Non-derivative Financial Assets
 
3.5.1 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
 
Financial assets classified as held for trading, financial assets designated by the Group as at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition, 
and financial assets that are required to be mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss are classified as financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss
 
The Group may designate certain financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss when the designation eliminates or 
significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as 'an accounting mismatch') that would otherwise arise 
from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on different bases.
 
After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is measured at fair value and gains or losses arising from a change in 
the fair value are recognized in profit or loss. Interest income and dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are also 
recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.3.5.2 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
 
The Group classifies below financial assets as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income;
-  debt instruments that are a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, andconsistent with representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding or;-  equity instruments, not held for trading with the objective of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealer’smargin, designated as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive incomeAfter initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income is measured at fair value. Gain and loss from changes in 
fair value, other than dividend income and interest income amortized using effective interest method and exchange differences arising on monetary 
items which are recognized directly in income as interest income or expense, are recognized as other comprehensive income in equity.
 
At disposal of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, cumulative gain or loss is recognized as profit or loss for the 
reporting period. However, cumulative gain or loss of equity instrument designated as fair value through other comprehensive income are not 
recycled to profit or loss at disposal. 
 
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate. Exchange 
differences resulting from changes in amortized cost are recognized in profit or loss, and other changes are recognized as equity.3.5.3 Financial assets measured at amortized cost
 
A financial asset, which are held within the business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and 
consistent with representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are classified as a financial asset at 
amortized cost.086 FINANCIAL SECTIONFinancial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method after initial recognition and 
interest income is recognized using the effective interest method.
 
 
3.6 Expected Credit Loss of Financial Assets (Debt Instruments)
 
The Group measures expected credit loss and recognizes loss allowance at the end of the reporting period for financial assets measured at amortized 
cost and fair value through other comprehensive income with the exception of financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss.
 
Expected credit losses are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses (i.e. the present value of all cash shortfalls) over the expected life of the 
financial instrument. The Group measures expected credit losses by reflecting reasonable and supportable information that is reasonably available 
at the reporting date without undue cost or effort, including information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic 
conditions.
 
The Group uses the following three measurement techniques in accordance with Korean IFRS: 
- General approach: for financial assets and off-balance-sheet unused credit line that are not applied below two approaches
- Simplified approach: for receivables, contract assets and lease receivables 
- Credit-impaired approach: for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets
 
Different measurement approaches are applied depending on significant increase in credit risk. 12 month expected credit losses is recognized 
when credit risk has not significantly increased since initial recognition. A loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses is 
recognized when credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition. Lifetime is presumed to be a period to the contractual maturity date 
of a financial asset (the expected life of the financial asset).
 
One or more of the following items is deemed significant increase in credit risk. 30 days past due presumption is applicable for all consolidated 
subsidiaries, and other standards are selectively applied considering applicability of each subsidiary with its specific indicators. When the contractual 
cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified, the Group determines whether the credit risk has increased significantly 
since initial recognition using the following information.
 
- more than 30 days past due;
- decline in credit rating at period end by more than certain notches as compared to that at initial recognition;
- decline in ratings below certain level in the early warning system;
- debt restructuring (except for impaired financial assets); and
- credit delinquency information on Korea Federation of Banks, and etc. 
 
Under simplified approach, the Group shall always measure the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Under credit-
impaired approach, the Group shall only recognize the cumulative changes in lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition as a loss 
allowance for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets. In assessing credit impairment, the Group uses definition of default as in the 
new Basel Accord which rules calculation of Capital Adequacy Ratio.
 
The Group generally deems one or more of the following items credit-impaired:- no less than 90 days past due;
- legal proceedings related to collection;
- a borrower that has received a warning from the Korea Federation of Banks;
- corporate borrowers that are rated C or D;
- refinancing; and
- debt restructuring.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 20180873.6.1 Forward-looking information 
 
The Group uses forward-looking information, when it determines whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition and 
measures expected credit losses.
 
The Group assumes the risk component has a certain correlation with the business cycle, and calculates the expected credit loss by reflecting the 
forward-looking information with macroeconomic variables on the measurement inputs.
 
The correlation between the major macroeconomic variables and the credit risk is as follows;Key macroeconomic variablesDomestic GDP growth rate
Composite stock index
Construction investment change rate
Housing transaction price index
Consumer price index
Overnight call rate changes compare to previous year(%P)

consideration of a variety of factors including scenario in management planning, third party forecast, and others.3.6.2 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at amortized cost 
 
The amount of the loss on financial assets at amortized cost is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present 
value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.
 
The Group estimates expected future cash flows for financial assets that are individually significant (individual assessment of impairment).
 
For financial assets that are not individually significant, the Group collectively estimates expected credit loss by grouping loans with homogeneous 
credit risk profile (collective assessment of impairment).
 
Individual assessment of impairment
 
Individual assessment of impairment losses are calculated using management's best estimate on present value of expected future cash flows. The 
Group uses all the available information including operating cash flow of the borrower and net realizable value of any collateral held.  
 
Collective assessment of impairment
 
Collective assessment of loss allowance involves historical loss experience along with incorporation of forward-looking information. Such process 
incorporates factors such as type of collateral, product and borrowers, credit rating, size of portfolio and recovery period and applies ‘probability of 
default’(PD) on a group of assets and ‘loss given default’(LGD) by type of recovery method. Also, the expected credit loss model involves certain 
assumption to determine input based on loss experience and forward-looking information. These models and assumptions are periodically reviewed 
to reduce gap between loss estimate and actual loss experience.088 FINANCIAL SECTIONLifetime expected credit loss as at the end of the reporting period is calculated by product of carrying amount net of expected repayment, PD for 
each period and LGD adjusted by change in carrying amount.3.6.3 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
 
Measuring method of expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is equal to the method of 
financial assets at amortized cost, except for loss allowances that are recognized as other comprehensive income. Amounts recognized in other 
comprehensive income for sale or repayment of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.3.7 Derivative Financial Instruments
 
The Group enters into numerous derivative financial instrument contracts such as currency forwards, interest rate swaps, currency swaps and others 
for trading purposes or to manage its exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange, amongst others. These derivative financial 
instruments are presented as derivative financial instruments within the consolidated financial statements irrespective of transaction purpose and 
subsequent measurement requirement.
 
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an 
unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge) and the risk of changes in cash flow (cash flow hedge). The Group designates non-derivatives as 
hedging instruments to hedge the risk of foreign exchange of a net investment in a foreign operation (hedge of net investment).
 
At the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the Group's risk management 
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. This documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or 
transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Group will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to 
changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
 
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are 
accounted for as described below.3.7.1 Derivative financial instruments held for trading
 
All derivative financial instruments, except for derivatives that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, are measured at fair value. Gains or 
losses arising from a change in fair value are recognized in profit or loss as part of net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit 
or loss.3.7.2 Fair value hedges
 
If derivatives qualify for a fair value hedge, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of the hedged item 
attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in profit or loss as part of other operating income and expenses. If hedged items are equity 
instruments and designated to present the change in fair value of the hedging instrument in other comprehensive income, recognized hedge 
ineffectiveness are presented in other comprehensive income. Fair value hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the 
designation. Once fair value hedge accounting is discontinued, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item is fully amortized to profit 
or loss by the maturity of the financial instrument using the effective interest method.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 20180893.7.3 Cash flow hedges
 
The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in other 
comprehensive income, limited to the cumulative change in fair value (present value) of the hedged item (the present value of the cumulative 
change in the future expected cash flows of the hedged item) from the inception of the hedge. The ineffective portion is recognized in gain or 
loss (other operating income or expense). The associated gains or losses that were previously recognized in other comprehensive income are 
reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast cash 
flows affects profit or loss. The associated gains or losses that were previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified from 
equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast cash flows affects profit or 
loss. Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the hedge 
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation. When the cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, the 
cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument that have been recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss 
over the year in which the forecast transaction occurs. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses 
that had been recognized in other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.3.7.4 Hedge of net investment 
 
If derivatives and non-derivatives qualify for a net investment hedge, the effective portion of changes in fair value of hedging instrument is 
recognized in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognized in profit. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating 
to the effective portion of the hedge that has been recognized in other comprehensive income will be reclassified from other comprehensive 
income to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation in accordance with Korean IFRS 
1109 Financial Instruments.3.7.5 Embedded derivatives
 
If a hybrid contract contains a host that is not an asset, an embedded derivative is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a 
derivative if, and only if the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract 
and a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative and the hybrid (combined) 
instrument is not measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.  Gains or losses arising from a change in the fair value 
of an embedded derivative separated from the host contract are recognized in profit or loss as part of net gains or losses on financial instruments 
at fair value through profit or loss.3.7.6 Day one gain and loss
 
If the Group uses a valuation technique that incorporates data not obtained from observable markets for the fair value at initial recognition of the 
financial instrument, there may be a difference between the transaction price and the amount determined using that valuation technique.  In these 
circumstances, the difference is deferred and not recognized in profit or loss, and is amortized by using the straight-line method over the life of the 
financial instrument.  If the fair value of the financial instrument is subsequently determined using observable market inputs, the remaining deferred 
amount is recognized in profit or loss as part of net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss or other operating 
income and expenses.090 FINANCIAL SECTION3.8 Property and Equipment
 
3.8.1 Recognition and measurement
 
All property and equipment that qualify for recognition as an asset are measured at cost and subsequently carried at cost less any accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.  
 
The cost of property and equipment includes any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to 
be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and 
restoring the site on which it is located.
 
Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when they prolong the useful life or enhance values of the assets but the costs of the day-to-day 
servicing of the assets such as repair and maintenance costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.  When part of an item of an asset has a 
useful life different from that of the entire asset, it is recognized as a separate asset.3.8.2 Depreciation 
 
Land is not depreciated, whereas other property and equipment are depreciated using the method that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s 
future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group. The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its 
residual value. As for leased assets, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset 
is fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life.
 
Each part of an item of property and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.
 
The depreciation method and estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:Property and equipment
Buildings and structures
Leasehold improvements

from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.9 Investment Properties
 
3.9.1 Recognition and measurement
 
Properties held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both are classified as investment properties. Investment properties are measured 
initially at their cost and subsequently the cost model is used.3.9.2 Depreciation
 
Land is not depreciated, whereas other investment properties are depreciated using the method that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s future 
economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group. The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018091The depreciation method and estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:Investment propertyBuildingsDepreciation methodStraight-lineEstimated useful life20~40 yearsThe residual value, the useful life and the depreciation method applied to an asset are reviewed at each financial year end.

3.10 Intangible Assets
 
Intangible assets are measured initially at cost and subsequently carried at their cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated 
impairment losses.
 
Intangible assets, except for goodwill and membership rights, are amortized using the straight-line method or double declining balance method 
with no residual value over their estimated useful economic life since the asset is available for use.Intangible assetsIndustrial property rightsSoftwareFinance leased assetsVOBA

1~10 yearsThe amortization period and the amortization method for intangible assets with a definite useful life are reviewed at each financial year end. Where 
an intangible asset is not being amortized because its useful life is considered to be indefinite, the Group carries out a review in each accounting 
period to confirm whether or not events and circumstances still support the assumption of an indefinite useful life. If they do not, the change from 
the indefinite to definite useful life is accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.10.1 Value of business acquired (VOBA)
 
The Group recorded value of business acquired (VOBA) as intangible assets, which are the differences between the fair value of insurance liabilities 
and book value calculated based on the accounting policy of the acquired company. VOBA is an estimated present value of future cash flow of 
long-term insurance contracts at the acquisition date. VOBA is amortized over the above estimated useful life using declining balance method, and 
the depreciation is recognized as insurance expense.3.10.2 Goodwill
 
Recognition and measurement
 
Goodwill arisen from business combinations before January 1, 2010, is stated at its carrying amount which was recognized under the Group’s 
previous accounting policy, prior to the transition to Korean IFRS.
 
Goodwill acquired from business combinations after January 1, 2010, is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred, fair value of non-controlling interest and the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree 
over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the business 
acquired, the difference is recognized in profit or loss.092 FINANCIAL SECTIONFor each business combination, the Group decides whether the non-controlling interest in the acquiree is initially measured at fair value or at the 
non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets at the acquisition date.
 
Acquisition-related costs incurred to effect a business combination are charged to expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the 
services are received, except for the costs to issue debt or equity securities.
 
Additional acquisitions of non-controlling interest
 
Additional acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as equity transactions. Therefore, no additional goodwill is recognized.
 
Subsequent measurement
 
Goodwill is not amortized and is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. However, goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of 
an investment in associates is not separately recognized and an impairment loss recognized is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, which 
forms part of the carrying amount of the investment in the associates.3.10.3 Subsequent expenditure
 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it enhances values of the assets. Internally generated intangible assets, such as goodwill and trade 
name, are not recognized as assets but expensed as incurred.3.11 Leases
 
3.11.1 Finance lease
 
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. At the commencement of the 
lease term, the Group recognizes finance leases as assets and liabilities in its statements of financial position at amounts equal to the fair value of 
the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. Any initial direct 
costs of the lessee are added to the amount recognized as an asset.
 
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge 
is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability.  Contingent rents are charged as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.
 
The depreciable amount of a leased asset is allocated to each accounting period during the period of expected use on a systematic basis 
consistent with the depreciation policy the Group adopts for depreciable assets that are owned. If there is reasonable certainty that the lessee will 
obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the period of expected use is the useful life of the asset; otherwise, the asset is fully depreciated 
over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life.3.11.2 Operating lease
 
A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership.
 
Leases in the financial statements of lessors
 
Lease income from operating leases are recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is 
more representative of the time pattern in which use benefit derived from the leased asset is diminished. Initial direct costs incurred by lessors inKB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018093negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized as an expense over the lease 
term on the same basis as the lease income.
 
Leases in the financial statements of lessees
 
Lease payments are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of 
the time pattern of the asset's benefit, and the incentives from operating lease are recognized as a reduction of lease payments over the lease term.3.12 Greenhouse Gas Emission Rights and Liabilities 
 
The Group measured at zero the emission rights received free of charge from the government following the Enforcement of Allocation and Trading 
of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Allowances.. Emission rights purchased are measured initially at cost and subsequently carried at their costs less any 
accumulated impairment losses. Emission liabilities are measured as the sum of the carrying amount of emission allowances held by the Group and 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation for any excess emissions at the end of reporting period. The emission rights and 
liabilities are classified as ‘intangible assets’ and ‘provisions’, respectively, in the consolidated statement of financial position.
 
The emission rights held for trading are measured at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. The changes in fair 
value and gain or loss on disposal are classified as non-operating income and expenses.3.13 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
 
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset, except for (i) deferred income 
tax assets, (ii) assets arising from employee benefits and (iii) non-current assets (or group of assets to be sold) classified as held for sale, may be 
impaired. If any such indication exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. However, irrespective of whether there is any 
indication of impairment, the Group tests (i) goodwill acquired in a business combination, (ii) intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and (iii) 
intangible assets not yet available for use for impairment annually by comparing their carrying amount with their recoverable amount. 
 
The recoverable amount is estimated for the individual asset. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, the 
Group determines the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs (the asset's cash-generating unit). A cash-
generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other 
assets or groups of assets. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is 
the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit that are discounted by a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have 
not been adjusted.
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. That 
reduction is an impairment loss and recognized immediately in profit or loss. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill arising from in a 
business combination is allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit and then to the other assets 
of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
 
An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period 
whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset, other than goodwill, may no longer exist or may 
have decreased, and an impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill shall be reversed if, and only if, there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The increased carrying 
amount of an asset other than goodwill attributable to a reversal of an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.094 FINANCIAL SECTION3.14 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale
 
A non-current asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present 
condition and its sale must be highly probable. A non-current asset (or disposal group) classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell which is measured in accordance with the applicable Korean IFRS, immediately before the initial 
classification of the asset (or disposal group) as held for sale.
   
A non-current asset while it is classified as held for sale or while it is part of a disposal group classified as held for sale is not depreciated (or 
amortized). 
 
Impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. Gains are 
recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of the cumulative impairment loss that has been 
recognized.3.15 Financial Liabilities
 
The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities in 
accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of financial liabilities.  
 
The Group recognizes financial liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the financial liability.3.15.1 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading or designated as such upon initial recognition. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are 
recognized in profit or loss. Upon initial recognition, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are recognized in profit or loss 
as incurred.
 
In relation to securities lending or borrowing transactions, the Group records transaction using memo value when it borrows securities from Korea 
Securities Depository etc. The borrowed securities are treated as financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss when the Group sells 
them. Changes in fair value at the end of the reporting period and difference between carrying amount at redemption and purchased amount are 
recognized as profit and loss.
 
In addition, for the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability, the 
Group presents this change in other comprehensive income, and does not recycle this to profit or loss, subsequently. When this treatment creates 
or enlarges an accounting mismatch, the Group recognizes this change as profit or loss for the current period.3.15.2 Other financial liabilities
 
Non-derivative financial liabilities other than financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are classified as other financial liabilities. Other 
financial liabilities include Deposits, Debts, Debentures and others. At the date of initial recognition, other financial liabilities are measured at 
fair value minus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, other financial liabilities are 
measured at amortized cost, and its interest expense is recognized, using the effective interest method.
 
In case an asset is sold under repurchase agreement, the Group continues to recognize the asset with the amount sold being accounted for as borrowing.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018095The Group derecognizes a financial liability from the consolidated statement of financial position only when it is extinguished (i.e. when the 
obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires).3.16 Insurance Contracts
 
KB Life Insurance Co., Ltd., and KB Insurance Co., Ltd., the subsidiaries of the Group, issue insurance contracts.
 
Insurance contracts are defined as “a contract under which one party (the insurer) accepts significant insurance risk from another party by agreeing 
to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder”. A contract that qualifies as an insurance 
contract remains an insurance contract until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire. Such a contract that does not contain significant 
insurance risk is classified as an investment contract and is within the scope of Korean IFRS 1109, Financial Instruments to the extent that it gives 
rise to a financial asset or financial liability, except if the investment contract contains a Discretionary Participation Features (DPF). If the contract 
has a DPF, the contract is subject to Korean IFRS 1104, Insurance Contracts. The Group recognizes assets (liabilities) and gains (losses) relating to 
insurance contracts as other assets (liabilities) in the statements of financial position, and as other operating income (expenses) in the statements 
of comprehensive income, respectively.3.16.1 Insurance premiums
 
The Group recognizes collected premiums as revenue on the due date of collection of premiums from insurance contracts and the collected 
premium which is not earned at the end of the reporting period is recognized as unearned premium.3.16.2 Insurance liabilities
 
The Group recognizes a liability for future claims, refunds, policyholders’ dividends and related expenses as follows:
 
Premium reserve
 
Premium reserve refers to an amount based on the net premium method for payment of future claims with respect to events covered by insurance 
policies which have not yet occurred as of the reporting period. It is calculated as the greater of the amount using standard interest rate and 
standard loss ratio defined by Financial Supervisory Services and the amount using the actual underlying data that have been used in premium 
calculation.
 
Reserve for outstanding claims
 
Reserve for outstanding claims refers to the amount not yet paid, out of an amount to be paid or expected to be paid with respect to the insured 
events which have arisen as of the end of each fiscal year.
       
Unearned premium reserve
 
The premiums that are due before the end of the reporting period but applicable to the next period are included.
 
Policyholders' dividends reserve
 
Policyholders' dividends reserve including an interest rate guarantee reserve, a mortality dividend reserve and an interest rate difference dividend 
reserve is recognized for the purpose of provisioning for policyholders' dividends in the future in accordance with statutes or insurance terms and 
conditions.096 FINANCIAL SECTION3.16.3 Liability adequacy test
 
The Group assesses at each reporting period whether its insurance liabilities are adequate, using current estimates of all future contractual cash 
flows and related cash flow such as claims handling cost, as well as cash flows resulting from embedded options and guarantees under its insurance 
contracts in accordance with Korean IFRS 1104. If the assessment shows that the carrying amount of its insurance liabilities is insufficient in light 
of the estimated future cash flows, additional reserve is recognized for the deficient amount. Future cash flows from long-term insurance are 
discounted at a future rate of return on operating assets, whereas future cash flows from general insurance are not discounted to present value. For 
liability adequacy tests of premium and unearned premium reserves, the Group considers all cash flow factors such as future insurance premium, 
deferred acquisition costs, operating expenses and operating premiums. In relation to the reserve for outstanding claims, the Group elects to use a 
model that best reflects the trend of paid claims among several statistical methods to perform the adequacy test.3.16.4 Deferred acquisition costs
 
Acquisition cost is deferred in an amount actually spent for an insurance contract and equally amortized over the premium payment period or the 
period in which acquisition costs are charged for the relevant insurance contract. Acquisition costs are amortized over the shorter of seven years 
or premium payment period; if there is any unamortized acquisition costs remaining as of the date of surrender or lapse, such remainder shall be 
amortized in the period in which the contract is surrendered or lapsed.3.17 Provisions
 
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching the 
best estimate of provisions, and where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of provisions are the present value of the 
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. 
 
Provisions on confirmed and unconfirmed acceptances and guarantees, unfunded commitments of credit cards and unused credit lines of consumer 
and corporate loans are recognized using a valuation model that applies the credit conversion factor, probability of default, and loss given default. 
 
Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provisions are reversed.
 
If the Group has an onerous contract, the present obligation under the contract is recognized and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is 
a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received 
under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the minimum net cost to exit from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it 
and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfill it.3.18 Financial Guarantee Contracts
 
A financial guarantee contract requires the issuer (the Group) to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a 
specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. 
 
Financial guarantee contracts are initially recognized at fair value as other liabilities, and are amortized over the contractual term. After initial 
recognition, financial guarantee contracts are measured at the higher of:
 
- The amount determined in accordance with Korean IFRS 1109, Financial Instruments orKB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018097-  The initial amount recognized, less, when appropriate, cumulative amortization recognized in accordance with Korean IFRS 1115, Revenue fromContracts with Customers.3.19 Equity Instruments Issued by the Group
 
An equity instrument is any contract or agreement that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.3.19.1 Ordinary shares
 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or the exercise of stock option are 
deducted from the equity, net of any tax effects.3.19.2 Hybrid capital instruments
 
The Group classifies issued financial instruments, or their component parts, as a financial liability or an equity instrument depending on the 
substance of the contractual arrangement of such financial instruments. Hybrid bonds are classified as equity instruments and presented in equity, 
if the Group has an unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset to settle a contractual obligation.3.19.3 Treasury shares
 
If the Group acquires its own equity instruments, these are accounted for as treasury shares and are deducted directly from equity. No gains or 
losses are recognized in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own equity instruments. If an entity within the Group acquires 
and retains treasury shares, the consideration paid or received is directly recognized in equity.3.19.4 Hybrid financial instruments
 
A hybrid financial instrument is classified as a financial liability or an equity instrument depending on the substance of the contractual arrangement 
of such financial instrument. The liability component of the hybrid financial instrument is measured at fair value of the similar liability without 
conversion option at initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortized cost using effective interest rate method until it is extinguished 
by conversion or matured. Equity component is initially measured at fair value of hybrid financial instrument in entirety less fair value of liability 
component net of tax effect and it is not remeasured subsequently.3.20 Revenue Recognition
 
The Group recognizes revenues in accordance with the following revenue recognition standard:
 
- Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer.
- Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
- Step 3: Determine the transaction price.
- Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
- Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.098 FINANCIAL SECTION3.20.1 Interest income and expense
 
Interest income of financial assets at amortized cost and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and expense are 
recognized in statements of comprehensive income using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating 
the amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability (or groups of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income 
or interest expense over the relevant period. 
 
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial 
instrument or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. When calculating the 
effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider future 
credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid (main components of effective interest rates only) or received between parties to the 
contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts. In those rare cases when it is 
not possible to estimate reliably the cash flows or the expected life of a financial instrument (or group of financial instruments), the Group uses the 
contractual cash flows over the full contractual term of the financial instrument (or group of financial instruments).
 
Interest on impaired financial assets is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the 
impairment loss.
 
Interest earned arising from debt investments at fair value through profit or loss is also classified as interest income in statements of comprehensive 
income.3.20.2 Fee and commission income
 
The Group recognizes financial service fees in accordance with the accounting standard of the financial instrument related to the fees earned. 
 
Fees that are an integral part of the effective interest of a financial instrument
 
Such fees are generally treated as adjustments of effective interest. Such fees may include compensation for activities such as evaluating the 
borrower's financial condition, evaluating and recording guarantees, collateral and other security arrangements, negotiating the terms of the 
instrument, preparing and processing documents and closing the transaction and origination fees received on issuing financial liabilities measured 
at amortized cost. However, fees relating to the creation or acquisition of a financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss are recognized 
as revenue immediately.
 
Fees earned as services are provided
 
Such fees are recognized as revenue as the services are provided. Fees which can be earned through the certain periods, including account 
servicing fees, investment management fees, and etc. are recognized when the related services are provided.
 
Fees that are earned on the execution of a significant act
 
Such fees are recognized as revenue when the significant act has been completed.
 
Commission on the allotment of shares to a client is recognized as revenue when the shares have been allotted and placement fees for arranging a 
loan between a borrower and an investor is recognized as revenue when the loan has been arranged.
 
A syndication fee received by the Group that arranges a loan and retains no part of the loan package for itself (or retains a part at the same 
effective interest rate for comparable risk as other participants) is compensation for the service of syndication. Such a fee is recognized as revenue 
when the syndication has been completed.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 20180993.20.3 Net gains/losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss
 
Net gains/losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss include profit or loss (changes in fair value, dividends, and gain/loss 
from foreign currency translation) from following financial instruments:
 
- Gain or loss from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss 
- Gain or loss from derivatives for trading, including derivatives for hedging that does not meet the condition of hedge accounting3.20.4 Dividend income
 
Dividend income is recognized in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established. Dividend income is recognized as relevant items on 
statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in accordance with the classification of equity instruments.3.21 Employee Compensation and Benefits
 
3.21.1 Post-employment benefits: defined contribution plans
 
The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due.3.21.2 Post-employment benefits: defined benefit plans
 
All post-employment benefits, other than defined contribution plans, are classified as defined benefit plans. The amount recognized as a defined 
benefit liability is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the end of the reporting period.
 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit method. The 
rate used to discount post-employment benefit obligations is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on 
high quality corporate bonds. The currency and term of the corporate bonds are consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-
employment benefit obligations. Actuarial gains and losses including experience adjustments and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions 
are recognized in other comprehensive income.
 
When the total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation minus the fair value of plan assets results in an asset, it is recognized to the 
extent of the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. 
 
Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation, which arises when the Group introduces a defined benefit plan or 
changes the benefits of an existing defined benefit plan.  Such past service cost is immediately recognized as an expense for the reporting period.3.21.3 Short-term employee benefits
 
Short-term employee benefits are employee benefits (other than termination benefits) that are due to be settled within 12 months after the end 
of the period in which the employees render the related service. The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid 
in exchange for that service is recognized as a liability (accrued expense), after deducting any amount already paid.
 
The expected cost of profit-sharing and bonus payments are recognized as liabilities when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
to make such payments as a result of past events rendered by employees and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.100 FINANCIAL SECTION3.21.4 Share-based payment
 
The Group has provided its directors and employees with stock grant, and mileage stock programs. When stock grant options are exercised, 
the Group can either select to issue new shares or distribute treasury shares, or compensate the difference in fair value of shares and exercise 
price.  When mileage stock options are exercised, the Group pays the amount equivalent to KB Financial Group's share price in cash.
 
For a share-based payment transaction in which the terms of the arrangement provide the Group with the choice of whether to settle in cash or 
by issuing equity instruments, the Group determines that it has a present obligation to settle in cash because the Group has a past practice and 
a stated policy of settling in cash. Therefore, the Group accounts for the transaction in accordance with the requirements of cash-settled share-
based payment transactions. For mileage stock option, the Group accounts for the transaction in accordance with cash-settled share-based 
payment transactions, which are recognized as accrued expenses at the time of vesting.
 
The Group measures the services acquired and the liability incurred at fair value, and the fair value is recognized as expense and accrued expenses 
over the vesting period. Until the liability is settled, the Group remeasures the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting period and at 
the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the reporting period.3.21.5 Termination benefits
 
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee 
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group shall recognize a liability and expense for termination benefits at the 
earlier of the following dates: when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group recognizes costs for a 
restructuring that is within the scope of Korean IFRS 1037 and involves the payment of termination benefits. Termination benefits are measured 
by considering the number of employees expected to accept the offer in the case of a voluntary early retirement. Termination benefits over 12 
months after the reporting period are discounted to present value.3.22 Income Tax Expenses
 
Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and deferred income tax expense. Current and deferred income tax are recognized as income 
or expense for the period, except to the extent that the tax arises from (a) a transaction or an event which is recognized, in the same or a different 
period outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and (b) a business combination.3.22.1 Current income tax
 
Current income tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit (loss) for a period. A difference between the taxable profit 
and accounting profit may arise when income or expense is included in accounting profit in one period, but is included in taxable profit in a different 
period. Differences may also arise if there is revenue that is exempt from taxation, or expense that is not deductible in determining taxable profit 
(loss). Current income tax liabilities (assets) for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be paid to (recovered from) 
the taxation authorities, using the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
 
The Group offsets current income tax assets and current income tax liabilities if, and only if, the Group (a) has a legally enforceable right to offset 
the recognized amounts and (b) intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.3.22.2 Deferred income tax
 
Deferred income tax is recognized, using the asset-liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax based amount of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amount in the financial statements.  Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differencesKB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018101and deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized.  However, deferred income tax liabilities are not recognized if they 
arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
 
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except for deferred 
income tax liabilities for which the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
 
The carrying amount of a deferred income tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The Group reduces the carrying amount of a 
deferred income tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all 
of that deferred income tax asset to be utilized.
 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.  The 
measurement of deferred income tax liabilities and deferred income tax assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in 
which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
 
The Group offsets deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current 
income tax assets against current income tax liabilities; and the deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities relate to income 
taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity; or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current 
income tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which 
significant amounts of deferred income tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.3.22.3 Uncertain tax positions
 
Uncertain tax positions arise from tax treatments applied by the Group which may be challenged by the tax authorities due to the complexity of 
the transaction or different interpretation of the tax laws, a claim for rectification brought by the Group, or an appeal for a refund claimed from 
the tax authorities related to additional assessments. The Group recognizes its uncertain tax positions in the consolidated financial statements 
based on the guidance in Korean IFRS 1012. The income tax asset is recognized if a tax refund is probable for taxes paid and levied by the tax 
authority.  However, interest and penalties related to income tax are recognized in accordance with Korean IFRS 1037.3.23 Earnings per Share
 
The Group calculates basic earnings per share amounts and diluted earnings per share amounts for profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity 
holders of the Parent Company and presents them in the statement of comprehensive income.  Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing 
profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during 
the period.  For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the Group adjusts profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of 
the Parent Company and the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares including 
convertible bonds and share options.3.24 Operating Segments
 
Operating segments are components of the Group where separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the chief 
operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
 
Segment information includes items which are directly attributable and reasonably allocated to the segment.102 FINANCIAL SECTION3.25 Overlay Approach
 
The Group applies the overlay approach in accordance with Korean IFRS 1104, and financial asset is eligible for designation for the overlay 
approach if, and only if, the following criteria are met:
-  It is measured at fair value through profit or loss applying Korean IFRS 1109 but would not have been measured at fair value through profit or lossin its entirety applying Korean IFRS 1039.- It is not held in respect of an activity that is unconnected with contracts within the scope of Korean IFRS 1104.
 
The Group reclassifies between profit or loss and other comprehensive income, and the amount reclassified is equal to the difference between:  
- The amount reported in profit or loss for the designated financial assets applying Korean IFRS 1109.
- The amount that would have been reported in profit or loss for the designated financial assets if the insurer had applied Korean IFRS 1039.
 
The Group is permitted to apply this approach either at initial recognition or it may subsequently designate financial assets that newly meet 
criterion of not being held in respect of activity unconnected with insurance contract, they having previously not met that criterion.
 
The Group continues to apply the overlay approach to a designated financial asset until that financial asset is derecognized. However, the Group 
de-designates a financial asset when the financial asset no longer meets the criterion. In this case, the Group reclassifies from accumulated other 
comprehensive income to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment any balance relating to that financial asset.
 
At the beginning of any annual period, the Group may stop applying the overlay approach to all designated financial assets, and shall not subsequently 
apply the overlay approach, if it stops using this approach because it is no longer an insurer.4. Financial Risk Management
 
4.1 Summary
 
4.1.1 Overview of financial risk management policy 
 
The financial risks that the Group is exposed to are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and others.
 
The Group’s risk management system focuses on increasing transparency, developing the risk management environment, preventing transmission 
of risk to other related subsidiaries, and the preemptive response to risk due to rapid changes in the financial environment to support the Group’s 
long-term strategy and business decisions efficiently. Credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk have been recognized as the Group’s 
key risks. These risks are measured and managed in Economic Capital or VaR (Value at Risk) using a statistical method.4.1.2 Risk management organization
 
Risk Management Committee
 
The Risk Management Committee establishes risk management strategies in accordance with the directives of the Board of Directors and 
determines the Group’s target risk appetite. The Committee approves significant risk matters and reviews the level of risks that the Group is 
exposed to and the appropriateness of the Group’s risk management operations as an ultimate decision-making authority.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018103Risk Management Council
 
The Risk Management Council is a consultative group which reviews and makes decisions on matters delegated by the Risk Management 
Committee, and discusses the detailed issues relating to the Group’s risk management.
 
Risk Management Division
 
The Risk Management Division is responsible for monitoring and managing the Group’s economic capital limit and managing detailed policies, 
procedures and working processes relating to the Group’s risk management.4.2 Credit Risk
 
4.2.1 Overview of credit risk
 
Credit risk is the risk of possible losses in an asset portfolio in the event of a counterparty’s default, breach of contract and deterioration in the 
credit quality of the counterparty.  For risk management reporting purposes, the individual borrower’s default risk, country risk, specific risks and 
other credit risk exposure components are considered as a whole. 
 
The Group uses definition of default as defined and applied in the calculation of Capital Adequacy Ratio (Basel III) in accordance with the new Basel 
Accord.4.2.2 Credit risk management
 
The Group measures expected losses and economic capital on assets that are subject to credit risk management whether on- or off-balance 
sheet items and uses expected losses and economic capital as a management indicator.  The Group manages credit risk by allocating credit risk 
economic capital limits.
 
In addition, the Group controls the credit concentration risk exposure by applying and managing total exposure limits to prevent an excessive risk 
concentration to each industry and borrower.
 
The Group has organized a credit risk management team that focuses on credit risk management in accordance with the Group’s credit risk 
management policy.  Especially, the loan analysis department of Kookmin Bank, one of the subsidiaries, is responsible for loan policy, loan limit, 
loan review, credit management, restructuring and subsequent event management, independently of operating department.  On the other hand, 
risk management group of Kookmin Bank is responsible for planning risk management policy, applying limits of credit lines, measuring the credit 
risk economic capital, adjusting credit limits, reviewing credit and verifying credit evaluation models.4.2.3 Maximum exposure to credit risk

The Group maintains an allowance for loan losses associated with credit risk on loans to manage its credit risk.
 
The Group assesses expected credit loss on financial asset at amortized cost and financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive 
income other than financial asset at fair value through profit or loss and recognizes loss allowance. Expected credit losses are a probability-
weighted estimate of possible credit losses within certain range by reflecting reasonable and supportable information that is reasonably available 
at the reporting date without undue cost or effort, including information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic 
conditions. The Group assesses the expected credit losses for loans categorized in financial assets at amortized cost, and presents it with the name 
of account ‘allowance for loan losses’ netting from the related carrying amounts.  For the expected credit losses for loans categorized in financial 
assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, the Group presents it in other comprehensive income.Loans as of December 31, 2018, are classified as follows:The financial

4.3 Liquidity Risk 
 
4.3.1 Overview of liquidity risk 
 
Liquidity risk is a risk that the Group becomes insolvent due to uncertain liquidity caused by unexpected cash outflows, or a risk of borrowing 
high interest debts or disposal of liquid and other assets at a substantial discount.  The Group manages its liquidity risk through analysis of the 
contractual maturity of interest-bearing assets and liabilities, assets and liabilities related to the other financing, and off-balance sheet items 
related to cash flow of currency derivative instruments and others.
 
Cash flows disclosed for the maturity analysis are undiscounted contractual principal and interest to be received (paid) and; thus, are not identical to the 
amount in the financial statements that are based on the present value of expected cash flows in some cases. The amount of interest to be received or 
paid on floating rate assets and liabilities is measured on the assumption that the current interest rate would be the same through the maturity.116 FINANCIAL SECTION4.3.2. Liquidity risk management and indicator
 
The liquidity risk is managed by risk management policy and liquidity risk management guidelines which are applied to the risk management 
policies and procedures that address all the possible risks that arise from the overall business of the Group.
 
The Group computes and manages cumulative liquidity gap and liquidity rate subject to all transactions that affect cash flow in Korean won and 
foreign currencies and off-balance sheet transactions in relation to the liquidity. The Group regularly reports to the Risk Planning Council and Risk 
Management Committee.4.3.3. Analysis of remaining contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities
 
Cash flows disclosed below are undiscounted contractual principal and interest to be received (paid) and; thus, are not identical to the amount in 
the consolidated financial statements that are based on the present value of expected cash flows. The amount of interest to be received or paid on 
floating rate assets and liabilities is measured on the assumption that the current interest rate would be the same through the maturity.
 
The remaining contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities, excluding derivatives held for cash flow hedging, as of December 31, 2018 and 
2017, are as follows:OndemandUp to1 month1-3months(In millions of Korean won)2018

4.4.1 Concept
 
Market risk represents possible losses which arise from changes in market factors including interest rate, stock price, foreign exchange rate and 
other market factors that affect the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments including securities and derivatives amongst others. The 
most significant risk associated with trading positions interest rate risks, currency risks and also, stock price risks. In addition, the Group is exposed 
to interest rate risks associated with non-trading positions. The Group classifies exposures to market risk into either trading or non-trading 
positions. The Group measures and manages market risk separately for each subsidiary.4.4.2 Risk management
 
The Group sets internal capital limits for market risk and interest rate risk and monitors the risks to manage the risk of trading and non-trading 
positions. The Group maintains risk management systems and procedures including trading policies and procedures, and market risk management 
guidelines for trading positions, and interest rate risk management guidelines for non-trading positions in order to manage market risk 
efficiently. The procedures mentioned are implemented with approval from the Risk Management Committee and Risk Management Council.Kookmin Bank, one of the subsidiaries, establishes market risk management policy, sets position limits, loss limits and VaR limits of each business 
group and approves newly developed instruments through its Risk Management Council. The Market Risk Management Committee, which is 
chaired by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), is the decision maker and sets position limits, loss limits, VaR limits, sensitivity limits and scenario loss limits 
for each division, at the level of each individual business department.
 
The Asset-Liability Management Committee(ALCO) of Kookmin Bank determines the operational standards of interest and commission, the 
details of the establishment and prosecution of the Asset Liability Management (ALM) policies and enacts and amends relevant guidelines. The120 FINANCIAL SECTIONRisk Management Committee and Risk Management Council monitor the establishment and enforcement of ALM risk management policies, and 
enact and amend ALM risk management guidelines. The interest rate risk limit is set based on the future assets/liabilities position and interest rate 
volatility estimation reflects the annual work plan. The Financial Planning Department and Risk Management Department measures and monitors 
the interest risk status and limits on a regular basis. The status and limits of interest rate risks including interest gap, duration gap and interest rate 
VaR (Value at Risk), are reported to the ALCO and Risk Management Council on a monthly basis and to the Risk Management Committee on a 
quarterly basis. To ensure adequacy of interest rate and liquidity risk management, the Risk Management Department assigns the limits, monitors 
and reviews the risk management procedures and tasks conducted by the Financial Planning Department. Also, the Risk Management Department 
independently reports related information to the management.4.4.3 Trading PositionDefinition of a trading position
 
Trading positions subject to market risk management are defined under the Trading Policy and Guideline, and the basic requirements are as follows:
 
– The trading position is not restricted for sale, is measured daily at fair value, and its significant inherent risks are able to be hedged in the market.
–  The criteria for classification as a trading position are clearly defined in the Trading Policy and Guideline, and separately managed by the tradingdepartment.– The trading position is operated in accordance with the documented trading strategy and managed through position limits.
–  The operating department or professional dealers have an authority to enforce a deal on the trading position within predetermined limits withoutpre-approval.– The trading position is reported periodically to management for the purpose of the Group’s risk management
 
Observation method on market risk arising from trading positionsSubsidiaries of the Group calculate VaR to measure the market risk by using market risk management systems on the entire trading 
portfolio. Generally, the Group manages market risk on the trading portfolio. In addition, the Group controls and manages the risk of derivative 
trading based on the regulations and guidelines formulated by the Financial Supervisory Service.
 
VaR (Value at Risk)
 
i. VaR (Value at Risk)Kookmin Bank, one of the subsidiaries, uses the value-at-risk methodology to measure the market risk of trading positions. Kookmin Bank uses the 10-
day VaR, which estimates the maximum amount of loss that could occur in ten days under an historical simulation model which is considered to be a full 
valuation method. The distributions of portfolio's value changes are estimated based on the data over the previous 250 business days, and ten-day VaR 
is calculated by subtracting net present market value from the value measured at a 99% confident level of portfolio's value distribution results.  
 
VaR is a commonly used market risk measurement technique.  However, the method has some shortcomings. VaR estimates possible losses over 
a certain period at a particular confidence level using past market movement data. Past market movements are, however, not necessarily a good 
indicator of future events, as there may be conditions and circumstances in the future that the model does not anticipate. As a result, the timing 
and magnitude of the actual losses may vary depending on the assumptions made at the time of the calculation.  In addition, the time periods used 
for the model, generally one or ten days, are assumed to be a sufficient holding period before liquidating the relevant underlying positions. If these 
holding periods are not sufficient, or too long, the VaR results may understate or overstate the potential loss.
 
A subsidiary which holds trading positions uses an internal model (VaR) to measure general risk, and a standard method to measure each individual 
risk. When the internal model is not permitted for certain market risk, the Group uses the standard method. Therefore, the market risk VaR mayKB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018121not reflect the market risk of each individual risk and some specific positions. And also, non-banking subsidiaries use the same standard method 
applied to measure regulatory capital for improvement of market risk VaR management utility (improvement of relation with regulatory capital).
 
ii. Back-Testing
 
Back-testing is conducted on a daily basis to validate the adequacy of the market risk model.  In back-testing, the Group compares both the actual 
and hypothetical profit and loss with the VaR calculations.
 
iii. Stress Testing
 
Stress testing is carried out to analyze the impact of abnormal market situations on the trading and available-for-sale portfolio.  It reflects changes 
in interest rates, stock prices, foreign exchange rates, implied volatilities of derivatives and other risk factors that have significant influence on the 
value of the portfolio. The Group uses historical scenarios and hypothetical scenarios for the analysis of abnormal market situations.  Stress testing 
is performed at least once every year.
 
VaR at a 99% confidence level of interest rate, stock price and foreign exchange rate risk for trading positions with a ten-day holding period by a 
subsidiary as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:

i. Interest rate risk
 
Trading position interest rate risk usually arises from debt securities denominated in Korean won. The Group’s trading strategy is to benefit from 
short-term movements in the prices of debt securities arising from changes in interest rates. The Group manages interest rate risk on trading 
positions using market value-based tools such as VaR and sensitivity analysis (Price Value of a Basis Point: PVBP).
 
ii. Stock price risk
Stock price risk only arises from trading securities denominated in Korean won as the Group does not have any trading exposure to shares 
denominated in foreign currencies. The trading securities portfolio in Korean won are composed of exchange-traded stocks and derivative 
instruments linked to stock with strict limits on diversification. 
 
iii. Foreign exchange rate risk
 
Foreign exchange rate risk arises from holding assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency and foreign currency derivatives.  Net foreign 
currency exposure mostly occurs from the foreign assets and liabilities which are denominated in US dollars and Chinese Yuan. The Group sets both 
loss limits and net foreign currency exposure limits and manages comprehensive net foreign exchange exposures which consider both trading and 
non-trading portfolios.4.4.4 Non-trading position
 
Definition of non-trading position
 
Managed interest rate risk in non-trading position includes on- or off-balance sheet assets, liabilities and derivatives that are sensitive to interest 
rate, except trading position for market risk. The interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are interest-bearing assets and liabilities that create 
interest income and expenses.
 
Observation method on market risk arising from non-trading position
 
Interest rate risk occurs due to mismatches on maturities and interest rate reset periods between interest-bearing assets and liabilities. The Group 
manages the risk through measuring and managing interest rate VaR and earning at risk(EaR) that are maximum expected decreases in net asset 
value (NPV) and net interest income (NII) for one year, respectively, arising from unfavorable changes in market interest rate.
 
Interest Rate VaR
 
Interest rate VaR is the maximum possible loss due to interest rate risk under a normal distribution at a 99.9% confidence level. The measurement 
results of risk as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:(In millions of Korean won)Kookmin Bank

3,3394.5 Operational Risk
 
4.5.1 Concept
 
The Group defines operational risk broadly to include all financial and non-financial risks that may arise from operating activities and could cause a 
negative effect on capital.4.5.2 Risk management
 
The purpose of operational risk management is not only to comply with supervisory and regulatory requirements but also to promote a risk 
management culture, strengthen internal controls, innovate processes and provide timely feedback to management and employees. In addition, 
Kookmin Bank established Business Continuity Plans (BCP) to ensure critical business functions can be maintained, or restored, in the event of 
material disruptions arising from internal or external events. It has constructed replacement facilities as well as has carried out exercise drills for 
head office and IT departments to test its BCPs.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 20181274.6. Capital Adequacy
 
The Group complies with the capital adequacy standard established by the Financial Services Commission. The capital adequacy standard is based 
on Basel III published by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Bank of International Settlements in June 2011, and was implemented in Korea 
in December 2013. The Group is required to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 7.125%(2017: 6.250%), a minimum Tier 1 
ratio of 8.625%(2017: 7.750%) and a minimum Total Regulatory Capital of 10.625%(2017: 9.75%) as of December 31, 2018.
 
The Group's equity capital is classified into three categories in accordance with the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory Regulations 
on Financial Holding Companies:
 
-  Common Equity Tier 1 Capital: Common equity Tier 1 Capital represents the issued capital that takes the first and proportionately greatest share 
of any losses and represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the Group, and not repaid outside of liquidation.  It includes common 
shares issued, capital surplus, retained earnings, non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, accumulated other comprehensive income, 
other capital surplus and others.-  Additional Tier 1 Capital: Additional Tier 1 Capital includes (i) perpetual instruments issued by the Group that meet the criteria for inclusion inAdditional Tier 1 capital, and (ii) stock surplus resulting from the issue of instruments included in Additional Tier 1 capital and others.-  Tier 2 Capital: Tier 2 Capital represents the capital that takes the proportionate share of losses in the liquidation of the Group.  Tier 2 Capital 
includes a fund raised by issuing subordinated debentures maturing in not less than five years that meet the criteria for inclusion in Additional Tier 
2 capital, and the allowance for loan losses which are accumulated for assets classified as normal or precautionary as a result of classification of 
asset soundness in accordance with Regulation on Supervision of Financial Holding Companies and others.Risk weighted asset means the inherent risks in the total assets held by the Group. The Group calculates risk weighted asset by each risk (credit risk, 
market risk, and operational risk) based on the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory Regulations on Financial Holding Companies and 
uses it for BIS ratio calculation.
 
The Group assesses and monitors its adequacy of capital by using the internal assessment and management policy of the capital adequacy. The 
assessment of the capital adequacy is conducted by comparing available capital (actual amount of available capital) and internal capital (amount 
of capital enough to cover all significant risks under target credit rate set by the Group). The Group monitors the soundness of finance and provides 
risk adjusted basis for performance review using the assessment of the capital adequacy.
 
Internal Capital is the amount of capital to prevent the inability of payment due to unexpected loss in the future. The Group measures, allocates 
and monitors internal capital by risk type and subsidiaries.
 
The Risk Management Council of the Group determines the Group’s risk appetite and allocates internal capital by risk type and subsidiary.  Each 
subsidiary efficiently operates its capital within a range of allocated internal capital. The Risk Management Department of the Group monitors the 
limit on internal capital and reports the results to management and the Risk Management Council. The Group maintains the adequacy of capital 
through proactive review and approval of the Risk Management Committee when the internal capital is expected to exceed the limits due to new 
business or business expansion.128 FINANCIAL SECTIONDetails of the Group's capital adequacy calculation in line with Basel III requirements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:Equity Capital:

 362,931,715The fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an ordinary transaction between market 
participants.  For each class of financial assets and financial liabilities, the Group discloses the fair value of that class of assets and liabilities in 
a way that permits it to be compared with its carrying amount at the end of each reporting period.  The best evidence of fair value of financial 
instruments is a quoted price in an active market.134 FINANCIAL SECTIONMethods of determining fair value for financial instruments are as follows:Cash and due from financial 
institutionsInvestment securitiesLoans at amortized costDerivatives and Financial 
instruments at fair value 
through profit or lossDepositsDebtsDebenturesThe carrying amounts of cash and demand due from financial institutions and payment due from financial 
institutions are a reasonable approximation of fair values. These financial instruments do not have a fixed 
maturity and are receivable on demand. Fair value of ordinary due from financial institutions is measured using 
DCF model (Discounted Cash Flow Model).The fair value of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets is determined using the quoted prices. Fairvalue is determined through the use of external professional valuation institution where quoted prices are not 
available. The institutions use one or more of the following valuation techniques including DCF Model, Free Cash 
Flow to Equity Model, Comparable Company Analysis, Dividend Discount Model, Risk Adjusted Discount Rate 
Method, and Net Asset Value Method.DCF model is used to determine the fair value of loans. Fair value is determined by discounting the expected cash 
flows, which are contractual cash flows adjusted by the expected prepayment rate, at appropriate discount rate.For exchange traded derivatives, quoted price in an active market is used to determine fair value and for OTCderivatives, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. The Group uses internally developed valuation 
models that are widely used by market participants to determine fair values of plain vanilla OTC derivatives 
including options, interest rate swaps, and currency swaps, based on observable market parameters. However, 
some complex financial instruments are valued using appropriate models developed from generally accepted 
market valuation models including the Finite Difference Method, the Monte Carlo Simulation, Black-Scholes 
Model, Hull and White Model, Closed Form and Tree Model or valuation results from independent external 
professional valuation institution.Carrying amount of demand deposits is regarded as representative of fair value because they do not have a fixed 
maturity and are payable on demand. Fair value of time deposits is determined using a DCF model.  Fair value is 
determined by discounting the expected cash flows, which are contractual cash flows adjusted by the expected 
prepayment rate, at an appropriate discount rate.Carrying amount of overdraft in foreign currency is regarded as representative of fair value because they do not 
have a fixed maturity and are payable on demand. Fair value of other debts is determined using a DCF model 
discounting contractual future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate.Fair value is determined by using the valuations of external professional valuation institution, which are calculatedusing market inputs.Other financial assets and 
liabilitiesThe carrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair values. These financial instruments are temporaryaccounts used for other various transactions and their maturities are relatively short or not defined.  However, 
fair value of finance lease liabilities is measured using a DCF model.6.1.2 Fair value hierarchy
 
The Group believes that valuation methods used for measuring the fair values of financial instruments are reasonable and that the fair values 
recognized in the statements of financial position are appropriate. However, the fair values of the financial instruments recognized in the statements 
of financial position may be different if other valuation methods or assumptions are used. Additionally, as there is a variety of valuation techniques 
and assumptions used in measuring fair value, it may be difficult to reasonably compare the fair value with that of other financial institutions.
 
The Group classifies and discloses fair value of the financial instruments into the three-level hierarchy as follows: 
 
Level 1: The fair values are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018135Level 2: The fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly or indirectly.
 
Level 3: The fair values are based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety shall be determined on the basis of 
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed 
against the fair value measurement in its entirety. If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on 
unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement.

\ 116,629 as of December 31, 2017.  These equity securities are carried at cost because it is practically difficult to quantify the intrinsic values of the equity securities issued 
by unlisted public and non-profit entities.  In addition, due to significant fluctuations in estimated cash flows arising from entities being in its initial stages, which further results

which are affected by the unobservable parameters, using a statistical technique. When the fair value is affected by more than two input parameters, 
the amounts represent the most favorable or most unfavorable Level 3 financial instruments subject to sensitivity analysis are (i) equity-related 
derivatives, currency-related derivatives and interest rate related derivatives whose fair value changes are recognized in profit or loss, (ii) financial 
liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, and (iii) due from financial institutions, debt securities, equity securities and loan receivables 
whose fair value changes are recognized in profit or loss or other comprehensive income. If overlay approach is applied in accordance with Korean 
IFRS 1104, changes in fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognized as other comprehensive income.

    -KB Financial Group  Annual Report 20181491  For financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss, the changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters such as volatility 
of the underlying asset or correlation between underlying asset by ± 10%.
2  For stock and index-related derivatives, the changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters such as the correlation of rates of return 
on stocks and the volatility of the underlying asset by ± 10%. For currency-related derivatives, the changes in fair value are calculated by shifting the unobservable input 
parameters, such as the loss given default ratio by ± 1%. For interest rate-related derivatives, the correlation of the interest rates or the volatility of the underlying 
asset is shifted by ± 10% to calculate the fair value changes. 
3 For debt securities, the changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters; such as, discount rate by ± 1%.
4  For equity securities, the changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters such as correlation between growth rate (0~0.5%) and 
discount rate, liquidation value (-1~1%) and discount rate, or recovery rate of receivables' acquisition cost (-1~1%). Sensitivity of fair values to unobservable parameters of 
private equity fund is practically impossible, but in the case of equity fund composed of real estates, the changes in fair value are calculated by shifting correlation between 
discount rate (-1~1%) and volatilities of real estate price (-1~1%).6.2.4 Day one gain or loss
 
If the Group uses a valuation technique that incorporates data not obtained from observable markets for the fair value at initial recognition of 
financial instruments, there could be a difference between the transaction price and the amount determined using that valuation technique.  In 
these circumstances, the fair value of financial instruments is recognized as the transaction price, and the difference is deferred and not recognized 
in profit or loss, and is amortized by using the straight-line method over the life of the financial instrument. When the fair value of the financial 
instruments is subsequently determined using observable market inputs, the remaining deferred amount is recognized in profit or loss.
 
The aggregate difference yet to be recognized in profit or loss at the beginning and end of the period and a reconciliation of changes in the 
balance of this difference for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:Balance at the beginning of the period

  762,4081  The Group has an obligation to early redeem the asset-backed debentures upon occurrence of an event specified in the agreement such as when the outstanding balance 
of the eligible asset-backed securitization (ABS), a trust-type ABS, is below the solvency margin ratio(minimum rate: 104.5%) of the beneficiary interest in the trust.  To avoid 
such early redemption, the Group entrusts accounts and deposits in addition to the previously entrusted card accounts.
2  According to the liquidity facility agreement entered between the Special Purpose Companies (SPC) and Woori Bank and NH Bank, if the senior debentures cannot be 
redeemed by the underlying assets, the senior debentures should be redeemed by borrowings from the liquidity facilities.The Group transferred the beneficiary certificates to Yuanta Securities at \ 74,853 million and entered into a total return swap contract. If the fair 
value of the transferred asset changes, the risk is attributed to the company in accordance with the contract. The details of transferred financial 
assets as of December 31, 2018 are as follows.Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss(In millions of Korean won)2018Carrying amount of

The Group continues to recognize the financial assets related to repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions on the statements of 
financial position since those transactions are not qualified for derecognition even though the Group transfers the financial assets. A financial asset 
is sold under a repurchase agreement to repurchase the same asset at a fixed price, or loaned under a securities lending agreement to be returned 
as the same asset. Thus, the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. The amounts of transferred

The Group enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with 
the Group's derivative and spot exchange counterparties. Similar netting agreements are also entered into with the Group’s reverse repurchase, 
securities and others. Pursuant to these agreements, in the event of default by one party, contracts are to be terminated and receivables and 
payables are to be offset. Further, as the law allows for the right to offset, domestic uncollected receivables balances and domestic accrued 
liabilities balances are shown in its net settlement balance in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The Group’s derivative operations focus on addressing the needs of the Group’s corporate clients to hedge their risk exposure and to hedge the 
Group’s risk exposure that results from such client contracts. The Group also engages in derivative trading activities to hedge the interest rate 
and foreign currency risk exposures that arise from the Group’s own assets and liabilities. In addition, the Group engages in proprietary trading of 
derivatives within the Group’s regulated open position limits.
 
The Group provides and trades a range of derivatives products, including: 
 
- Interest rate swaps, relating to interest rate risks in Korean won
- Cross-currency swaps, forwards and options relating to foreign exchange rate risks,
- Stock price index options linked with the KOSPI index.
 
In particular, the Group applies fair value hedge accounting using cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps and others to hedge the risk of changes in 
fair values due to the changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates of structured debts in Korean won, financial debentures in foreign currencies, 
structured deposits in Korean won, and structured deposits in foreign currencies. In addition, the Group applies net investment hedge accounting by 
designating financial debentures in foreign currencies as hedging instruments to hedge foreign exchange risks on net investments in foreign operations.

2 The amount occurred from formerly known as KB Investment&Securities Co., Ltd.
 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units, based on management’s analysis, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination for impairment testing, and cash-generating units consist of an operating segment or units which are not larger than an operating 
segment. The Group recognized the amount of \ 65,288 million related to goodwill acquired in the merger of Housing & Commercial Bank. Of 
those respective amounts, the amounts of \ 49,315 million and \ 15,973 million were allocated to the Retail Banking and Corporate Banking, 
respectively. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that 
the unit may be impaired, by comparing the carrying amount of the unit, including the goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the unit.
 
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is measured at the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The fair value 
less costs to sell is the amount obtainable from the sale in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs 
of disposal. If it is difficult to measure the amount obtainable from the sale, the Group measures the fair value less costs to sell by reflecting the 
characteristics of the measured cash-generating unit. If it is not possible to obtain reliable information to measure the fair value less costs to 
sell, the Group uses the asset’s value in use as its recoverable amount. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be 
derived from an asset or cash-generating unit. The projections of the future cash flows are based on the most recent financial budget approved 
by management and generally cover a period of five years. The future cash flows after projection period are estimated on the assumption that the 
future cash flows will increase by 1.0% for all other cash-generating units. The key assumptions used for the estimation of the future cash flows are 
the market size and the Group’s market share. The discount rate is a pre-tax rate that reflects assumptions regarding risk-free interest rate, market 
risk premium and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.Details of intangible assets, excluding goodwill, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:Industrial property rights

24. Net Defined Benefit Liabilities (assets)Defined benefit plan
 
The Group operates defined benefit plans which have the following characteristics:
 
- The Group has the obligation to pay the agreed benefits to all its current and former employees.
- Actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more than expected) and investment risk fall, in substance, on the Group.
 
The defined benefit liability recognized in the statements of financial position is calculated by independent actuaries in accordance with actuarial 
valuation methods.
 
The net defined benefit obligation is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit method (the ‘PUC’). Data used in the PUC such as interest rates, 
future salary increase rate, mortality rate and consumer price index are based on observable market data and historical data which are updated 
annually.  
 
Actuarial assumptions may differ from actual results, due to changes in the market, economic trends and mortality trends which may impact 
defined benefit liabilities and future payments. Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in the period 
incurred through other comprehensive income.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018203Changes in the net defined benefit liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:Present value ofdefined benefit obligation2018Fair value of

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all 
dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group’s dilutive potential ordinary shares include stock grants. 
 
A calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average market share 
price of the Group’s outstanding shares for the period) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the share options. The 
number of shares calculated above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of stock grants.

Insurance risk is the risk that arises from a primary operation of insurance companies that is associated with acceptance of insurance contract and 
payment of claims, and is classified as the insurance price risk and the reserves risk. The insurance price risk is the risk of loss that might occur 
when the actual risk exceeds the expected risk rate or expected insurance operating expenses ratios in calculation of premiums. It is the risk of loss 
that arises from differences between actual payment of claims and premiums received from policyholders. The reserves risk is the risk that arises 
due to a deficit in reserves at the date of assessment, making the Group unable to cover the actual claims payment in the future.
 
37.5.2 Purposes, policies and procedures to manage risk arising from insurance contracts
 
The risks associated with insurance contract that the Group faces are the insurance actuarial risk and the acceptance risk. Each risk occurs due to 
insurance contract’s pricing and conditions of acceptance. In order to minimize acceptance risk, the Group establishes guidelines and procedure 
for acceptance and outlines specific conditions for acceptance by product. In addition, expected risk level at the date of pricing is compared with 
actual risk of contracts after acceptance and various subsequent measures such as the adjustments in the interest rate and sales conditions, 
termination of selling specific product and others are taken in order to reduce insurance actuarial risk. The Group has a committee to discuss 
status of product acceptance risk and interest rate policy. The committee decides important matters to set the processes that allow minimizing the 
insurance actuarial risk, the acceptance risk and other business related risk.
 
In addition, according to reinsurance operating standards, the Group establishes an operating strategy of reinsurance for large claims expense due 
to unexpected catastrophic events. The Group aims at policy holders' safety and its stable profit achievement. For the long-term goal, the Group 
manages risk at a comprehensive level to keep its value at the maximum.236 FINANCIAL SECTION37.5.3 Exposure to insurance price risk
 
According to RBC standard, exposure to insurance price risk is defined as net written premiums for prior one year that is calculated by adding and 
subtracting original insurance premium, assumed reinsurance premium and ceded reinsurance premium.
 
The Group’s exposure to insurance price risk as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, as follows:2018(In millions of Korean won)Direct

The Group is selling general non-life insurances (fire, maritime, injury, technology, liability, package, title, guarantee and special type insurances), 
automobile insurances (for private use, for hire, for business, bicycle and other), long-term insurances (long-term non-life, property damage, injury, 
driver, savings, illness, nursing and pension) and various other insurances. The Group’s risk is distributed through reinsurance, joint acceptance 
and diversified selling. In addition, insurances that cover severe level of risk, although there is rare possibility of the occurrence of disaster, such as 
storm and flood insurance are limited, and the Group controls the risk through joint acquisition.
 
Loss development tables
 
The Group uses claim development of payments and the estimated ultimate claims for the years where the accident has occurred, in order to 
maintain overall reserve adequacy in respect of general, automobile and long-term insurance. When the estimated ultimate claims are greater than 
claim payments, the Group establishes additional reserves. Loss development tables as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018237<2018>

Credit risk of insurance contract is the economic loss arising from non-performing contractual obligations due to decline in credit ratings or 
default. Through strict internal review, only the insurers rated above BBB- of S&P rating are accepted for the insurance contracts.
 
As of December 31, 2018, there are 155 reinsurance companies that deal with the Group, and the top three reinsurance companies’ concentration 
and credit ratings are as follows:242 FINANCIAL SECTIONKOREAN RE

The interest rate risk exposure from the Group’s insurance contracts is the risk of unexpected losses in net interest income or net assets arising 
from changes in interest rates and it is managed to minimize the loss experienced. For long-term, non-life insurance contracts, the Group 
calculates exposure of interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Liabilities exposure is premium reserves after subtracting costs of 
termination deductions. Asset exposure is interest-bearing assets. Assets that receive only fees without interest are excluded from interest bearing 
assets. Exposures to interest rate risk as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:

Duration is used to measure interest rate risk within risk based solvency test.  ALM system is utilized to manage interest rate risk internally.  In 
addition, Risk Management Committee sets ALM strategy every year to manage interest rate risk.
 
iii) Sensitivity to changes in interest rates
Generally, when interest rates rise, the value and duration of assets and liabilities fall when interest rates fall, value and duration of assets and 
liabilities increase. Where duration of assets is shorter than that of liabilities with the interest rates fall, the interest risk is increased since the 
incremental portion of liabilities exceeds that of assets.
 
iv) Negative spread risk control
In order to manage the reverse margins risk between interest expenses from liabilities and investment incomes on assets, the Group set the 
disclosure rate every month considering the market interest rate and the managing portfolio's profit ratio.37.6 Risk management of life insurance
 
37.6.1 Overview
 
Insurance risk is the risk of loss arising from the actual risk at the time of claims exceeding the estimated risk at the time of underwriting.  Insurance 
risk is classified by insurance price risk and policy reserve risk.
 
Insurance price risk is the risk of loss arising from differences between received from policyholders and actual claims paid.
 
Policy reserve risk is the risk of loss arising from differences between policy reserves the Group holds and actual claims to be paid.
 
The Group measures only insurance price risk under RBC requirement because life insurance claim payout is mainly in a fixed amount with less 
volatility in policy reserve and shorter waiting period before payment37.6.2 Concentration of insurance risk and reinsurance policy
 
The Group uses reinsurance to mitigate concentration of insurance risk seeking an enhanced capital management.
 
The Group categorized reinsurance into group and individual contracts, and reinsurance is ceded through the following process:244 FINANCIAL SECTIONThe Group’s reinsurance is ceded through the following process:
 
i.  In the decision-making process of launching a new product, the Group makes a decision on ceding reinsurance. Subsequently, a reinsurer isselected through bidding, agreements with the relevant departments and final approval by the executive management.ii.  The reinsurance department analyzes the object of reinsurance, the maximum limit of reinsurance and the loss ratio with the relevantdepartments.37.6.3 The characteristic and exposure of insurance price risk
 
The exposure of insurance price risk is measured by the risk premium for all insurance contracts held for one year prior to the calculation date. The 
premium for risk retention is calculated by adding direct insurance premium and reinsurance assumed premium, and deducting reinsurance ceded 
premium (which is paid to reinsurance companies). If the holding risk premium is less than zero, the exposure of the insurance price is measured as 
zero.
 
The insurance risk of a life insurance company is measured by insurance price risk. As the life insurance coverage is in the form of a fixed payment, 
the fluctuation of policy reserve is small and the period from insured event to claims payment is not long. The policy reserve risk is managed by 
assessments of adequacy of the policy reserve.
 
The insurance price risk is managed through insurance risk management regulation established by Risk Management Committee.
 
The maximum exposures to insurance price risk as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:Death
Disability
Hospitalization
Operation and diagnosis
Actual losses for medical expense

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audits in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with 
the ethical requirements of the Republic of Korea that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements and we have fulfilled our other ethical

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the separate financial statements in accordance with Korean IFRS, and 
for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.In preparing the  financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the 
Company or to cease operations. 
 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018285Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
 
As  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  Korean  Standards  on  Auditing,  we  exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional  skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:˙ Identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the   financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  auditprocedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.management.not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control.˙ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but 
˙ Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and  related  disclosures  made  by 
˙Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.˙Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statementsrepresent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, 
and  to  communicate  with  them  all  relationships  and  other  matters  that  may  reasonably  be  thought  to  bear  on  our  independence,  and  where 
applicable, related safeguards.

position, financial performance or cash flows, is not presented in the accompanying separate financial statements. 
 
The separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Korean IFRS. These are the standards, subsequent 
amendments and related interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") that have been adopted by the Republic 
of Korea.
 
The preparation of separate financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. Management also needs to exercise 
judgment in applying the Company's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the separate financial statements are disclosed in Note 2.4. 
 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Korean IFRS which is effective or early adopted as of December 31, 2018. 
 
The Company has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual reporting period commencing January 1, 
2018.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018291- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1028 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
 
Amendments to Korean IFRS 1028 clarifies that a venture capital organization or a mutual fund, and similar entities may elect, at initial recognition, 
to measure investments in an associate or joint venture at fair value through profit or loss separately for each associate or joint venture.
 
- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1040 Transfers of Investment Property
 
Amendments to Korean IFRS 1040 clarifies that a transfer to, or from, investment property, including property under construction, can only be 
made if there has been a change in use that is supported by evidence. Paragraph 57 of the standard provides a list of such circumstances as 
examples.  
 
- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1102 Share-based PaymentAmendments to Korean IFRS 1102 clarifies accounting for a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the 
classification of the transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled. And also, clarifies that the measurement approach should treat the terms and 
conditions of a cash-settled award in the same way as for an equity-settled award.  
 
- Enactment of Korean IFRS 2122 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration
 
According to the enacted interpretation, the date of the transaction, for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition 
of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it) is the date on which an entity initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary 
liability arising from the prepayment or receipt of advance consideration. In case there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the entity 
should determine a date of the transaction for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.- Enactment of Korean IFRS 1109 Financial InstrumentsThe Company has adopted Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments with a date of initial application of January 1, 2018. As permitted by the 
transition requirements of Korean IFRS 1109, comparative periods have not been restated. The adoption does not have a significant impact on the 
financial statements.
 
- Enactment of Korean IFRS 1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 
The Company has adopted Korean IFRS 1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. As permitted by the transition requirements of Korean IFRS 
1115, comparative periods have not been restated. The amendments does not have a significant impact on the financial statements.
 
Certain new accounting standards and interpretations that have been published but are not mandatory for annual reporting period commencing 
January 1, 2018 and have not been early adopted by the Company are set out below. The Company expects the effect on the financial 
statements applying the new standard will not be significant, with the exception of the adoption of Korean IFRS 1116 Lease
 
- Korean IFRS 1116 Leases
 
Korean IFRS 1116 Leases issued on May 22, 2017 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption 
permitted. This standard will replace Korean IFRS 1017 Leases, Interpretation Korean IFRS 2104 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a 
Lease, Interpretation 2015 Operating Leases-Incentives, and Interpretation 2027 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form 
of a Lease.
 
At inception of a contract, the Company shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Also, at the date of initial application, the Company 
shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease in accordance with the standard. However, the Company may not need to reassess all 
contracts, if the Company elects to apply the practical expedient not to apply the standard to contracts that were entered into before the date of 
initial application. At the date of initial application, the Company will assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease at inception of a contract.292 FINANCIAL SECTIONFor a contract that is, or contains, a lease, the Company shall account for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from 
non-lease components of the contract. In addition, as a practical expedient, the lessee may elect, by class of underlying asset, not to separate 
non-lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as 
a single lease component. For the all (or partial) lease agreements, or the agreements including lease components, the Company plans to apply 
account the practical expedient to account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease agreement.
 
A lessee is required to recognize a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its 
obligation to make lease payments. The lessee may elect not to apply the requirements to short-term lease (a lease term of 12 months or less at 
the commencement date) and low value assets (e.g. underlying assets below $ 5,000). The Company plans not to apply the requirements to real 
estates rent for single-use (a lease for education and others) and low value assets (e.g. underlying assets below \ 5 million and $ 5,000). 
 
In relation with sale and leaseback transactions, the Company(the seller-lessee) shall apply the requirements for determining when a performance 
obligation is satisfied in Korean IFRS 1115 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' to determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for 
as a sale of that asset. However, for those transactions before the date of initial application, the Company shall not reassess them.
 
The accounting treatment as a lessor did not change significantly from the one under Korean IFRS 1017 Leases. The Bank expects the effect on 
the financial statements applying the new standard will not be significant as accounting for the Bank, as a lessor, will not significantly change.
 
A lessee shall apply this standard to its leases either (a) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented applying Korean IFRS 1008 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors (Full retrospective application); or (b) retrospectively with the cumulative effect of 
initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application.
 
The Company plans to apply Korean IFRS 1116 retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard and as such will not 
restate any comparative information.
 
The Company performed an impact assessment to identify potential financial effects of applying Korean IFRS 1116 based on available information 
as at December 31, 2018 to identify effects on 2019 financial statements.
 
The total minimum lease payment expected to be paid by the Company in relation to operating leases before discounted to their present value is 
\ 468 million. When the payment is discounted at incremental borrowing rate of the lessee, the total minimum lease payment amounts to \ 460 
million. As a result of the financial effects on the financial statements analyzed, the Company expects the underlying leased asset and a lease 
liability as at December 31, 2018 to be increased by \ 684 million and \ 460 million, respectively. The difference between the right-of-use asset 
and the lease liability has been arising from the adjustments made at the right-of-use asset for the lease contracts entered before the date of 
the adoption of this standard. On the other hand, the results of the assessment may change due to additional information that the Company may 
obtain after the assessment.
 
Enactment, Amendments and Annual Improvements
 
- Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments
 
The narrow-scope amendments made to Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments enable entities to measure certain prepayable financial assets 
with negative compensation at amortized cost. When a modification of a financial liability measured at amortized cost that does not result in the 
derecognition, a modification gain or loss shall be recognized in profit or loss.
 
- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1019 Employee Benefits
 
The amendments require that an entity shall calculate current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the reporting period after a plan 
amendment, curtailment or settlement based on updated actuarial assumptions from the date of the change. The amendments also require that 
a reduction in a surplus must be recognized in profit or loss even if that surplus was not previously recognized because of the impact of the asset 
ceiling.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018293- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1028 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
 
The amendments clarify that an entity shall apply Korean IFRS 1109 to financial instruments in an associate or joint venture to which the equity 
method is not applied. These include long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the entity’s net investment in an associate or joint venture. 
These amendments will be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In accordance with the 
transitional provisions in Korean IFRS 1109, the restatement of the comparative information is not required and the cumulative effects of initially 
applying the amendments retrospectively should be recognized in the beginning balance of retained earnings (or other components of equity, as 
appropriate) at the date of initial application.
 
- Enactment to Interpretation of Korean IFRS 2123 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
 
The enactment clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes in the event that the decision of taxation authorities or courts can change 
tax treatment. The enactment presents calculating methods of disclosure amount based on the possibility of future recognition of the income tax 
treatment, and requires disclosure of the uncertainty of the amount.
 
- Annual Improvements to Korean IFRS 1103 Business Combination
 
The amendments clarify that when a party to a joint arrangement obtains control of a business that is a joint operation, and had rights to the assets 
and obligations for the liabilities relating to that joint operation immediately before the acquisition date, the transaction is a business combination 
achieved in stages. In such cases, the acquirer shall remeasure its entire previously held interest in the joint operation.
 
- Annual Improvements to Korean IFRS 1111 Joint Agreements
 
The amendments clarify that when a party that participates in, but does not have joint control of, a joint operation might obtain joint control of the 
joint operation in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business. In such cases, previously held interests in the joint operation are 
not remeasured.
 
- Annual Improvements to Paragraph 57A of Korean IFRS 1012 Income Tax
 
The amendment is applied to all the income tax consequences of dividends and requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of 
dividends in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity according to where the entity originally recognized those past transactions or 
events. 
 
- Annual Improvements to Korean IFRS 1023 Borrowing Cost
 
The amendments clarify that if a specific borrowing remains outstanding after the related qualifying asset is ready for its intended use (or sale), it 
becomes part of general borrowings.2.2 Measurement Basis
 
The separate financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified.2.3 Functional and Presentation Currency 
 
Items included in the separate financial statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the Company operates (“the functional currency”). The separate financial statements are presented in Korean won, which is the Company’s 
functional and presentation currency.294 FINANCIAL SECTION2.4 Critical Accounting Estimates
 
The preparation of separate financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, certain critical accounting estimates and 
assumptions that may have a significant impact on the assets (liabilities) and incomes (expenses). Management’s estimates of outcomes may differ 
from actual outcomes if management’s estimates and assumptions based on management’s best judgment at the reporting date are different from 
the actual environment.
 
Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and any change in an accounting estimate is recognized prospectively by including it in profit 
or loss in the period of the change, if the change affects that period only. Alternatively, if the change in accounting estimate affects both the 
period of change and future periods, that change is recognized in the profit or loss of all those periods.
 
The significant accounting estimates and assumptions are consistently applied to all periods presented, except for the assumptions for income tax 
expense.3. Significant Accounting Policies
 
The significant accounting policies and calculation methods applied in the preparation of these separate financial statements have been 
consistently applied to all periods presented, except for the impact of changes due to enactment of new standards, amendments and 
interpretations disclosed in Note 2.1 and the following paragraph.3.1 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments
 
3.1.1 Initial recognition
 
The Company recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets (a purchase or sale of a financial asset under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the financial instruments within the time frame established generally by market regulation or practice) is recognized 
and derecognized using trade date accounting.
 
The Company classifies financial assets as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, or financial assets at amortized cost. The Company classifies financial liabilities as financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss, or other financial liabilities. The classification depends on the nature and holding purpose of the financial instrument at initial 
recognition in the separate financial statements.
 
At initial recognition, a financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial 
liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or 
financial liability.
  
The fair value is defined as the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an 
arm’s length transaction. The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (that is, the fair value of the 
consideration given or received) in an arm’s length transaction.3.1.2 Subsequent measurement
 
After initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at amortized cost or fair value based on classification at initial recognition.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018295Amortized cost
 
The amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial 
recognition:
 
- minus the principal repayments
-  plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturityamount- or any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance account) due to impairment or uncollectibility
 
Fair value
 
Fair values, which the Company primarily uses for the measurement of financial instruments, are the published price quotations based on market 
prices or dealer price quotations of financial instruments traded in an active market where available. These are the best evidence of fair value.  A 
financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, 
an entity in the same industry, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions 
on an arm's length basis. 
 
If the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is determined either by using a valuation technique or independent third-party 
valuation service.  Valuation techniques include using recent arm's length market transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, if available, 
referencing to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models. 
 
The Company uses valuation models that are commonly used by market participants and customized for the Company to determine fair values of 
common over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives such as options, interest rate swaps and currency swaps which are based on the inputs observable 
in markets.  For more complex instruments, the Company uses internally developed models, which are usually based on valuation methods and 
techniques generally used within the industry, or a value measured by an independent external valuation institution as the fair values if all or some 
of the inputs to the valuation models are not market observable and therefore it is necessary to estimate fair value based on certain assumptions.
 
In addition, the fair value information recognized in the statements of financial position is classified into the following fair value hierarchy, reflecting 
the significance of the input variables used in the fair value measurement.
 
Level 1 : quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date
Level 2 : inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 
Level 3 : unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety shall be determined on the basis of the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against 
the fair value measurement in its entirety.
 
If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 
measurement.  
 
If the valuation technique does not reflect all factors which market participants would consider in setting a price, the fair value is adjusted to reflect 
those factors.  Those factors include counterparty credit risk, bid-ask spread, liquidity risk and others.
 
The chosen valuation technique makes maximum use of market inputs and relies as little as possible on entity-specific inputs. It incorporates 
all factors that market participants would consider in setting a price and is consistent with economic methodologies applied for pricing financial 
instruments. Periodically, the Company calibrates the valuation technique and tests its validity using prices of observable current market 
transactions of the same instrument or based on other relevant observable market data.296 FINANCIAL SECTION3.1.3 Derecognition
 
Derecognition is the removal of a previously recognized financial asset or financial liability from the statement of financial position. The Company 
derecognizes a financial asset or a financial liability when, and only when:
 
Derecognition of financial assets
 
Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or the financial assets have 
been transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are also transferred, or all the risks and rewards 
of ownership of the financial assets are neither substantially transferred nor retained and the Company has not retained control. If the Company 
neither transfers nor disposes of substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets, the Company continues to recognize the 
financial asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the financial asset.
 
If the Company transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset, the Company continues to recognize the transferred asset in its entirety and recognize a financial liability for the 
consideration received.
 
The Company writes off financial assets in its entirety or to a portion thereof when the principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding 
are determined to be no longer recoverable. In general, the Company considers write-off if significant financial difficulties of the debtor, or 
delinquency in interest or principal payments is indicated. The write-off decision is made in accordance with internal regulations and may 
require approval from external institution, if necessary. After the write-off, the Company can collect the written-off loans continuously according 
to the internal policy. Recovered amounts of financial assets previously written-off are recognized at profit or loss.
 
Derecognition of financial liabilities
 
Financial liabilities are derecognized from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled 
or expires.3.1.4 Offsetting
 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the separate statements of financial position where there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the assets and settle the liability 
simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business 
and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty.3.2 Cash and Due from Financial Institutions
 
Cash and due from financial institutions include cash on hand, foreign currency, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and due from financial institutions.  Cash 
and due from financial institutions are measured at amortized cost.3.3 Non-derivative Financial Assets
 
3.3.1 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
 
Financial assets classified as held for trading, financial assets designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss upon initial 
recognition, and financial assets that are required to be mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss are classified as financial assets atKB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018297fair value through profit or loss.
 
The Company may designate certain financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss when the designation eliminates 
or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as 'an accounting mismatch') that would otherwise 
arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on different bases.
 
After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is measured at fair value and gains or losses arising from a change in 
the fair value are recognized in profit or loss.  Interest income and dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are also 
recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.3.3.2 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
 
The Company classifies below financial assets as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income;
-  debt instruments with a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, andconsistent with representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding or;-  equity instruments, not held for trading with the objective of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealer’smargin, designated as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive incomeAfter initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income is measured at fair value. Gain and loss from changes in 
fair value, other than dividend income and interest income amortized using effective interest method and exchange differences arising on monetary 
items which are recognized directly in income as interest income or expense, are recognized as other comprehensive income in equity.
 
At disposal of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, cumulative gain or loss is recognized as profit or loss for the 
reporting period. However, cumulative gain or loss of equity instrument designated as fair value through other comprehensive income are not 
recycled to profit or loss at disposal. 
 
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate. Exchange 
differences resulting from changes in amortized cost are recognized in profit or loss, and other changes are recognized as equity.3.3.3 Financial assets measured at amortized cost
 
A financial asset, which are held within the business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and 
consistent with representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are classified as a financial asset at 
amortized cost.
 
Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method after initial recognition and 
interest income is recognized using the effective interest method.3.4 Expected Credit Loss of Financial Assets (Debt Instruments)
 
The Company measures expected credit loss and recognizes loss allowance at the end of the reporting period for financial assets measured at 
amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income with the exception of financial asset measured at fair value through profit or 
loss.
 
Expected credit losses are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses (i.e. the present value of all cash shortfalls) over the expected life of 
the financial instrument.  The Company measures expected credit losses by reflecting reasonable and supportable information that is reasonably298 FINANCIAL SECTIONavailable at the reporting date without undue cost or effort, including information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future 
economic conditions.
 
The Company uses the following three measurement techniques in accordance with Korean IFRS: 
- General approach: for financial assets and off-balance-sheet unused credit line that are not applied below two approaches
- Simplified approach: for receivables, contract assets and lease receivables 
- Credit-impaired approach: for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets
 
Different measurement approaches are applied depending on significant increase in credit risk. 12 month expected credit losses is recognized 
when credit risk has not significantly increased since initial recognition. A loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses is 
recognized when credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition. Lifetime is presumed to be a period to the contractual maturity date 
of a financial asset (the expected life of the financial asset.
 
One or more of the following items is deemed significant increase in credit risk. When the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are 
renegotiated or otherwise modified, the Company determines whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition using the 
following information.
 
- more than 30 days past due;
- decline in credit rating at period end by more than certain notches as compared to that at initial recognition;
- debt restructuring (except for impaired financial assets); and
- credit delinquency information on Korea Federation of Banks, and etc. 
 
Under simplified approach, the Company shall always measure the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Under 
credit-impaired approach, the Company shall only recognize the cumulative changes in lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition as a 
loss allowance for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets. In assessing credit impairment, the Company uses definition of default 
as in the new Basel Accord which rules calculation of Capital Adequacy Ratio.
 
The Company generally deems one or more of the following items credit-impaired:
 
- no less than 90 days past due;
- legal proceedings related to collection;
- a borrower that has received a warning from the Korea Federation of banks;
- corporate borrowers that are rated C or D;
- debt restructuring.3.4.1 Forward-looking information 
 
The Company uses forward-looking information, when it determines whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition and 
measures expected credit losses.
 
The Company assumes the risk component has a certain correlation with the business cycle, and calculates the expected credit loss by reflecting 
the forward-looking information with macroeconomic variables on the measurement inputs.
 
Forward looking information used in calculation of expected credit loss is derived by KB Financial Group Research Institute after comprehensive 
consideration of a variety of factors including scenario in management planning, third party forecast, and others.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 20182993.4.2 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at amortized cost 
 
The amount of the loss on financial assets at amortized cost is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present 
value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.
 
The Company estimates expected future cash flows for financial assets that are individually significant (individual assessment of impairment).
 
For financial assets that are not individually significant, the Company collectively estimates expected credit loss by grouping loans with 
homogeneous credit risk profile (collective assessment of impairment).
 
Individual assessment of impairment
 
Individual assessment of impairment losses are calculated using management's best estimate on present value of expected future cashflows. The 
Company uses all the available information including operating cash flow of the borrower and net realizable value of any collateral held.  
 
Collective assessment of impairment
 
Collective assessment of loss allowance involves historical loss experience along with incorporation of forward-looking information. Such process 
incorporates factors such as type of collateral, product and borrowers, credit rating, size of portfolio and recovery period and applies Probability of 
Default(PD) on a group of assets and Loss Given Default(LGD) by type of recovery method. Also, the expected credit loss model involves certain 
assumption to determine input based on loss experience and forward-looking information. These models and assumptions are periodically reviewed 
to reduce gap between loss estimate and actual loss experience.
 
Lifetime expected credit loss as at the end of the reporting period is calculated by product of carrying amount net of expected repayment, PD for 
each period and LGD adjusted by change in carrying amount.3.4.3 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
 
Measuring method of expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is equal to the method of 
financial assets at amortized cost, except for loss allowances that are recognized as other comprehensive income. Amounts recognized in other 
comprehensive income for sale or repayment of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.3.5 Revenue Recognition
 
The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the following revenue recognition standard:
 
- Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer.
- Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
- Step 3: Determine the transaction price.
- Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
- Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.3.5.1 Interest income and expense
 
Interest income of financial assets at amortized cost and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and expense are 
recognized in statements of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.  The effective interest method is a method of calculating300 FINANCIAL SECTIONthe amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability (or groups of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income 
or interest expense over the relevant period. 
 
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial 
instrument or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. When calculating the 
effective interest rate, the Company estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider future 
credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid (main components of effective interest rates only) or received between parties to the 
contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts. In those rare cases when it is 
not possible to estimate reliably the cash flows or the expected life of a financial instrument (or group of financial instruments), the Company uses 
the contractual cash flows over the full contractual term of the financial instrument (or group of financial instruments).
 
Interest on impaired financial assets is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the 
impairment loss.
 
Interest earned arising from debt investments at fair value through profit or loss is also classified as interest income in statements of comprehensive 
income.3.5.2 Fee and commission income
 
The Company recognizes financial service fees in accordance with the accounting standard of the financial instrument related to the fees earned. 
 
Fees that are an integral part of the effective interest of a financial instrument
 
Such fees are generally treated as adjustments of effective interest. Such fees may include compensation for activities such as evaluating the 
borrower's financial condition, evaluating and recording guarantees, collateral and other security arrangements, negotiating the terms of the 
instrument, preparing and processing documents and closing the transaction and origination fees received on issuing financial liabilities measured 
at amortized cost. However, fees relating to the creation or acquisition of a financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss are recognized 
as revenue immediately.
 
Fees earned as services are provided
 
Such fees are recognized as revenue as the services are provided. Fees which can be earned through the certain periods, including account 
servicing fees, investment management fees, and etc, are recognized when the related services are provided.
 
Fees that are earned on the execution of a significant act
 
Such fees are recognized as revenue when the significant act has been completed.3.5.3 Net gains/losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss
 
Net gains/losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss include profit or loss (changes in fair value, dividends, and gain/loss 
from foreign currency translation) from following financial instruments:
 
- Gain or loss from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss 
- Gain or loss from derivatives for trading, including derivatives for hedging that does not meet the condition of hedge accountingKB Financial Group  Annual Report 20183013.5.4 Dividend income
 
Dividend income is recognized in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established. Dividend income is recognized as relevant items on 
statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in accordance with the classification of equity instruments.
 
 
3.6 Investments in Subsidiaries and Associates
 
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted at cost method in accordance with Korean IFRS 1027. The Company determines at each 
reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the investments in the subsidiaries and associates are impaired. If this is the case, 
the Company calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the subsidiaries or associates and its 
carrying value.3.7 Property and Equipment
 
Recognition and Measurement
 
All property and equipment that qualify for recognition as an asset are measured at its cost and subsequently carried at cost less any accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.  
 
The cost of property and equipment includes any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to 
be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and 
restoring the site on which it is located.
 
Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when they prolong the useful life or enhance values of the assets but the costs of the day-to-day 
servicing of the assets such as repair and maintenance costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.  When part of an item of an asset has a 
useful life different from that of the entire asset, it is recognized as a separate asset. 
 
Depreciation
 
Land is not depreciated, whereas other property and equipment are depreciated using the method that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s 
future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Company. The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its 
residual value.
 
Each part of an item of property and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.  
 
The depreciation method and estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:Property and equipment
Leasehold improvements
Equipment and vehiclesDepreciation methodDeclining-balance
Declining-balanceEstimated useful life4 years
4 yearsThe residual value, the useful life and the depreciation method applied to an asset are reviewed at each financial year-end and, if expectations 
differ from previous estimates or if there has been a significant change in the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits 
embodied in the asset, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.302 FINANCIAL SECTION3.8 Intangible Assets
 
Intangible assets are measured initially at cost and subsequently carried at their cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated 
impairment losses.
 
Intangible assets, except for membership right, are amortized using the straight-line method with no residual value over their estimated useful 
economic life since the asset is available for use.Intangible assetsAmortization methodEstimated useful lifeSoftware
OthersStraight-line
Straight-line4 years4 ~ 19 yearsThe amortization period and the amortization method for intangible assets with a definite or limited useful life are reviewed at each financial year 
end.  Where an intangible asset is not being amortized because its useful life is considered to be indefinite, the Company carries out a review in 
each accounting period to confirm whether or not events and circumstances still support the assumption of an indefinite useful life.  If they do not, 
the change from the indefinite to definite or limited useful life is accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.9 Impairment of Non-financial AssetsThe Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset except for (i) deferred income 
tax assets, (ii) assets arising from employee benefits and (iii) non-current assets (or group of assets to be sold) classified as held for sale, may be 
impaired.  If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
 
The recoverable amount is estimated for the individual asset.  If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, the 
Company determines the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs (the asset's cash-generating unit). A cash-
generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other 
assets or groups of assets. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is 
the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit that are discounted by a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have 
not been adjusted.
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. That 
reduction is an impairment loss and recognized immediately in profit or loss.3.10 Provisions
 
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching the 
best estimate of provisions, and where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of provisions are the present value of the 
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. 
 
Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provisions are reversed.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 20183033.11 Equity Instrument Issued by the Company
 
An equity instrument is any contract or agreement that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.  Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from the equity.3.12 Employee Compensation and Benefits
 
3.12.1 Post-employment benefit: 
 
Defined benefit plans
 
All post-employment benefit, other than defined contribution plans, is classified as defined benefit plans. The amount recognized as a defined 
benefit liability is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the end of the reporting period.
 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit method. The 
rate used to discount post-employment benefit obligations is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on 
high quality corporate bonds. The currency and term of the corporate bonds are consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-
employment benefit obligations. Actuarial gains and losses including experience adjustments and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions 
are recognized in other comprehensive income.
 
When the fair value of plan assets deducted from the total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation results in an asset, it is recognized 
to the extent of any cumulative unrecognized past service cost and the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds 
from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
 
Past service cost arises when the Company introduces a defined benefit plan that attributes to past service or changes the benefits payable for 
past service under an existing defined benefit plan. Such past service cost is recognized immediately in profit or loss.
 
Defined contribution plans
 
The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due.3.12.2 Short-term employee benefits
 
Short-term employee benefits are employee benefits (other than termination benefits) that are due to be settled within 12 months after the end 
of the period in which the employees render the related service. The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid 
in exchange for that service is recognized as a liability (accrued expense), after deducting any amount already paid.
 
The expected cost of profit-sharing and bonus payments are recognized as liabilities when the Company has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to make such payments as a result of past events rendered by employees and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.3.12.3 Share-based payment
 
The Company has share grant programs to directors and employees of the Company. When the stock grants are exercised, the Company can either 
select to issue new shares or distribute treasury shares, or compensate the difference in fair value of shares and exercise price.304 FINANCIAL SECTIONFor a share-based payment transaction in which the terms of the arrangement provide the Company with the choice of whether to settle in cash or 
by issuing equity instruments, the Company determined that it has a present obligation to settle in cash because the Company has a past practice 
and a stated policy of settling in cash. Therefore, the Company accounts for the transaction in accordance with the requirements of cash-settled 
share-based payment transactions.
 
The Company measures the services acquired and the liability incurred at fair value, and the fair value is recognized as expense and accrued 
expenses over the vesting period. Until the liability is settled, the Company remeasures the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting 
period and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the year.3.12.4 Termination benefits
 
Termination benefits are employee benefits provided in exchange for the termination of an employee’s employment as a result of either (a) the 
Company decision to terminate an employee’s employment before the normal retirement date; or (b) an employee’s decision to accept an offer 
of benefits in exchange for the termination of employment. The Company recognizes liabilities and expenses for termination benefits at the earlier 
of the following dates: when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Company recognizes costs for a 
restructuring that is within the scope of Korean IFRS 1037 and involves the payment of termination benefits. Termination benefits are measured by 
considering the number of employees expected to accept the offer in the case of a voluntary early retirement. Termination benefits which are not 
expressed to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present values.
 
 
3.13 Income Tax Expenses
 
Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and deferred income tax expense. Current and deferred income tax are recognized as income 
or expense and included in profit or loss for the year, except to the extent that the tax arises from (a) a transaction or event which is recognized 
either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and (b) a business combination.
 
Current income tax
 
Current income tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit (loss) for a period. A difference between the taxable 
profit and accounting profit may arise when income or expense is included in accounting profit in one period but is included in taxable profit in 
a different period. Differences may also arise if there is revenue that is exempt from taxation or expenses that is not deductible in determining 
taxable profit (loss). Current income tax liabilities (assets) for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be paid to 
(recovered from) the taxation authorities, using the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the 
reporting period.
 
The Company offsets current income tax assets and current income tax liabilities if, and only if, the Company (a) has a legally enforceable right to 
offset the recognized amounts and (b) intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
 
Deferred income tax
 
Deferred income tax is recognized, using the asset-liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax based amount of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amount in the financial statements. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences 
and deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. However, deferred income tax liabilities are not recognized if they 
arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
 
The carrying amount of a deferred income tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The Company reduces the carrying amount ofKB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018305a deferred income tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or 
all of that deferred income tax asset to be utilized.
 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the period when the asset is realized or 
the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The 
measurement of deferred income tax liabilities and deferred income tax assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in 
which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. 
 
The Company offsets deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities when the Company has a legally enforceable right to offset 
current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities; and the deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities relate 
to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity; or different taxable entities which intend either to settle 
current income tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which 
significant amounts of deferred income tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.
 
Uncertain tax positions
 
Uncertain tax positions arise from a claim for rectification brought by the Company, an appeal for a refund of tax levied by the tax authorities, or 
others due to different interpretation of tax laws or others. The Company recognizes its uncertain tax positions in the separate financial statements 
based on the guidance in Korean IFRS 1012. The income tax asset is recognized if a tax refund is probable for taxes paid and levied by the tax 
authority. However, interest and penalties related to income tax are recognized in accordance with Korean IFRS 1037.3.14 Earnings per Share
 
The Company calculates basic earnings per share amounts and diluted earnings per share amounts for profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity 
holders and presents them in the statement of comprehensive income. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable 
to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating 
diluted earnings per share, the Company adjusts profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders and the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares including convertible bond and share option.3.15 Operating Segments
 
The Company is composed of a single operating segment. Therefore, disclosures on segments are omitted in accordance with Korean IFRS 1108,

The Company assesses expected credit loss on financial asset at amortized cost and financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive 
income other than financial asset at fair value through profit or loss and recognizes loss allowance. Expected credit losses are a probability-
weighted estimate of possible credit losses within certain range by reflecting reasonable and supportable information that is reasonably available 
at the reporting date without undue cost or effort, including information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic 
conditions. For financial assets at amortized cost, the Company measures the expected credit losses and presents it in the financial statements 
netting the allowance from the related loans; for financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the Company 
presents it in the other comprehensive income.

4.3.1 Overview of liquidity risk
 
Liquidity risk is a risk that the Company becomes insolvent due to uncertain liquidity caused by unexpected cash outflows, or a risk of borrowing 
high interest debts or disposal of liquid and other assets at a substantial discount. The Company manages its liquidity risk through analysis of the 
contractual maturity of interest-bearing assets and liabilities. The Company discloses the analysis of remaining contractual maturity of financial 
assets and liabilities by maturity group; such as, on demand, up to one month, between over one month and three months, between over three 
months and 12 months, between over one year and five years, and over five years.
 
Cash flows disclosed for the maturity analysis are undiscounted contractual principal and interest to be received (paid) and; thus, are not identical 
to the amount in the financial statements that are based on the present value of expected cash flows in some cases. The amount of interest to be 
received or paid on floating rate assets and liabilities is measured on the assumption that the current interest rate would be the same through the 
maturity.4.3.2. Liquidity risk management
 
The liquidity risk is managed by liquidity management principles and related guidelines which are applied to the risk management policies and 
procedures that address all the possible risks that arise from the overall business of the Company.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 20183114.3.3. Analysis of remaining contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities

5 years’ category according to their remaining contractual maturity because the assets’ point of sale is uncertain.312 FINANCIAL SECTION4.4 Market Risk
 
4.4.1 Concept
 
Market risk is the risk of possible losses which arise from changes in market factors; such as, interest rate, stock price, foreign exchange rate and 
other market factors that affect the fair value of future cash flows of financial instruments. The most significant risk of the Company is interest rate 
risk.4.4.2 Interest rate risk
 
Definition of interest rate risk
 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of items in the statement of financial position and cash flows relating to interest income and interest 
cost incurred from investing and financing activities change due to interest rate fluctuation.
 
Observation method and management indicator on interest rate risk
 
The main objective of interest rate risk management is to protect asset values against interest rate fluctuations. The Company manages the risk 
through measurement and management of Value at Risk(VaR) for the interest rate.
 
Interest Rate VaR
 
Interest rate VaR is the maximum possible loss due to interest rate risk at a 99.9% confidence level. The measurement results of risk as of 
December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:Interest rate VaR20182017\149,774 \159,530(In millions of Korean won)4.5 Capital Adequacy
                                             
The Company complies with the capital adequacy standard established by the Financial Services Commission. The capital adequacy standard is 
based on Basel III published by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Bank for International Settlements in June 2011, and was implemented 
in Korea in December 2013. The Company is required to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 7.125%(2017: 6.25%), a 
minimum Tier 1 ratio of 8.625%(2017: 7.75%) and a minimum Total Regulatory Capital ratio of 10.625%(2017: 9.75%) as of December 31, 2018.
 
The Company's equity capital is classified into three categories in accordance with the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory 
Regulations on Financial Holding Companies as below:
 
-  Common Equity Tier 1 Capital: Common equity Tier 1 Capital represents the issued capital that takes the first and proportionately greatest share 
of any losses and represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the Company, and not repaid outside of liquidation. It includes common 
shares issued, capital surplus, retained earnings, non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, accumulated other comprehensive income, 
other capital surplus and others.-  Additional Tier 1 Capital: Additional Tier 1 Capital includes (i) perpetual instruments issued by the Company that meet the criteria for inclusion inAdditional Tier 1 capital, and (ii) stock surplus resulting from the issue of instruments included in Additional Tier 1 capital and others.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018313-  Tier 2 Capital: Tier 2 Capital represents the capital that takes the proportionate share of losses in the liquidation of the Company. Tier 2 Capital 
includes a fund raised by issuing subordinated debentures maturing in not less than 5 years that meet the criteria for inclusion in Additional Tier 
2 capital, and the allowance for loan losses which are accumulated for assets classified as normal or precautionary as a result of classification of 
asset soundness in accordance with Regulation on Supervision of Financial Holding Companies and others.Risk weighted asset means the inherent risks in the total assets held by the Company. The Company calculates risk weighted asset by each risk (credit 
risk, market risk, and operational risk) based on the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory Regulations on Financial Holding Companies 
and uses it for BIS ratio calculation.
 
The Company assesses and monitors its adequacy of capital by using the internal assessment and management policy of the capital adequacy.  The 
assessment of the capital adequacy is conducted by comparing available capital (actual amount of available capital) and Internal Capital (amount 
of capital enough to cover all significant risks under target credit rate set by the Company). The Company monitors the soundness of finance and 
provides risk adjusted basis for performance review using the assessment of the capital adequacy.
 
Internal Capital is the amount of capital to prevent the inability of payment due to unexpected loss in the future. The Company measures, allocates 
and monitors Internal Capital by risk type and subsidiaries.
 
The Risk Management Council of the Company determines the Company’s risk appetite and allocates Internal Capital by risk type and 
subsidiary.  Each subsidiary efficiently operates its capital within a range of allocated Internal Capital. The Risk Management Department of the 
Company monitors the limit on Internal Capital and reports the results to management and the Risk Management Council. The Company maintains 
the adequacy of capital through proactive review and approval of the Risk Management Committee when the Internal Capital is expected to 
exceed the limits due to new business or business expansion.
 
Details of the Company’s capital adequacy calculation in line with Basel III, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:Equity Capital:

5,424,524Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability could be settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s 
length transaction.  For each class of financial assets and financial liabilities, the Company discloses the fair value of that class of assets and 
liabilities in a way that permits it to be compared with its carrying amount at the end of each reporting period. The best evidence of fair value of 
financial instruments is quoted price in an active market.KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018315Methods of determining fair value of financial instruments are as follows:Cash and due from financial 
institutionsInvestment securitiesDerivativesLoans at amortized costDebtsDebenturesThe carrying amounts of cash and demand due from financial institutions and payment due from financial 
institutions are a reasonable approximation of fair values. These financial instruments do not have a fixed 
maturity and are receivable on demand.  Fair value of ordinary due from financial institutions is measured using 
DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) model.The fair value of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets is determined using the quotedprices. Fair value is determined through the use of external professional valuation institution where quoted 
prices are not available. The institutions use one or more of the following valuation techniques including DCF 
Model, Free Cash Flow to Equity Model, Imputed Market Value Model, Dividend Discount Model, Risk Adjusted 
Discount Rate Method, and Net Asset Value Method.For exchange traded derivatives, quoted price in an active market is used to determine fair value and for OTCderivatives, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. The Company uses internally developed 
valuation models that are widely used by market participants to determine fair values of plain vanilla 
OTC derivatives including options, interest rate swaps, and currency swaps, based on observable market 
parameters.  However, some complex financial instruments are valued using appropriate models developed 
from generally accepted market valuation models including the Finite Difference Method and the Monte Carlo 
Simulation or valuation results from independent external professional valuation institution.DCF model is used to determine the fair value of loans.  Fair value is determined by discounting the expected cash 
flows, which are contractual cash flows adjusted by the expected prepayment rate, at appropriate discount rate.
Carrying amount of overdraft in foreign currency is regarded as representative of fair value because they do not 
have a fixed maturity and are payable on demand. Fair value of other debts is determined using a DCF model 
discounting contractual future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate.Fair value is determined by using the valuations of external professional valuation institution, which are calculatedusing market inputs.Other financial assets andliabilitiesThe carrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair values. These financial instruments are temporaryaccounts used for other various transactions and their maturities are relatively short or not defined.Fair value hierarchy
 
The Company believes that valuation methods used for measuring the fair values of financial instruments are reasonable and that the fair values 
recognized in the statements of financial position are appropriate. However, the fair values of the financial instruments recognized in the statements 
of financial position may be different if other valuation methods or assumptions are used. Additionally, as there is a variety of valuation techniques 
and assumptions used in measuring fair value, it may be difficult to reasonably compare the fair value with that of other financial institutions.
 
The Company classifies and discloses fair value of the financial instruments into the three-level hierarchy as follows:
 
Level 1: The fair values are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date.
 
Level 2: The fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly or indirectly.
 
Level 3: The fair values are based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety shall be determined on the basis of 
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed316 FINANCIAL SECTIONagainst the fair value measurement in its entirety. If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on 
unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement.
 
Fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statements of financial position
 
The fair value hierarchy of financial assets measured at fair value in the statement of financial position as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, is as

5,424,5241  Because due from financial institutions classified as level 2 are deposits on demand, carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values.  And because due from 
financial institutions classified as level 3 are due from financial institutions with residual maturity of less than 3 months, carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair 
values.
2  Because loans at amortized cost and loans classified as level 3 are loans with residual maturity of less than one year, carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair 
values.
3 For other financial assets and other financial liabilities classified as level 3, carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values.
4 Because debentures classified as level 2 are liabilities with residual maturity of less than one year, carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values.Valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurement
 
Financial assets and liabilities whose carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value are not subject to disclose valuation techniques

Sensitivity analysis of financial instruments is performed to measure favorable and unfavorable changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
which are affected by the unobservable parameters, using a statistical technique. When the fair value is affected by more than two input 
parameters, the amounts represent the most favorable or most unfavorable outcome. There are derivative-linked securities whose fair value 
changes are recognized in profit or loss.320 FINANCIAL SECTIONThe results of the sensitivity analysis from changes in inputs are as follows:Financial assetsFinancial assets at fair value through

Net Defined Benefit Liabilities
 
Defined benefit plan
 
The Company operates defined benefit plans which have the following characteristics:
 
- The Company has the obligation to pay the agreed benefits to all its current and former employees.
- Actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more than expected) and investment risk fall, in substance, on the Company.
 
The net defined benefit liability recognized in the statements of financial position is calculated in accordance with actuarial valuation methods using 
market data; such as, interest rates, future salary increase rate and mortality rate based on historical data. Actuarial assumptions may differ from 
actual results, due to changes in the market, economic trends and mortality trends.
 
Changes in the defined benefit obligation for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:Present value of definedbenefit obligationFair value of planassetsNet defined benefitliabilities2018(In millions of Korean won)Beginning

Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all 
dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Company’s dilutive potential ordinary shares include stock grants.
 
A calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average market share price 
of the Company’s outstanding shares for the period) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the stock grants. The 
number of shares calculated above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of stock grants.

The issuance of the Company’s separate financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, was initially approved on February 8, 
2019 and re-approved due to revision on March 8, 2019 by the Board of Directors.350 FINANCIAL SECTIONReport on Independent Auditor'sReview of Internal Control over Financial ReportingTo the President of KB Financial Group Inc.We have reviewed the accompanying management's report on the effectiveness of the Internal Control over Financial Reporting (“ICFR”) of KB 
Financial Group Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018. The Company's management is responsible for designing and operating ICFR and 
for its assessment of the effectiveness of ICFR. Our responsibility is to review the management's report on the effectiveness of the ICFR and issue 
a report based on our review. The management's report on the effectiveness of the ICFR of the Company states that “Based on the assessment 
results, Chief Executive Officer and ICFR Officer believe that the Company's ICFR, as at December 31, 2018, is designed and operating effectively, in 
all material respects, in conformity with the ICFR Design and Operating Conceptual Framework”
 
Our review was conducted in accordance with the ICFR review standards established by the Korean Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those 
standards require that we plan and perform, in all material respects, the review of management's report on the effectiveness of the ICFR to obtain a 
lower level of assurance than an audit. A review is to obtain an understanding of a company's ICFR and consists principally of inquiries of management 
and, when deemed necessary, a limited inspection of underlying documents, which is substantially less in scope than an audit. 
 
A  company's  ICFR  is  a  system  to  monitor  and  operate  those  policies  and  procedures  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the Republic of Korea. Because of its inherent limitations, ICFR may not prevent or detect a material misstatement of 
the financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that management's report on the effectiveness of the ICFR, referred 
to above, is not presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the ICFR Evaluation and Reporting Best Practice Guideline.
 
Our review is based on the Company's ICFR as of December 31, 2018, and we did not review management's assessment of its ICFR subsequent 
to December 31, 2018. This report has been prepared pursuant to the Acts on External Audit for Stock Companies, etc. in Korea and may not be 
appropriate for other purposes or for other users.Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers
March 12, 2019KB Financial Group  Annual Report 2018351Report on the Effectiveness ofthe Internal Control over Financial ReportingTo the Shareholders, Board of Directors and Audit Committee of
KB Financial Group Inc.We, as the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Internal Control over Financial Reporting(“ICFR”) Officer of KB Financial Group Inc. (“the Company”), 
assessed the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's Internal Control over Financial Reporting for the year ended December 
31, 2018. 
 
The Company's management, including ourselves, is responsible for designing and operating ICFR. We assessed the design and operating effectiveness 
of the ICFR in the prevention and detection of an error or fraud which may cause material misstatements in the preparation and disclosure of reliable 
financial statements. 
 
For the purpose of design and operation of ICFR, we have used ‘ICFR Design and Operation Conceptual Framework' as criteria which is established 
by the Operating Committee of Internal Control over Financial Reporting in Korea (the “ICFR Committee”). We also followed the ‘ICFR Evaluation and 
Reporting Best Practice Guideline' which is also established by the ICFR Committee to evaluate the effectiveness of the ICFR design and operation.
 
Based on the assessment results, we believe that the Company's ICFR, as at December 31, 2018, is designed and operating effectively, in all material 
respects, in conformity with the ‘ICFR Design and Operation Conceptual Framework'. 
 
We certify that this report does not contain any untrue statement of a fact, or omit to state a fact necessary to be presented herein. We also certify 
that this report does not contain or present any statement which cause material misunderstandings, and we have reviewed and verified this report 
with sufficient due care.February 28, 2019Jong Kyoo Yoon,
