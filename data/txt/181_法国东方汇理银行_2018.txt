the financial statements for the fourth quarter and full year 2018.In  fourth quarter 2018,  stated  net income  reached  1,008 million euros,  up  sharply  (x2.6)  compared  tofourth quarter 2017  (387 million euros),  which  notably  saw  the  effects  of  the  Finance Act  in France, namely  acorporate  tax  surcharge  (-256 million euros,  net  of  the  refund  of  the  dividend  tax)  and  a  revaluation  of 
deferred taxes  to  take  account  of  the  expected  decrease  in  corporate  income  tax  rate  in  France  and  in  the 
United States (-128 million euros).There  are  few  specific  items  for  the  quarter,  which  had  a  limited  negative  effect  of  -59 million euros  on 
net income. These primarily involve a fine imposed by the Italian competition authority (AGCM) on FCA Bank8, 
with an impact on the Group this quarter of -67 million euros, which factors in the previous provisions booked to 
settle a dispute; the other specific items are far smaller amounts and partially offset each other (see the detail on 
p. 16). In the fourth quarter of 2017, specific items were much more substantial, particularly due to the effectsof  the  measures  planned  under  the  2018  Finance  Act  in  France  referred  to  above:  these  had  an  impact  on 
net income of -490 million euros, of which -403 million euros related to tax adjustments. Also of note during thequarter  was  the  recognition  of  negative  goodwill  linked  to  the  consolidation  of  the  three  Italian  banks,  in  theamount  of  +312 million euros  (+408 million euros  before  non-controlling  interests)  which  was  offset  by  the 
impairment of all goodwill on the Polish entities in the amount of -222 million euros. Other specific items recordedfor the quarter include the integration costs of Pioneer and the three Italian banks (total impact of -54 million euroson  net income),  the  penalty  associated  with  the  Cheque  Image  Exchange  (-58 million euros)  and  specific 
recurring accounting items9 comprising the rest for -65 million euros.7   See calculation of ROTE p. 26; annualised rate calculated without restating IFRIC21 charges, taking into account AT1 coupons deducted directlyfrom Group net equity; RONE of the divisions and business lines calculated using the same method8   See press release published on 9 January 2019

capital markets,  and 
for  Capital markets  &for  Asset  and  Wealth management  andin  particularinvestment banking.  These  are  the  only  business  lines  that  saw  their  contribution  decline  compared  to 
fourth quarter 2017.  The  other  business  lines  more  than  offset  this  under-performance,  thanks  to  excellent 
underlying revenues,  very  positive  jaws effects  in  most  of  the  business  lines  less  sensitive  to  the  marketenvironment  and  the  decline  of  the  cost  of  credit  risk  in  all  financing  business  lines.  The  Largecustomers division benefited from net provision write-backs as it did in the previous two quarters. It should be 
noted that the Group decided to recognise a non-specific legal provision of 75 million euros in fourth quarter 2018booked in the corporate centre. The strong pick-up in growth between income before tax and net income group 
share, in both stated and underlying figures, is attributable to a sharp decrease in tax expense in stated figuresowing mostly to the non-recurring tax surcharge which had affected the fourth quarter of 2017 and was classifiedas a specific item, and in underlying figure thanks to a higher share of the revenue generated in countries otherthan France with a lower tax rate and to the different effects of tax consolidation recognised in the fourth quarter 
but relating to the whole of the 2018 fiscal year.Due to their negligible impact on net income, the scope and foreign exchange effects are not provided in detail 
this quarter. However, it should be noted that the acquisition of the three Italian banks, which were consolidatedonly  in  late December 2017,  produced  a  scope  effect  on  revenue,  expenses  and  provisions  which  could  not, 
however, be calculated after the merger of the legal entities in the third quarter of 2018.An analysis of the fourth quarter 2018 income statement is provided below.Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results3/28Standing  at  4,814 million euros,  underlying  revenues  were  stable  (+0.1%)  thanks  to  the  good  resistance  ofbusiness  lines  vulnerable  to  the  unfavourable  market  environment  and  the  growth  of  other  business  lines,  in 
particular Insurance (+6.0%), Retail banking in Italy (+17.5%, primarily related to the effect of the integration ofthe three banks), other international retail banking (+7.2%), Leasing & factoring (+7.8%) and Consumer finance(+1.7%).  Asset  Management  and  Capital  Markets  and  Investment  Banking  were  the  two  business  lines  most 
affected by the market environment. Amundi saw a decline in revenue of -18.2%/-134 million euros compared tothe  fourth quarter of 2017,  due  mainly  to  the  sharp  drop  in  performance  fees  (-75.1%/-61 million euros)  andfinancial income (change of -50 million euros), with asset management fees also declining, albeit more modestly, 
by  -2.9%.  Capital Markets and Investment Banking,  operating  mostly  on  the  bond  markets,  in  advisory  and  inequity origination, saw a decline of -29,3% in its revenues on the back of contracting credit volumes (bond issues 
in euros10 falling -12%), more satisfactory on foreign exchange and swaps, and a squeeze on customer margins. 
Also  of  particular  note  is  the  very  negative  impact  of  FVA  (Fair Value Adjustment).  In  contrast,  the  Largecustomers division’s  Financing  activities  saw  virtually  no  change  in  their  revenues  (-0.7%)  despite  thehigh comparison base in fourth quarter 2017, with the last quarter of 2018 closing out an excellent year for these 
activities (revenue up +7.6% compared to 2017) as well as for Commercial Banking and Structured Finance. LCLsaw a slight drop in its revenues compared to fourth quarter 2017 of -0.6%/-5 million euros, virtually unchangedexcluding renegotiation and early repayment fees, but including impairments of some equity interests, excluding 
which revenues would have been up.Notable activity developments among the business lines in the fourth quarter include:-a further upward trend in the lending activity of Retail banking in the Group’s domestic markets,with  continuing  growth  in  loans  to  businesses  for  LCL  compared  to  31 December 2017  (+11%)  and 
home loans:  +6.6%  for  LCL  and  +10%  for  CA Italia;  note  that  this  last  figure  is  like-for-like  since  theoutstandings  of  the  three Italian banks  acquired  in  late 2017  had  already  been  consolidated  at31 December 2017; since their integration, these banks have been recording sharp sequential increases 
in  their  loan  origination;  the  number  of  new home loans  granted  was  up  +29%  in  the  fourth quarter 
compared to the third quarter and doubled compared to the first quarter;-the net inflows of the Asset Gathering & Insurance division were uneven for the quarter: although theRetirement & Savings segment of the Insurance business line recorded strong net inflows, up comparedto the previous quarters, at +2.1 billion euros, including +1.3 billion euros/62% in unit-linked policies (69% 
over the full year 2018), Wealth Management was more modest at +0.6 billion euros and, significantly,Asset Management recorded net outflows of  -6.5 billion euros, due primarily to institutional customers,while Retail reported positive net inflows of +0.5 billion euros ; this net outflow was due to a particularly 
adverse environment in all markets this quarter, reflected in a market effect in assets under managementof -43.7 billion euros in the last three months of the year, completely erasing the effects of the excellentnet inflows 
including 
+36.3 billion euros in medium-long term assets; the Insurance business also continued its very strongthroughout  2018,  namely  +42.0 billion euros,reported  by  Amundigrowth (+7.9%) in Property & casualty policies, with total policies outstanding having increased +5.4% 
year-on-year, for net growth of 700,000 policies;-the  excellent  growth  reported  by  Specialised Financial Services:  Consumer finance  surpassedincluding 
+10 billion euros 
+11.2 billion euros  in  the  fourth quarter.  As  a  result,  managed outstandings  rose  +7.2%  compared  toin  origination  of  managed outstandingsin  every  quarter  of  2018,end-December 2017,to  88.5 billion euros,  driven  by  automotive partnerships(+11.2%)  andGroup networks. Consolidated gross financial leasing outstandings were up +3.1% for the same period, 
to 14.6 billion euros, driven in particular by a +10% increase internationally; factored turnover grew by 
+4.1% year-on-year in fourth quarter 2018;-a high level of activity in CIB/Financing activities, with a sharp increase in Commercial banking drivenby activity on all product lines and a sustained level of activity in Structured Finance in line with previousquarters;  it  should  be  noted  again  this  quarter  that  this  good  performance  did  not  translate  into  an 
increase  in  risk-weighted  assets,  which  have  decreased  compared  to  end-September,  excluding  one10 All international investment grade issues in € - worldwide - bookrunner (Source: Refinitiv 31/12/2018)Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results4/28regulatory  change11,  thanks  to  good  syndication  activity  and  risk  transfer:  applying  its  Distribute  to 
Originate model; Financing recorded an average primary syndication rate of 39% in the last 12 months, 
stable versus 2017 and up +13 percentage points compared to 2013, the year in which it ramped up this 
policy.Of note since the last quarterly publication is the  extension of the partnership between Agos and Banco BPM,giving  Agos  access  to  the  distribution  of  consumer  credit  within  the  Banca Popolare di Milano network,  whichmerged with Banco Popolare to create Banco BPM, the third largest bank in the country. A distribution agreement 
with the  entire Banco BPM network for a period  of 15  years is expected  to be signed  when  this agreement is 
finalised before 30 September 2019.Details of the other highlights are provided in the section of this press release on Crédit Agricole Group.Stable revenues in a less favourable environment in the fourth quarter are combined with tight control of costs, 
which registered an underlying increase of only +0.8% compared to fourth quarter 2017. Note that this increaseof +25 million euros between the two periods is more than accounted for by the Corporate Centre, whose costsrose by +68 million euros between the two periods given the investments in payment and information systems, 
additional costs that were mostly charged back as Corporate Centre revenue to other business lines. Underlyingoperating  expenses  of  the  Group’s  business  lines  were  down  -1.5%  despite  the  scope effect  of  thethree Italian banks  and  the  provisions  for  “Macron grants”  (15 million euros  in  all  for  the  Crédit Agricole S.A. 
group). All the business lines played a role in the decrease except for Retail Banking due to CA Italia, which bore 
the brunt of the scope effect of the three banks.The fall in underlying gross operating income was therefore limited to -1.2% compared to fourth quarter 2017. 
The underlying cost/income ratio stood at 65.9%.The  cost  of  risk  declined  sharply,  down  -26.6%  compared  to  fourth quarter 2017  to  a  very  low  level(246 million euros  versus  335 million euros  in  fourth quarter 2017).  This  decline  came  almost  entirely  frombusinesses exposed to credit risk (only LCL and Leasing & Factoring were up slightly, by +8 million euros and 
+2 million euros,  respectively).  Retail banking in Italy  continued  on  a  downward 
trend  (-14.0%)  andCIB/Financing is again in a situation of net provision write-back in Buckets 1 and 2 (IFRS9) while provisions forspecific risks  are  at  a  very  low  level.  This  reflects  a  further  improvement  in  credit risk  indicators  (NPL ratio, 
coverage ratio)  in  all  the  vulnerable  businesses.  Crédit Agricole S.A.  group’s  cost  of  risk  relative  to 
outstandings12 fell -6 basis points compared to fourth quarter 2017, to 23 basis points. It remains stable quarter-
on-quarter  for  LCL  (17 basis points)  and  Consumer finance  (118 basis points),  but  continued  its  decline  for 
Retail banking in Italy  (CA Italia,  67 basis points).  Crédit Agricole S.A.  group’s  NPL  ratio  is  down  -0.4  point  at 
2.8% compared to end December 2017 and the coverage ratio is up +7.0 points at 74.3%.It was decided this quarter to recognise a non-specific provision for legal risk in the Corporate Centre in the 
amount of 75 million euros.The  underlying  contribution  of  equity-accounted  entities  rose  by  +7.2%  to  74 million euros  and  reflects  thesharp  increase  in  profitability  of  automotive partnerships  in  Consumer finance  and  the  Asset management 
joint ventures in Asia.Net income from asset disposals  reached  56 million euros  this  quarter  compared  to  just  16 million euros  infourth quarter 2017, mainly at LCL: +47 million euros from the disposal of two operating buildings.Underlying pre-tax income13 before discontinued operations and non-controlling interests increased by 
+2.8% to 1,450 million euros. By contrast, income tax charge fell sharply by -42.9%, notably as a result of theadjustment of annual tax rates in the last quarter of the year and a stronger than expected increase in revenues 
in countries with lower taxes than those in France. Underlying net income before non-controlling intereststherefore  rose  +22.9%.  Non-controlling  interests  increased  by  +31.9%  or  +39 million euros,  mainlyattributable to Corporate Centre in connection with the effect in 2017 of a newly consolidated subsidiary (Fireca)with  an  accumulation  of  losses,  offset  in  part  by  the  buy-back  of  non-controlling interests  in  CACEIS  last11 See the comments on solvency on p. 19.

1,067 million euros.Stated net income for full-year 2018 amounted to 4,400 million euros, compared to 3,649 million euros in 2017,an increase of +20.6%.Specific  items  in  full-year  2018  had  a  negative  impact  of  just  -5 million euros  on  stated net income.  Thefourth quarter items already mentioned above more than cancelled out the impact of those in the first nine monthsof 2018, namely a positive impact of +54 million euros, including the adjustment of negative goodwill recognisedat the time of acquisition of the three Italian banks totalling +66 million euros, -14 million euros for the costs of 
integrating Pioneer  (-30 million euros before tax and non-controlling interests) and recurring volatile accounting 
items  for  +3 million euros  (+2 million euros  before  tax).  Specific items  for  full-year  2017  had  an  impact  of  -€276 million euros  on  net income.  In  contrast  to  the  aforementioned  numerous  negative  specific  items  in  the 
fourth quarter of 2017,  the  specific  items  for  the  first nine months of 2017  had  an  impact  on  net income  of+214 million euros.  These  comprised  the  share  of  the  liability management  operations  for  +26 million euros(+39 million euros  before tax),  the  impact  of  the  disposal  of  BSF  for  +114 million euros  and  of  Eurazeo  for 
+107 million euros, 
-69 million eurosrecurring  volatile  accountingitems,  namelyissuer spreadfor(-121 million euros before tax), DVA for -39 million euros (-61 million euros before tax), loan portfolio hedges inthe Large customers division for -34 million euros (-53 million euros before tax) and provisions for home purchase 
savings plans for +166 million euros (+256 million euros before tax). The detail for the two periods can be found 
on p. 16 of this press release.Since 1 January 2018 and the transition to IFRS9, the impact of issuer spread on the fair value of liabilities hasbeen recognised directly under equity, without any impact on prudential capital. This effect in Group share terms 
amounts to +193 million euros for fourth quarter 2018 and +397 million euros for full-year 2018.Excludingthese  specificitems,  underlying net incomerose  by  +12.2%  versusfull-year 2017to4,405 million euros,  beating  the  target  set  out  in  the  Strategic Ambition 2020  Medium-Term Plan 
(4.2 billion euros), which it has reached one year ahead of schedule.Underlying earnings per share came to 1.39 euros, an increase of +13.8% compared with full-year 2017.Crédit Agricole S.A.’s  Board of Directors  will  make  a  proposal 
the  General Shareholder's Meeting  of 
21 May 2019 for the payment of an all-cash dividend per share of 0.69 euro, which is higher than the minimumtolevel of 0.60 euro per share set in the third quarter of 2016 and +9.5% higher that the dividend paid for 2017. The 
dividend pay-out ratio stands at 50% of both stated earnings per share and underlying earnings per share.Underlying  ROTE14  (return  on  tangible  equity)  reached  12.7%  in  full-year  2018,  a  significant  increase  of 
+1.6 percentage point compared to 2017, thanks to improvements in most business lines.14 See details on the calculation of the ROTE (return on tangible equity) and business lines' RONE (return on normalised equity) on p. 26. ROTE iscalculated by taking underlying net income for the first half of the year, including IFRIC21 costs and AT1 coupons, which are normally charged to

of risk.Underlying  revenues  increased  by  +4.9%  compared  to  2017.  The  Large  Customers  division  suffered  in  thefourth quarter due to a more adverse market environment; the decline was primarily concentrated  this quarterand in Capital markets and investment banking, where underlying revenues fell by -16.1%/-378 million euros infull year 2018  compared  to  2017.  At  -0.4%  or  -13 million euros,  LCL’s  underlying  revenues  were  virtually 
unchanged due to negative impacts in equity revaluations in the fourth quarter. All other Group businesses sawincreases  in  their  revenues,  which  in  some  cases  was  very  significant:  Asset  management  +11.1%,  WealthManagement  +7.5%,  Retail  banking  in  Italy  +13.4%  (these  three  businesses  benefited  from  a  scope  effect), 
Insurance +9.3%, Leasing and factoring +5.7%, CIB/Financing +7.6%.Underlying operating expenses increased by +3.8%, excluding the contribution to the Single Resolution Fund(SRF),  which  increased by  a significant  +24.5%  to 301 million euros  in 2018  versus  242 million euros  in 2017(mostly  in  the  first  half  of  both  periods).  Thanks  to  the  positive  jaws  effect  of  +1.1 percentage point,  the 
underlying cost/income ratio excluding the SRF improved by 0.7 percentage point to 62.1%.The cost of credit risk, excluding non-specific legal provisions, fell -23.4%/-306 million euros compared to2017. This drop is primarily due to the Large customers division (impact of +267 million euros before tax between 
the  two  periods),  net  write-backs for  the  business  line  in 2018  (+64 million euros)  compared  to net  provisions(-203 million euros) in 2017, especially for Financing (impact of +285 million euros). The contribution changes ofthe  other  activities  more  or  less  cancelled  each  other  out:  slight  increase  for  Specialised Financial Services 
(+6.1%/+27 million euros)  and  LCL  (+7.5%/+15 million euros),  but  a  decrease  for  International Retail Banking 
(-16.7%/-72 million euros), both in Italy and in the other regions.It should be noted that the group decided to recognise a non-specific legal provision of 75 million euros in 2018 
(in the fourth quarter) versus 115 million euros in 2017.The  -38.3%/-200 million euros  decrease  in  underlying  net  income  from  equity-accounted  entities  can  beexplained  by  the  deconsolidation  of  BSF  and  to  a  lesser  extent  of  Eurazeo,in  the  amountof  -249 million euros.  After  restatement  for  this  item,  growth  was  recorded  in  the  Asset management  and 
Consumer finance  joint  ventures.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  equity-accounted  entities  contributed  just  7%  tounderlying net income compared with 13% in 2017 (and almost one third in 2015). The increase in the share offully  consolidated  income  was  a  significant  step  in  simplifying  Crédit Agricole S.A.  and  in  improving  its  cash 
control, enabling better coverage of dividends.Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results7/28Underlying pre-tax income increased by +10.9%, to 6,500 million euros. Tax charge increased by +2.7% dueto stronger than expected growth in pre-tax income in countries with lower tax rates. Net income increased by 
+13.0%,  while  the  stronger  increase  in  non-controlling  interests  (+18.9%),  notably  attributable  to  the  sharpincrease in Amundi's contribution after the integration of Pioneer, brought growth in underlying net income to 
+12.2%, at 4,405 million euros.Stripping out the substantial increase in the SRF, net income rose +12.8%.Infourth quarter 2018,  Crédit Agricole S.A.’s  solvencyremained  very  solid,  with  afully-loadedCommon Equity Tier 1(CET1)15to

This  effect  virtually  offset  the  quarter’s  capital  generation  (+14 basis points),  after  theratio  of  11.5%  at  31 December 2018,  stable  comparedthe  adverse  effect  ofdeduction  of  coupons  on  additional Tier 1 securities  accrued  during  the  quarter  and  the  factoring  in  of  thedividend  of  0.69 euros per share  to  be  proposed  to  the  upcoming  General Shareholders’ Meeting  on  21 May. 
At 307 billion euros,  the  stability  of  risk-weighted  assets  this  quarter  conceals  unfavourable  regulatorychanges of +4 billion euros/-15 basis points, linked to the initial effects of the targeted review of internal models(TRIM) by the single supervisor for 1 billion euros/-3 basis points and the early introduction of Basel 4 regarding 
non-financial  operational  risks17  (compulsory  standard  method),  for  3 billion euros/-12 basis points.  Excluding 
these two regulatory impacts, risk-weighted assets linked to business decreased. Turning to market risk, VaR18 
remained virtually stable this quarter at an average of 5.1 million euros versus an average of 4.9 million euros in 
the third quarter of 2018.The phased-in leverage ratio19 was 4.0% at end-December 2018 as defined in the Delegated Act adopted by 
the European Commission. The intra-quarter leverage ratio amounted to 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018.Crédit Agricole S.A.’s  average  LCR  ratio  over  twelve  months  stood  at  133.3%20  at  end-December  2018,  i.e. 
higher than the Medium-Term Plan target of over 110%.For  2018  as  a  whole,  Crédit Agricole S.A.  issued  14.1 billion euros  in  medium-term  debt  instruments,  i.e.2.1 billion euros more than the annual financing plan (118%). It raised the equivalent of 7.3 billion euros in seniorpreferred debt (uncollateralised) and collateralised senior debt and  the equivalent of 6.8 billion euros in Tier 2 
and senior non-preferred debt, the latter amounting to 5.2 billion euros.***Philippe Brassac, Chief Executive Officer, commented on the fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 results and activity 
of Crédit Agricole S.A. as follows: “In 2018, Crédit Agricole S.A.’s business lines surpassed the main objectives 
of the Medium-Term Plan one year ahead of schedule. This is proof of the strength of its universal banking model,which  is  the  foundation of  a strong,  sustainable relationship. The Group  is  well  equipped  to  handle the risinguncertainty, which was witnessed in the fourth quarter with a much more unfavourable market backdrop. This 
strength and the progress made together with the Regional Banks on the Group’s customer project are assets 
for the next Medium-Term Plan, which will be unveiled on 6 June at Crédit Agricole S.A.’s Evergreen Campus.”15   Including full year 2018 retained earnings.

This increase constitutes a step inthe implementation of the finalisation of Basel 3 (Basel 4), which in the future will authorise only the standard method.18 Value at risk, calculated over one day with a confidence interval of 99%

13 July 2018.20 LCR Ratio (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) on a 12 months average ; numerator and denominator of the ratio respectively amounted to 174.1 billion eurosand 130.6 billion euros for Crédit Agricole S.A.Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results8/28Crédit Agricole GroupCredit Agricole Group’s stated net income for 2018 totalled 6.8 billion euros, up +4.7% compared to 2017.Adjusted  for  specific  items,  in  particular  the  exceptional  tax  surcharge  in  France  in  2017,stated net income  was  still  6.8 billion euros,  down  -3.8%.  The  excellent  level  of  customer  acquisition 
throughout  the  year,  especially  for  Retail  Banking  in  France  and  in  Italy  (1.8 million  in  new  businessrelationships)  and  continued  cross-selling  efforts  have  offset  the  negative  effects  of  prolonged  lowinterest  rates,  weak  economic  growth  in  Europe  and  an  unfavourable  market  environment  in  the 
fourth quarter, to deliver underlying revenue growth. Growth investments and especially the increase inthe contribution to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) and the cost of risk compared to a low comparisonbase in 2017 account for the slight decrease in pre-tax income and underlying net income (-3.8%). The 
Regional Banks confirm the stabilisation of their revenues but their net income suffered from the effectsof the market environment on their portfolio revenue and a virtual tripling of their cost of risk comparedto the write-backs of collective provisions in 2017. The same trends were seen throughout the quarter 
for the Group and Regional Banks, intensified by more difficult underlying revenue generation due to themarket environment. Financial solidity further appreciated in the fourth quarter with an improvement inthe  fully-loaded CET1 ratio  of  +0.1  percentage  point  to  15.0%,  550 basis points  above  the  regulator’s 
requirements21.In line with the "Strategic Ambition 2020" Medium-Term Plan (MTP), the Group’s stable, diversified and profitablebusiness model drove organic growth in all its business lines, largely through synergies between the specialised 
business lines and the retail networks, and ensured a high level of operating efficiency while generating leeway 
to invest in development.For the whole of 2018, the following highlights must be taken into account:-the  integration  of  the  three Italian banks  acquired  at  the  end  of  2017  –  CR Rimini,  CR Cesena,CR San Miniato  –  was  completed  with  the  merger  of  each  of  the  legal  entities  with  CA Italia  and  themigration of their IT systems; cost optimisation and cross-selling efforts have begun to have a positiveimpact and the year-on-year increase in revenue of the new entity now surpasses that of the costs in the 
fourth quarter, while the falling cost of risk is confirmed;-  The  first  full  year  of  the  integration  of  Pioneer following  its  acquisition  by  Amundi  on  3 July 2017 
generated 110 million euros in cost synergies, i.e. 63% of the revised target of 175 million euros by2020 and most of the integration costs, i.e. 192 million euros, were recognised in 2017 and 2018; thisintegration  allowed  Amundi  to  better  withstand  the  unfavourable  market  environment  in  the 
fourth quarter;-  CA Assurances  (CAA)  delivered  on  its  new  strategy  to  expand  its  distribution  network  to  its 
international partners outside the Crédit Agricole Group by signing two international bancassurancepartnership  agreements:  the  first  with  Credito Valtellinese  (“Creval”,  1 million customers)  in  Italy,achieved by the acquisition by CAA of 100% in Creval’s insurance brokerage firm, an exclusive 15-year 
distribution  agreement  for  the  savings  and  death  &  disability  products  of  CA Vita,  a  wholly-ownedsubsidiary of CAA, and the purchase of a 5% stake in the capital of Creval; second, the strengthening ofits property & casualty insurance partnership with the Portuguese bank Novo Banco in order to increase 
its stake in the jointly-owned subsidiary GNB Seguros from 50% to 75% by acquiring the 25% stake heldby the Portuguese insurance company Seguradoras Unidas;-  CA  Consumer  Finance  (CACF)  announced  a  partnership  with  the  Spanish  banking  group,  Bankia(8.1 million customers), to form a joint venture in Spain which will expand CACF's European presenceand  provide  Bankia's  customers  with  personal finance  products  designed  by  CACF;  again,  in  theConsumer finance  business  line,  Agos  also  renewed  and  extended  its  partnership  with  Banco  BPM,

environment for its activities;-the results of the EBA (European Banking Authority) stress tests published on 2 November show a 
solid Group financial position and solid business lines, with Crédit Agricole Group’s CET1 ratio at 10.2%even  in  an  adverse  scenario,  remaining  well  above  the  required  SREP  level  of  9.5%  without  everhitting the distribution restriction level;-  Concerning the litigation matter with OFAC, the US authorities (United States Attorney's Office for theDistrict  of  Columbia  and  District  Attorney  of  the County  of  New  York)  decided  on  19 October 2018  to 
cease  the  pursuit  of  criminal  sanctions  which  had  been  deferred  for  three  years  in  line  with  thedeferred  prosecution  agreement  signed  between  CACIB  and  said  authorities  in  October 2015;  the 
authorities  acknowledged  that  CACIB  has  fulfilled  all  the  obligations  required  of  it  under  such 
agreements,  which  have  now  expired;  the  US  authorities  thus  acknowledged  the  improvements  incompliance implemented by CACIB, which remains fully committed to strengthening its procedures and 
internal controls to ensure compliance with international economic sanctions;In 2018, stated net income increased +4.7% to 6,844 million euros. The comparison base of stated net incomein 2017 was impacted by some very substantial specific items amounting to -587 million euros in net income, ofwhich  -671 million  linked  to  heavy  non-recurring  tax  expenses  in  the  fourth quarter of 2017,  -83 million  in 
integration costs for Pioneer and the three Italian banks, -123 million in liability management costs of the Groupand the Regional Banks, -98 million in Cheque Image Exchange fines, -153 million in changes in issuer spreadand, offsetting this, +131 million in changes in goodwill (negative goodwill of the three Italian banks net of the 
impairment  of  goodwill  in  Poland)  and +205 million in capital  gains  on  the  disposal  of  BSF  and Eurazeo.  Theother items almost entirely offset each other. For 2018 as a whole, specific items were offset, resulting in a net 
impact on net income of only -5 million euros (see the detail of specific items for all periods on p. 17).Excluding these specific items, underlying net income for 2018 was down -3.8% compared to 2017, and -2.4%excluding  the  very  sharp  rise  in  the  SRF  (+36.2%  to  389 million euros).  It  should  be  noted  that  while  acalculation  on  a  like-for-like  basis  is  no  longer  possible  after  the  merger  of  the  legal  entities  of  thethree Italian banks, the scope effect on growth over the full year is negative: the sales and de-consolidations ofBSF  and  Eurazéo  led  to  a  loss  in  contribution  to  net income  of  +203 million euros,  while  the  contribution  of 
Pioneer to be reintegrated (consolidated only in the second half of 2017) had a positive impact on year-on-yeargrowth  of  just  +75 million euros,  and  the  three  Italian  banks  and  Banca Leonardo,  in  their  first  year  of 
consolidation, are not yet making a significant positive contribution.Underlying revenues increased by +1.5%, underlying operating expenses excluding the SRF rose +2.7%,and  the  cost  of  credit  risk  (excluding  non-specific  legal  provisions  of  115 million euros  in  2017  and 
75 million euros  in  2018  allocated  to  the  fourth  quarter)  rose  +6.8%.  Underlying  income  before  tax  wastherefore  down  slightly  by  -3.3%  to  10,123 million euros  while  underlying  net  income  fell  -3.8%  to6,849 million euros.Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results10/28Crédit Agricole Group – stated and underlying results, 2018 and 2017€mRevenuesOperating expenses excl.SRFSRFGross operating incomeCost of riskCost of legal riskEquity-accounted entitiesNet income on other assetsChange in value of goodwillIncome before taxTax

They include the costs of integrating Pioneer Investments into Amundi and the three Italian banksinto  CA Italia,  which  came  to  -21 million euros  (-38 million euros  before  tax  and  non-controlling  interests),  a 
further  provision  of  -67 million euros  to  cover  a  fine  imposed  by  the  Italian  competition  authority  (in

Infourth quarter 2017,  specificitems  had  a  negativeimpact  of  -770 million euros  on  net income,  ofwhich -671 million euros related to very substantial non-recurring tax expense, -57 million euros in costs relatingto  the  integration  of  Pioneer  and  the  three Italian banks,  -98 million euros  in  Cheque  Image  Exchangefines, -62 million euros in variations of issuer spread and +131 million euros in changes in goodwill (the negative

While the scope of Crédit Agricole S.A. is stable (see above), the decline posted forthe  Group  as  a  whole  is  attributable  to  the  unfavourable  effect  of  the  market  environment  on  the  investment 
portfolios  of  the  Regional Banks.  By  contrast,  their  customer business revenues  rose  +2.2%,  confirming  the 
turning point identified in the third quarter of 2018.Underlying  operating  expenses  excluding  the  contribution  to  the  SRF  saw  a  modest  increase  of  +1.8%compared to fourth quarter 2017, owing mainly to the change in the scope of consolidation of Crédit Agricole S.A.with the integration of the three Italian banks, and, with respect to the Regional Banks, to growth investments 
and “Macron grants”23 (45 million euros, i.e. a total of 60 million euros for the whole Crédit Agricole Group). The 
underlying  cost/income  ratio  stood  at  67.5%.  Underlying  gross  operating  income  decreased  by  -9.3%compared to fourth quarter 2017.The  cost  of  credit  risk  rose  sharply  by  +18.0%  to  499 million euros  versus  423 million euros  infourth quarter 2017.  This  rise  is  solely  attributable  to  the  Regional Banks,  which  had  recorded  write-backs  of 
collective provisions in the third quarter of 2017 ahead of the transition to IFRS 9. However, at 14 basis points, 
the cost of risk relative to outstandings is very low for the Regional Banks. Crédit Agricole Group’s cost of credit 
risk relative to outstandings remained low, at 18 basis points24, stable compared to fourth quarter 2017 and 
third quarter 2018. Crédit Agricole Group’s NPL ratio is down -0.3 point at 2.4% compared to end December 2017 
and the coverage ratio is up +4.8 points at 84.8%.It should be noted that the group decided to recognise a non-specific legal provision of 75 million euros in 2018 
(in the fourth quarter) versus 115 million euros in 2017.Net  income  from  asset  disposals  reached  48 million euros  this  quarter  compared  to  just  8 million euros  infourth quarter 2017, mainly at LCL: +47 million euros from the disposal of two operating facilities.Adding  the  contribution  from  equity-accounted  entities,  which  increased  by  +13.1%/+9 million euros  to 
77 million euros, and despite the positive contribution from these three last items, underlying pre-tax income 
fell by -14.6% compared to fourth quarter 2017, to 2,175 million euros.The drop in underlying tax charge (-41.4%) and the absence of contribution from discontinued operations (which 
was  negative  in  fourth quarter 2017)  moderated  the  downward  trend  of  underlying  net  income,  which 
declined -3.9% to 1,626 million euros.23   Extraordinary bonuses decided by the government that can be paid, subject to a fiscal cap, to employees of French companies and are exemptfrom tax and social security contributions for both the employee and the employer.24 Average cost of credit risk over the last four rolling quarters, annualisedFourth quarter and full year 2018 results12/28The Regional Banks continue to pursue the universal customer-focused banking model. Customer savings,standing at 692 billion euros, rose +2.7% year on year. This growth was driven by the solid growth in on-balancesheet deposits:  outstandings of 434 billion  euros  at the  end of December 2018, +5.0% year-on-year. Growth 
continued to be driven by demand deposits (+8.6% year-on-year) and Livret A deposit accounts (+9.9%).  Off-balance sheet deposits (258 billion euros) fell by just -1.0%, attributable to a difficult market environment in thefourth  quarter  which

under management +6.1% compared to December 2017).Loans  outstanding  rose  by  +6.7%  versus  31 December 2017  to  487  billion euros.  The  growth  of  loansoutstanding was underpinned by all credit categories: home loans (+7.8% versus 31 December 2017), loans to 
businesses (+10.4%) and consumer credit (+8.5%).These improvements are associated with winning new customers, i.e. more than 1.3 million net new customers 
relationship since the beginning of the year, including BforBank. The launch of EKO in December 2017, anentry-level banking offer common across all Regional Banks, made it possible to attract new prospects (70% ofthe relationship input)  and nearly 80,000 customers have opened an  account since its launch, i.e. 8%  of new 
accounts opened over the period, in line with the customer segment specifically targeted by the offer: 37% of thenew relationships were formed online.This commercial performance made a significant contribution to growth in Crédit Agricole S.A.'s business lines, 
which  distribute  a  large  number  of  products  as  the  Group’s  main  distribution  network  and  the  leading 
Retail Banking network in France.For full-year 2018, the contribution to Crédit Agricole Group’s underlying net income from the Regional bankscame to 2,403 million euros, a decrease of -21.9% compared to 2017. This drop is due to the fall in underlyingrevenues  of  -1.9%,  primarily  attributable  to  the  lesser  performance  of  investment  portfolio  income  of  the 
Regional banks and the low interest rate environment; their underlying revenues saw a more moderate declineof -0.9% compared to 2017. Operating expenses excl. SRF, climbed to +2.0% from +1.5%, mainly as the resultof  the  “Macron grants”  (45 million euros).  This  increase  is  attributable  to  growth  investments.  The  underlying 
cost/income  ratio  excluding  SRF  came  out  at  66.3%  for  the  period.  Lastly,  the  cost  of  risk  nearly  tripledyear-on-year,  i.e.  +416 million euros,  reflecting  substantial  write-backs  of  collective  provisions  in  2017  inanticipation  of  the  transition  to  IFRS9.  The  cost of risk  relative  to  outstandings  remains  at  a  very  low  level, 
reflecting a stable non-performing loan ratio of 2% relative ot total gross customer loans and a coverage ratio of100%. Underlying income before tax declined by -19.2% to 3,688 million euros and underlying net income group 
share declined by -21.9%.In  fourth quarter 2018,  the  Regional Banks'  contribution  to  underlying  net income  was  537 million euros,down  -29.7%  compared  to  fourth  quarter 2017.  This  fall  is  attributable  to  the  adverse  market  conditions  thatimpacted underlying revenues, which fell -4.0% compared to fourth quarter 2017. However, customer businessrevenues rose +2.2%; the same base effect was seen on the cost of risk as the one for the whole year (substantial 
write-backs of collective provisions in 2017 linked to the transition to IFRS 9).The  performance of  the  other  Crédit Agricole Group business  lines  is  described  in detail  in the  section of  this 
press release on Crédit Agricole S.A.Over  the  quarter,  Crédit Agricole Group  further  improved  its  financial  solidity,  with  a  fully-loaded  common 
equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio25 of 15.0%, up by +0.1 percentage point compared to end-September 2018. This 
ratio  provides  a  substantial  buffer  of  550  basis  points  above  the  SREP/P2R  threshold  applicable  to 
Crédit Agricole Group as of 1 January 2019, set at 9.5% by the ECB.25   Including first-half 2018 retained earnings.Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results13/28The TLAC ratio was 21.4% at 31 December 2018, excluding eligible senior preferred debt, up slightly fromend-September 2018 (21.2%) and up compared to end-December 2017 (20.6%). This ratio is 190 basis points 
above  the  minimum  requirement  excluding  the  countercyclical buffer  for  2019  of  19.5%,  without  taking  intoaccount senior preferred debt that is eligible at 2.5% of risk-weighted assets based on the regulatory calculation.The  TLAC ratio target  of  22%  by  2019,  excluding  eligible  senior  preferred  debt,  has  been  confirmed,  with  a 
CET1 ratio target of  15.5%  to 16%  and  6%  to 6.5%  for  senior non-preferred debt, Tier 2 and additional Tier 1 
instruments. The Group issued the equivalent of 6.8 billion euros in Tier 2 and senior non-preferred debtin 2018.The  MRELratio  wascirca12.4%at31 December 2018,of  which8.4%excludingeligible senior preferred debt. Crédit Agricole Group was notified on 8 June 2018 of the immediately applicableminimum  required  level  including  eligible  senior  preferred  debt.  Crédit Agricole Group  complied  with  this 
minimum level at 31 December 2018.The phased-in leverage ratio26 came to 5.4%, stable compared to end-September 2018.Crédit Agricole Group’s 
is  solid.  The  Group’s  banking  cash  balance  sheet,  at 
1 238 billion euros  at  31 December 2018,  shows  a  surplus  of  stable  funding  resources  over  long-termliquidity  positionapplications of funds of more than of 100 billion euros, which is the Medium-Term Plan target. The surplusof  stable  funds  finances  the  HQLA  (High Quality Liquid Assets)  securities  portfolio  generated  by  the  LCR 
(Liquidity Coverage Ratio)  requirement  for  customers  and  customer-related  activities.  These  securities(109 billion euros)  cover  short-term  debt  net  from  central  banks  deposits  more  than  three  times  over.  The 
liquidity reserves, which include capital gains and discounts on securities portfolios, stood at 272 billion eurosat 31 December 2018.Crédit Agricole Group issuers raised the equivalent of 34.1 billion euros of medium- and long-term debt in2018,  versus  just  over  36.1 billion euros  for  the  whole  of  2017.  Moreover,  Crédit Agricole Group  placedin  bonds  with4.4 billion euros 
its  retail banking networks  (the  Regional banks,  LCL  and  CA Italia). 
Crédit Agricole S.A. raised a total of 14.1 billion euros in 2018, representing 41% of the total issuance of all the 
Group's issuers, thus exceeding its issuance programme for 2018 by 2.1 billion euros.***Dominique Lefebvre, Chairman of SAS Rue La Boétie and Chairman of Crédit Agricole S.A.'s Board of Directors, 
commented on the Group's 2018 results and activity as follows:“In 2018, Crédit Agricole Group continued to serve its clients, providing solutions to all on a day-to-day basis, in 
a spirit of inclusion and customer focus. With a growing number of new customers across all regions of operation,the group has shown that its range of products and services is in line with customer needs. In the face of a highlyuncertain environment, the group demonstrated unwavering financial strength and high-quality results, which are 
the  rewards  of  a  strategy  that  has  proven  its  relevance.  This  profitability  and  strength  afford  the  group  theopportunity to support  all stakeholders. We are the leading  provider of financing for the French economy, thenumber one provider of personal protection insurance in France and the largest asset manager in Europe. We 
support  the  economy,  entrepreneurship  and  innovation,  working  closely  with  people,  their  projects  and  theregions where they work. We aim to promote inclusive finance through tailored, affordable solutions and services, 
and are committed to supporting the energy transition.”26   The leverage ratio amounts to 5.6% subject to the issue by the ECB of an authorisation to exempt exposures linked to the centralisation of deposits 
with the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations to take account of Judgement T-758/16 of the General Court of the European Union of 13 July 2018.Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results14/28Corporate socialand environmentalresponsibilityCrédit Agricole S.A. confirms its position as the leading arranger of green bondsAccording to the Dealogic ranking, Crédit Agricole CIB confirmed its position as the world’s leading bookrunnerfor  green,  social  and  sustainable  bonds.  In  China,  the  bank  has  participated  in  80%  of  issues  of  Chinesegreen bonds worldwide since January 2017. With a market share of 6.9% in 2018, Crédit Agricole CIB, committed 
for years to green financing, was once again recognised as the world leader. In 2019, CACIB will contribute tostrengthening the growing trend of these instruments in combating climate change.In addition, Crédit Agricole complemented its global leadership in green bonds in late 2018, with an initial issueof  1 billion euros  to  finance  its  energy  transition  commitments.  This  Crédit Agricole  S.A.  issue,  structured  by 
Crédit Agricole CIB,  created  a  framework  to  allow  the  refinancing  of  projects  supporting  climate  protectionprovided by all the entities of the Group who signed throughout France and its territories and worldwide.Energy transitionFive  years  after  the  creation  of  FEIH  (Futures  Energies  Investissements  Holding),  held  50/50  by  Engie  andCrédit Agricole Assurances tripled its original portfolio and reached 1.5 GW in solar and wind capacity in France.CAA is reinforcing its position in energy transition infrastructure, a sector in which it is the leading institutional

Crédit Agricole Group comprises this quarterly financial report, and the attached presentation and press 
release, available at https://www.credit-agricole.com/finance/finance/publications-financieres.This report may include prospective information on the Group, supplied as information on trends. This data doesnot represent forecasts within the meaning of European Regulation 809/2004 of 29 April 2004 (chapter 1, article 
2, §10).This  information  was  developed  from  scenarios  based  on  a  number  of  economic  assumptions  for  a  givencompetitive and regulatory environment. Therefore, these assumptions are by nature subject to random factors 
that could cause actual results to differ from projections.Likewise,  the  financial  statements  are  based  on  estimates,  particularly  in  calculating  market  value  and  asset 
impairment.Readers must take all these risk factors and uncertainties into consideration before making their own judgement.Applicable standards and comparabilityThe figures presented for  the six-month period ending 30 June 2018 have been prepared in accordance withIFRS as adopted in the European Union and applicable at that date, and with prudential regulations currently in 
force. This financial information does not constitute a set of financial statements for an interim period as defined 
by IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” and has not been audited.Note:  The  scopes  of  consolidation  of  the  Crédit Agricole S.A.  and  Crédit Agricole  groups  have  not  changedmaterially since the registration with the AMF, the French market watchdog, of the 2017 Registration Document 
including all regulatory information about Crédit Agricole Group.The sum of values contained in the tables and analyses may differ slightly from the total reported due to rounding.The income statements contained in this report show non-controlling interests with a minus sign such that theline item "net income" is the mathematical addition of the line item "net income" and the line item "non-controlling 
interests".On  1  January  2017,  Calit  was  transferred  from  Specialised Financial Services  (Crédit Agricole  Leasing  & 
Factoring) to Retail Banking in Italy. Historical data have not been restated on a proforma basis.Since  3  July  2017,  Pioneer  has  been  included  in  the  scope  of  consolidation  of  Crédit Agricole  Group  as  a

disposal). This subsidiary was consolidated using the equity method. Historical data have not been restated on 
a proforma basis.Since 21 December 2017, Cassa di Risparmio (CR) di Cesena, CR di Rimini and CR di San Miniato have beenincluded in the scope of consolidation of Crédit Agricole Group as subsidiaries of Crédit Agricole Italy. Historical
