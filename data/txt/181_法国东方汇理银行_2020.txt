Chief Executive Officer of Crédit Agricole S.A.“Thanks to our solid results, we are committed to support the economy as a whole over 
the long term.”2/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Crédit Agricole GroupThe Group is fully committed to supporting its customers 
through the crisisGroup commitment through the crisisThanks to its capital position and resilient model, since the beginning of the public health crisis, the Group hasbeen fully committed to supporting its customers through the crisis and to fostering societal transitions.Since the introduction of State-Guaranteed Loans (SGLs) on 25 March 2020, the Group has processed over 
211,000 applications from SMEs and small businesses and corporates, for a total of €31.5 billion3, i.e. close to 
27%  of  all  SGLs  requested  in  France.  With  an  acceptance  rate  exceeding  97%,  the  Group  thus  supports  its 
customers in all its regions through its various networks (three quarters for Regional banks4). In Italy, CA Italia 
also granted €2.4 billion in SGLs to 40,000 customers. SGL outstandings within the Group rose slightly in the 
fourth quarter in France (+6.6% compared to 16 October 2020 for the SGLs), but more noticeably in Italy (+32.7%compared to end September 2020).At  the  same  time,  the  Group  continues  to  support  the  economy  by  implementing  loan  repayment  moratoria,notably for corporate, SME and small business customers, whose activities have been impacted by the economicconsequences  of  the  COVID-19  public  health  crisis.  After  a  high  of  552,000  payment  holidays  granted,  for€4.2 billion in maturities extended in June 2020, as at 15 January 2021, a total of 95,300 payment holidays were 
still active at the Regional Banks and LCL, representing €0.7 billion in deferred maturities (of which 70% for SMEand small business and corporate customers and 30% for households, and 87% at the Regional Banks and 13% 
at LCL5). This corresponds to total of remaining capital of €10.7 billion, of which €5.1 billion due from corporates, 
SMEs and small businesses and farmers.A return to normal is thus gradually taking shape and several indicators point to certain risks steadily decreasing.Accordingly, the number of loans with a deferred maturity has very significantly decreased in the final quarter of 
2020  (-45%  since  end  September  and  -83%  compared  to  end  June  2020).  Furthermore,  in  the  specialisedmarkets (corporate customers, SMEs and small businesses and farmers), in the Regional Banks, more than 98%of deferred maturities that expired at 31 December 2020 resumed payments, reflecting the Group’s prudent policy 
in matters of risk management. At Crédit Agricole Consumer Finance, payments have resumed on 98% of expiredpayment holidays. Lastly, CACIB reported a return of drawdowns on liquidity facilities to pre-crisis levels (19% inDecember 2020, at the same level as in February 2020, but after a 32% peak recorded in March and April 2020) 
and regulatory VaR at 31 December 2020 was back to a low of €9.2 million, versus €22.2 million at 31 March2020.Along with these actions, the Group mobilised more than €300 million in the form of solidarity donations for its 
most  vulnerable  customers.  Thus,  in  April  2020,  the  Group  provided  an  extra-contractual  mutualist  stimulus 
(geste  mutualiste)  in  the  amount  of  €239 million  to  multi-risk  business  insurance  policyholders  with  businessinterruption  cover.  Moreover,  the  various  Group  entities  provided  nearly  €70 million  in  solidarity  donations.Accordingly,-  Crédit Agricole Assurances paid €39 million into the solidarity fund set up for the very small businessesand independent workers in particularly hard hit sectors;-  Crédit Agricole in Italy made a €2 million donation to the Italian Red Cross and to hospitals;-  Crédit du Maroc contributed €8 million to the national COVID-19 solidarity fund3 Amounts of SGLs requested (RBs, LCL and CACIB) at 15/01/2021, 97.3% acceptance rate

5 In deferred maturities.3/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020-  Collectively, the Crédit Agricole  Group contributed €20 million to the financing of the protection of theelderly.Despite the return to normal gradually taking shape, the Group continued its actions intended for its customersin greatest difficulty, by setting up targeted facilities. For individual customers, insurance coverage is preservedeven in the event of late payment; for SMEs and small businesses, electronic payment subscriptions (payment 
terminal fees) are reimbursed for customers whose shops are closed; for the aerospace sector, the Group is theonly bank with a €100 million contribution to the Ace investment fund dedicated to mid-caps and SMEs in thesector. Lastly, the Group extended by one year the first year of the SGL in accordance with public regulations.The crisis confirms the relevance of the Group Project and the 
differentiating nature of the global relationship model.-  Firstly, as part of the Customer Pillar of its Group Project, presented in June 2019, the Group ramped upthe digitisation of its offerings in the interests of customer satisfaction. Thus, the utilisation rate of Groupapps (active profile on the apps or connection on the website in the last month) sharply increased, posting 
a rise in both banks of the Regional Banks and LCL (respectively +3.3 percentage points compared toend-2019 to 68.2% and by +7.1 percentage points to 53.4%). Likewise, the Group rolled out new digitaltools  intended  for  its  customers  to  make  their  activities  easier  during  lockdown,  such  as  the  Up2Pay 
Range  (enabling  remote  payment  through  a  digital  loyalty  program)  and  Click  &  Collect  to  supportretailers in the new methods of consumption. Innovative non-banking services were also set up for youngpeople and small businesses (Youzful, Blank, Agilauto).-  This translated into a sharp improvement in the Group's positioning in terms of customer satisfaction: the 
Group is thus the only bank among the 25 brands which have proven their utility during the lockdown6, 
while the Net Promoter Score (NPS) was up in 2020 compared to 2019, both in the Regional Banks and 
at  LCL  (+7  points,  to  respectively  +8  and  +27)  and  at  CA  Italia  (+8 points  compared  to  2019),  which 
became this year the second Italian bank in terms of customer satisfaction.-  This  success  was  made  possible  as  a  result  of  the  full  commitment  of  Group  employees  and  to 
strengthened local customer relations. The sharp increase in the participation rate of employees in theERI  (Engagement  and  Recommendation  Index)  survey  to  80%  (+3  points  compared  to  2019  and+21 points compared to 2016) illustrates this well. In addition, the Group launched innovative initiatives 
in  managerial  transformation,  supported  by  organisational  transformation,  to  ramp  up  our  employeeempowering process, aimed at creating more value for customers.The Group supports societal transitions, and is more than ever committed 
for regions and for climate.Green finance and SRIAs part of the human and societal pillars of the Group Project, the Group supports the societal transitions that itscustomers  have  requested  and  are  experiencing.  Accordingly,  thanks  to  its  leading  position  in  SRI  matters,through its various entities, the Group is able to offer its customers all the green and social solutions that theymay need.Accordingly, 100% of the funds opened by Amundi present a SRI score that is higher than their benchmark; atyear-end  2020,  Amundi  exceeded  its  target  for  “green  solutions”  funds,  which  increased  from  €12.3  billion  to 
€21.9  billion  at  year-end  2020.  (2022  target:  €20bn).  In  addition,  Amundi  has  been  selected  to  manage  aeurozone  equity  index  fund aligned  with  the  Paris  Agreement  on  climate  change,  on behalf  of  12  institutional6 Study Brand Asset Valuator, October 2020,all sectors, only one bank in the top.

Crédit Agricole Assurances and Amundi launched “Energies Vertes”, the first energy transition fund eligible forlife-insurance policies.CACIB  saw  its  green  loan  outstandings  increase  from  €7.1  billion  to  €11.7  billion  in  one  year  (2022  targets: 
€13bn). CACIB also ranks second worldwide in terms of green, social and sustainable bonds ($28 billion arrangedin 2020). This year, the Federal Republic of Germany has entrusted the emission of its first green bond, for €6.5billion, to the Crédit Agricole Group. It represents approximately 10% of the volume of sovereign green bonds 
outstanding and will be used to finance Germany’s climate and environmental strategy. CACIB took part in thishistoric transaction as associate bookrunner and also acted as exclusive adviser for Germany in the structuringof its Green Bonds program published in August 2020.Meanwhile LCL rolled out a green investment range, LCL Impact Climat.Finally, the Group reached its medium term objective in terms of green social or sustainable outstandings in theliquidity portfolio, with €9.3 bn outstandings end 2020.These  efforts  were  rewarded.  The  Group  received  two  positive  assessments  from  agencies  in  2020:  theinternational climate reference agency, the Carbon disclosure project (CDP) raised the Group’s rating from C toA-, and the annual evaluation of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) led to Amundi being awarded amaximum rating of A+ for its SRI strategy and management.As it committed to do under the Medium-Term Plan as launched in June of 2019, the Group has set up a globalgovernance to drive its extra-financial performance. It is supported by a scientific committee of high-level experts. 
A SRI steering platform was developed in 2020. Unique in its kind, it enables the collection of external and internalextra-financial data in order to calculate the main societal impact indices for all Group entities. Based on publicdata, it generates a unique climate transition rating for listed companies. Amundi and Crédit Agricole CIB have 
been using this rating as a commercial tool for dialogue since 2020. In 2021, the transition rating will be expandedto include unlisted companies.To  monitor  the  extra-financial  performance  of  unlisted  companies,  the  Group  also  set  up  a  standard  SRIquestionnaire that is currently being rolled out at LCL, the Regional Banks and in some international entities.5/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Inclusive financeThe Group also demonstrated its inclusive commitment by supporting regions and the young. For example, in 
2020, the Group recruited 18,000 new employees8, 30% of whom are under 30 years of age, as well as 4,700 
work-study  students  (i.e.+50%  in  two  years).  The  Group  also  posted  a  sharp  increase  in  its  attractiveness  in 
higher education institutions for the last three years (ranked 47th out 130 (+23)) in business schools and 85th out 
of 130 (+17)  in engineering schools9. Thus, the Group ranked 1st place in financial services  in France among 
Diversity Leaders, the FT’s European ranking (ranking 133rd out of 70010).The Group also supports the solidarity economy through several initiatives: the Amundi Solidarité fund recorded€331 million at end 2020 and this year, Amundi launched CPR invest social impact, the first global equity fund toplace  reducing  inequalities  at  the  center  of  its  investment  process;  lastly,  Crédit Agricole Assurances  created 
“Contrat solidaire”, the first Finansol-certified social multi-vehicle life insurance policy. Crédit Agricole S.A. alsocompleted its first social bond issue, for local, sustainable and inclusive growth in the regions. For the amount of€1  billion and subscribed 2.5 times, this bond is  designed to finance businesses  in areas  with unemployment 
rates that exceed the national average, digital tools for the regions, development of the health sector, and theimproving social cohesion.The Group strengthens its universal customer-focused banking model, 
open to multi-business partnershipsThe  Group  strengthened  its  universal  customer  focused  banking  model  through  the  rollout  of  several  internal 
projects. Thus, LCL sold to Crédit Agricole Assurances a home loan book for €445 million, making it possible tooptimise the refinancing of LCL and to diversify the investment portfolio of Crédit Agricole Assurances; CACIBand CA Indosuez Wealth Management in turn created a joint team to assist high net worth customers and family 
holding companies. Finally, a Group level multi-business Group division was created for mid-cap corporates, andwill  be  managed  by  CACIB.  In  the  area  of  IT  expenses,  for  the  full  year  2020  the  Group  allocated  to  the 
technological  transformation  €8 billion11,  of  which  38%  in investments  notably  for  datacentricity  or  information 
system overhaul.The  rollout  of  synergies  within  Crédit Agricole  Group  is  also  reflected  in  the  continued  improvement  in  the 
equipment of retail banking customers with property and casualty insurance products12: 41.7% of Regional Bank 
customers  (+1.0 point  year-on-year),  25.5%  of  LCL  customers  (+0.5 point)  and  17.1%  of  Crédit Agricole Italiacustomers (+1.7 point) have a property and casualty insurance policy with the Group.The Group continued to open its universal customer-focused banking model in Europe through multi-businessline partnerships in Europe and in Asia.In Europe, Amundi, number one asset manager in Europe, finalised in January the Sabadell AM acquisition andentered into  a strategic  partnership  with Banca Sabadell;  in October,  Crédit Agricole  Assurances  finalised  the

Its 
impact  on  the economy  has  been  more limited  compared  to  the first  lockdown  in  the second  quarter.Accordingly,  the  volume  of  payments  at  merchants,  recorded  by  the  Regional  Banks  and  LCL  duringNovember,  represented  1.5  times  the  volumes  recorded  in  April.  In  the  fourth  quarter,  the  Group’s 
business  lines  showed  strong  momentum  despite  this  new  lockdown,  and  in  2020,  business  wasgenerally good, thanks to rebounds after each lockdown.Thus, Crédit Agricole Assurances reported a strong rebound in activities in the fourth quarter 2020 (+19% 
in fourth quarter compared to third quarter) with very strong UL inflows levels (+26.9% in fourth quarter2020 compared to fourth quarter 2019 and +24.3% compared to third quarter 2020).

Similarly CACF recorded a net rebound in production at 
the end of the second lockdown, with production for the month of December up +16.8% compared to thatof  the  month  of  November.  In  CIB,  CACIB  strengthened  its  leading  syndicated  loan  and  bond  issue 
positions (world’s 2nd largest arranger of green, social and sustainable bonds), in a context of normalizing 
markets.Gross  customer  capture  remained  strong  over  the  full  year;  the  Group  recorded  +1,500,000  newcustomers between 2019 and 2020, with over +1,000,000 for the Regional Banks, +300,000 for LCL and 
close  to  +120,000  for  CA  Italia.  Against  this  backdrop,  the  customer  base  continued  to  rise  markedlyduring the year (+148,000 net additional customers in 2020).Overall, the levels of activity of the Group’s business lines demonstrated good resilience over the full 
year: accordingly, the overall home loan production in the Regional Banks and LCL for full year 2020 was96%  of  the  full  year  2019  level;  the  volume  of  new  business  in  property  and  casualty  insurancerepresented 91% of the 2019 volume, while consumer finance production in 2020 represented 86% of the2019 volume.7/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Group results

The  Asset  gathering  and  Largecustomers  business  lines  posted  respectively  increases  of  +2.1%  (+€35 million)  and  +1.0%  (+€14 million)  in 
revenues; likewise for Retail banking in France, the Regional Banks posted an increase of +0.3%, i.e. +€12 millionand LCL an  increase of +4.5%, i.e.  +€39 million. Specialised Financial Services  have proven resilient, indeedwhile the underlying revenues decreases by -3.8%, excluding CACF NL the decrease in revenues remains limited 
-1.1%  (-€7  million)  despite  a  strong  sensitivity  of  this  activity  to  the  economic  environment.  The  InternationalRetail Banking, in turn, posted, a decline of -2.8% (-€19 million), due to the drop in interest rates in Egypt, Polandand Ukraine.Underlying operating expenses excluding SRF (Single Resolution Fund) were stable (+0.0%) compared tofourth quarter 2019 at €5,567 million. The Asset gathering and International retail banking business lines posteda  drop  in  expenses  for  respectively  -1.5%  (-€11 million)  and  -1.6%  (-€8 million).  Expenses  decreased  in 
Specialised financial services by -3.8% (-€12 million), including the reclassification of CA Consumer Finance NLunder IFRS 5 to activity held-for-sale. On a like-for-like basis, expenses increase by +4.0% in relation with thedevelopment of Specialised financial services in France and in Europe. Expenses rose marginally over the period 
for French Retail banking: +1.2% (+€36 million), and in the Large customers business line: +2.0% (+€18 million).Overall, the Group posted a positive +0.7 percentage points jaws effect. The contribution to the Single Resolution9/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Fund  was  nil  this  quarter,  as  in  fourth  quarter  2019.  The  underlying  cost/income  ratio  stood  at  64.3%,  animprovement of +0.4 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.Underlying gross operating income was therefore up +1.9% to €3,093 million compared to fourth quarter 2019.Cost of credit risk was up, albeit under control (x1.9 compared to fourth quarter 2019, with 93% of the increaseattributable to performing loan provisioning in the context of the COVID-19 crisis for all business lines. It stood at 
€919 million (including €651 million in level 1 and 2 cost of risk and €334 million in level 3 cost of risk) versus€596 million in third quarter 2020, and €494 million in fourth quarter 2019. Asset quality remains good: the non-performing loan ratio was down to 2.4% at end December 2020 (-0.2 percentage point compared to third quarter 
2020)  and  the  coverage  ratio14,  up  to  84.0%,  further  strengthened  this  quarter  (+3.6  percentage  points).  The 
diversified  loan  book  is  mainly  geared  towards  home  loans  (47%  of  gross  outstandings  at  Group  level)  andcorporates  (32%  of  gross  outstandings  at  Group  level).  Loan  loss  reserves  amounted  to  €19.6 billion  at  end 
September  2020,  of  which  34%  was  for  performing  loans  (Stages  1  and  2).  Loan  loss  reserves  were  down  -€0.4 billion compared to September 2020 following the disposal of non-performing loans recorded by CA Italia.Starting  in  first  quarter  2020,  the  context  and  uncertainties  related  to  the  global  economic  conditions  were 
gradually taken into account and the expected effect of public measures were incorporated to anticipate futurerisks.  Provisioning  levels  were  established  to  reflect  the  sharp  deterioration  in  the  environment,  taking  into 
account  several  weighted  economic  scenarios  and  applying  flat-rate  adjustments  for  the  retail  bankingportfolios and corporates portfolios and specific additions for some target sectors, namely tourism, automotive,aerospace,  retail  textile,  and  energy.  Several  weighted  economic  scenarios  were  used  to  determine  theprovisioning of  performing  loans,  of  which a more favourable scenario (GDP  at  +7.1%  in France  in 2021  and 
+2.7% in 2022) and a less favourable scenario (GDP at +3.0% in France in 2021 and +4.8% in 2022). Thesescenarios  have  been  revised  since  second  quarter  2020.  As  a  reminder,  they  previously  included  a  morefavourable scenario with GDP at +7.3% in France in 2021 and +1.8% in 2022 and a less favourable scenario withGDP at +6.6% in France in 2021 and +8.0% in 2022.Annualised  cost  of  risk/outstandings15  over  the  twelve  months  of 2020  was  38  basis  points 
(37 basis points  on  a  quarterly  annualised  basis).  Cost  of  risk  for  Stages  1  and  2  amounted  to  -€651 million, 
versus a reversal of -€87 million in fourth quarter 2019 and -€170 million in third quarter 2020. Stage 3 cost ofrisk stood at -€334 million (versus -€602 million in fourth quarter 2019 and -€428 million in third quarter 2020).Underlying pre-tax income stood at €2,223 million, a  year-on-year decrease of -16.0% from fourth quarter2019. In addition to the changes explained above, underlying pre-tax income also included the contribution fromequity-accounted entities in the amount of €74 million (down -11.1% notably due to CA Consumer Finance) andnet income on other assets, which stood at -€26 million this quarter versus +€21 million in fourth quarter 2019, 
related to declassified IT projects. The underlying tax charge was up +21.4% over the period. The underlyingtax rate rose, due to a base effect (it had reached 20.5% in fourth quarter 2019, and currently stands at 29.7%.However, the effective tax rate is as usual not very representative on a quarterly basis, and the full year is more 
relevant,  so  at  end  2020  it  stood  at  26.6%  (versus  28.7%  at  end  2019).  Underlying  net income  before  non-controlling interests  was  down  -25.0%.  Non-controlling  interests  rose  by  +21.7%,  notably  due  to  a  change  inInsurance in the recognition methods used for subordinated debt (RT1) coupons, without impact on net earnings 
per  share,  and  following  CACEIS’s  acquisitions  of  2020.  Lastly,  underlying  net income Group share  was€1,429 million, down compared to fourth quarter 2019 (-28.1%).Over full year 2020, underlying net income Group share declined by -14.8% compared to 2019. Underlyingrevenues were stable (+0.7%), while underlying operating expenses excluding SRF were down -0.9%, resultingin a positive jaws effect of +1.7 percentage points. Underlying gross operating income totalled €12,304 million, 
up +2.6% compared to 2019.

For Regional banks, the crisis led to an acceleration and a strengthening of the transformation of their distribution 
model, with a particular focus placed on the quality of the customer relationship, confirmed by the 8 percentagepoints improvement of the NPS (Net Promoter Score) over the full year. The customer base over the full year,with 1.1 million new customers, continued to grow and the actual attrition rate (excluding deaths) was down to 
2.9% for the full year. Accordingly, note that the number of active demand deposits was up +0.7% year-on-year,an increase exceeding France’s population growth rate over the same period. The Group is also continuing todevelop its multi-channel model and recorded a +3.8-percentage point increase year-on-year in the number of 
digital customers, taking it to 68.2%,16 as well as a +45% increase in online signatures year-on-year.Commercial activity at the Regional Banks continued to be buoyant this quarter, with growth in outstandingsremaining strong. Loans outstanding amounted to €563.7 billion (€547.1 billion excluding SGLs), up +8.4% 
from December 2019 (+5.2% excluding SGLs). There was a strong increase in home loans (+6.6%) and loansto  corporates,  SMEs  and  small  businesses,  and  farmers  (+12.6%,  +3.3%  excl.  SGLs).  The  increase  inspecialised market loans excluding SGLs was particularly marked by corporate equipment loans being up +8.5% 
over the full year. Loan production was up compared to fourth quarter 2019 (+7.4%; +2.6% excl. SGLs). The 
decrease in new specialised markets17 excl. SGLs (-8%) and in consumer finance was offset by the home loan 
momentum  (+11%).  On-balance  sheet  deposits  stood  at  €517.9 billion,  representing  an  increase  from 
December 2019 of +12.3% (of which +25.3% for demand deposits and +11.8% for passbooks), while off-balancesheet deposits were unchanged (+0.4% to €272.4 billion) with life insurance outstandings up slightly (+0.5%; ofwhich  +6.3%  unit-linked  outstandings)  and  outstandings  linked  to securities  and  transferable securities  stable(+0.2%) in line with the recovery in the markets during the quarter.In fourth quarter 2020, underlying revenues of the Regional Banks amounted to €3,373 million, down -1.2% 
from  fourth  quarter  2019.  Favourable  refinancing  conditions  led  to  an  increase  in  the  net  interest  margin(+4.0%), while the overall level of fee and commission income was down in line with the lower penalty-basedfees. Operating expenses were under control and slightly up over the period (+1.5% compared to fourth quarter2019) related to the adjustment over the period of the employee profit-sharing and incentive plans,  with other 
external services remaining down. Thus, underlying gross operating income was down in fourth quarter 2020(-6.6%).  Underlying  cost  of  risk  stood  at  -€415 million,  sharply  up  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2019  (x2.7).Provisions were primarily for performing loans and the non-performing loan ratio was down to 1.7% (versus 1.8%at end December 2019). Loan loss reserves were slightly up to €10.0 billion. This translated into a high coverage 
ratio,  at  100.9%.  The  Regional Banks’  contribution  to  underlying  net  income  Group  share  thus  stood  at€470 million, down -30.8%.In full year 2020, underlying revenues were down -1.4% compared to full year 2019. Operating expenses weredown -1.1% despite the increase in SRF in the first half of the year (+42.6%). GOI was down -2.1% (-1.3% excl. 
SRF). The underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF remained unchanged at 65.8%. Lastly, with underlyingcost of risk up (x2.1) to €1.0 billion over the full year, the Regional Banks’ contribution to the Group’s underlyingnet income Group share was down -14.1% to €2,230 million.The  performance of  the  other  Crédit Agricole Group business  lines  is  described  in detail  in the  section of  this

This  decline  was  due  to  the  increased  cost  of  risk,  which  stood  at  -€500 million in fourth quarter 2020 (x1.5 compared to fourth quarter 2019). Of that rise, 77% was due to increasedprovisioning  for  performing  loans,  primarily  related  to  prudent  provisioning  in  sensitive  sectors  (such  asaerospace, hotels, tourism, restaurants and certain professionals). Thus, the Asset gathering business line was 
helped by market recovery and the good management of the funds thus generating performance fees and postedgross operating income of +6.2%, the business line’s result posted a drop of  -12.0% from fourth quarter 2019due notably to a change in the recognition methods used for subordinated debt (RT1) coupons, without impact 
on net earnings per share. The Retail banking business line generated a +3.4% increase in its gross operatingincome, driven by strong growth in revenues, particularly at LCL (+4.5% from fourth quarter 2019) and by provenoperational efficiency (underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF of retail banks in fourth quarter 2020 of 66.0% 
(an  improvement  by  +0.7  percentage  point  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2019).  Consequently,  with  a  1.5-foldincrease in cost of risk compared to fourth quarter 2019, the Retail banking net income Group share posted adecline of -13.9% compared to fourth quarter 2019. Specialised financial services recorded a drop of -1.8% in 
gross operating income and of -5.5% on a like-for like basis20 with a good general resistance of sales revenues 
(-2.8% and -1.1% on a like-for-like basis20) and of costs related to the development in France and in Europe (-
3.8% and +4.0% on a like-for-like basis20). Lastly, the Large customers business line, despite stable underlying 
gross operating income (-0.4%) this quarter, was impacted by the 2.0-fold increase in the cost of risk, resultingin a -17.0% decline in net income Group share.In fourth quarter 2020, underlying revenues stood at €5,299 million, up +2.2% compared to fourth quarter 2019.The revenues of the Asset gathering business line were helped by market recovery and by Amundi’s excellentmanagement  performance  and  posted  a  +2.7%  increase  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2019.  Retail  bankingrevenues (+1.2%) were driven by LCL’s net interest margin increase due to the good refinancing conditions, even 
though international retail banking was still hit by the drop in  different markets. Sales revenues of Specialised 
financial  services  showed  good  resistance (-1.1%20  compared  to fourth quarter  2019),  and  the post-lockdown20 Excl. CA Consumer Finance NL16/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020rebound helped to limit the Q4/Q4 drop in production  to -3%. Lastly,  within the Large customer business line,financing  activities  recorded  good  performance  (+3.9%  in  revenues  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2019),  while 
market  activities  suffered  a  base  effect,  in  the  context  of  activities  returning  to  normal  (-5.0%  in  revenuescompared  to  fourth  quarter  2019).  Lastly,  Asset  servicing  revenues  were  up  +8.1%  thanks  to  a  scope  effectrelated to the latest acquisition of Santander Securities Services in 2020.Underlying  operating  expenses  were  down  -1.1%  between  fourth  quarter  2019  and  fourth  quarter  2020,resulting  in indicators  that  showed  very  good levels  of  operational  efficiency:  the  underlying  cost/income ratiowas 60.5% in fourth quarter 2020, an improvement of +2.0 percentage points compared to fourth quarter 2019, 
while the jaws effect was positive at 3.3 percentage points. Within the Asset gathering business line, Insurancesaw  a  sharp  decline  in  expenses  (-7.5%  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2019),  offsetting  the  increase  in  assetmanagement  expenses  (+3.0%),  primarily  related  to  a  scope  effect  –  the  expenses  of  the  Asset  gathering 
business  line,  on  a  like-for-like  basis21  were  down  -0.9%  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2019.  Retail  banking 
confirmed its operational efficiency with a 66.0% underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF, up +0.7 percentagepoints compared to fourth quarter 2019, thanks to stable expenses at LCL (+0.2% compared to fourth quarter 
2019)  and  stable  expenses  for  International  retail  banking  (-0.1%)  due  to  additional  productivity  efforts  madewithin the entities following their decrease in revenues. Within the Large customers business line, Corporate andinvestment banking posted very good cost control (+0.3% compared to fourth quarter 2019), while Asset servicing 
posted an increase of +7.9% in expenses notably due to a scope effect. Specialised financial services posted a 
-3.8% decrease in expenses in underlying terms, but a +4.0% increase on a like-for-like basis20 over the quarter.Thus, underlying gross operating income rose high to €2,090 million, an increase of +7.8% from fourth quarter2019.  This  was  due  to  a  strong  and  increased  contribution  from  Asset  gathering  (+6.2%  compared  to  fourthquarter  2019),  Retail  banking  (+3.4%)  and  the  resilience of  the  other  business  lines:  Large  customers  -0.4%,Specialised financial services -1.8% in underlying terms and -5.5% on a like-for-like basis.21 Excluding the scope effect of Sabadell and the establishment of Amundi Bank of China Wealth Management17/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020As at 31 December 2020, risk indicators confirmed the high quality of Crédit Agricole S.A.'s assets and risk 
coverage level. The diversified loan  book is mainly  geared towards home loans (28% of gross outstandings)and corporates (44% of Crédit Agricole S.A. gross outstandings). The non-performing loan ratio was still low at 
3.2% (-0.2 percentage point compared to 30 September 2020), while the coverage ratio22 was high, at 71.5% 
and up +1.7 percentage points for the quarter. Loan loss reserves totalled €9.6 billion for Crédit Agricole S.A.,down compared to 30 September 2020, following loan disposals at CA Italia for €450 million. Of these loan loss 
reserves,  28%  were  for  performing  loan  provisioning.  Provisioning  levels  this  quarter  were  based  on  several 
weighted  economic  scenarios  –  revised  in  fourth  quarter  2020  –    with  notably  for  GDP  in  France:  a  morefavourable  scenario  (+7.1%  in  2021  and  +2,7%  in  2022)  and  a  less  favourable  scenario  (+3.0%  in  2021  and 
+4.8% in 2022)23, and included flat-rate adjustments for retail banking portfolios and for corporates and specific 
additions for some target sectors such as aerospace, hotels, tourism, restaurants.The  increase  in  cost  of  risk  was  kept  under  control  (x1.5/-€161 million  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2019,at -€500 million, versus -€340 million in fourth quarter 2019 and -€577 million in third quarter 2020). 77% of the 
increased cost of risk compared to fourth quarter 2019 was due to additional performing loan provisioning (Stages1  &  2),  related  notably  to  prudent  provisioning  in  sensitive  sectors  (such  as  aerospace,  cruise  ships,  hotels,tourism, restaurants and certain small businesses). The -€500 million expense in third quarter 2020 consisted of 
performing  loan  provisioning  (Stages  1  &  2)  totalling  -€193 million  (versus  a  reversal  of  €184 million  in  fourthquarter 2019 and an allocation of -€165 million in third quarter 2020) and provisioning for proven risks (Stage 3)amounting to -€291 million (versus -€531 million in fourth quarter 2019 and -€425 million in third quarter 2020). 
In full year 2020, the cost of risk on outstandings stood at 62 basis points (47 basis points in annualised quartersfor fourth quarter  2020).  Accordingly,  LCL  posted  cost  of  risk  at  -€89 million  (x1.4 compared  to fourth quarter2019 and a modest increase (+7.7%) since the third quarter 2020), with a ratio cost of risk relative to outstandings 
stable at 29 basis points for full year 2020 (25 basis points on an annualised quarterly basis); CA Italia recordeda cost of risk of -€113 million in fourth quarter 2020, i.e. 1.8 times the level of fourth quarter 2019, and an increaseby +30% as compared to the third quarter 2020, with cost of risk relative to outstandings increasing to 93 basis 
points for full year 2020 (95 basis points on an annualised quarterly basis); CA Consumer Finance’s cost of riskwas stable at -€128 million compared to third quarter 2020 and up +11.0% in underlying terms and stable sincethe  third  quarter  2020  +1,3%,  with  cost  of  risk  on  outstandings  at  179  basis  points  for  full  year  2020  (and 
150 basis points on a quarterly annualised basis). Lastly, in financing activities, the cost of risk for the quarterstood  at  -€121 million,  versus  an  allocation  of  just  -€58 million  in  fourth  quarter  2019,  but  was  up  +51%  ascompared to the third quarter 2020. Its cost of risk on outstandings was 67 basis points for full year 2020 (versus41 basis points on a quarterly annualised basis).The contribution in underlying terms of the equity-accounted entities was down -38.3%, to €47 million, notablydue  to  Specialised  financial  services    with  deteriorated  performance  of  international  entities,  partiallycompensated by the resilience of automobile joint-ventures.22 Provisioning rate calculated with outstandings in Stage 3 as denominator, and the sum of the provisions recorded in Stages 1, 2 and 3 as numerator 
23 A decrease of 10 points in the weight of the favourable scenario towards the less favourable scenario would lead to a change in “forward-lookingcentral” ECL inventory of around 5% of total ECL inventory. However, such a change in the weight would not necessarily have a significant impact 
due to “forward looking local” adjustments, which could mitigate the effect.18/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Net  income  on  other  assets  this  quarter  showed  a  negative  impact  of  -€9 million,  related  to  declassified  ITprojects  versus a positive impact of +€20 million in fourth quarter 2019 which was due to a real estate capitalgain in Wealth Management.Underlying income24 before tax, discontinued operations and non-controlling interests was therefore down -4.1%, 
to  €1,628 million.  Underlying  effective  tax  rate  was  29.7%,  up  +16.2 percentage points  compared  to  fourth 
quarter 2019,  whose  level  had  been  very  low  at  13.5%,  a  consequence  of  favourable  legal  cases  at  CréditAgricole CIB. The underlying tax charge therefore increased two-fold to -€469 million. At end 2020, it amounted 
to 22.6% (versus 24.4% in 2019). The underlying net income before non-controlling interests was thereforedown -21.6%.Non-controlling interests stood at -€185 million in fourth quarter 2020, i.e. a +15.0% increase, notably due toa change in Insurance in the recognition methods used for subordinated debt (RT1) coupons, without impact onnet earnings per share, and following CACEIS’s acquisitions of 2020.Underlying net income Group share was down -26.0% from fourth quarter 2019 to €1,318 million.24  See Appendixes for more details on specific items.19/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Credit Agricole S.A. – Stated and underlying results, 2020 and 2019€mRevenuesOperating expenses

the decline in results, compared to full year 2019 and the increase in risk weighted assets compared to December2019.Underlying revenues rose by +2.1% compared to full year 2020, thanks to significant growth in revenues in theLarge  customers  business  line  (+10.7%),  while  revenues  in  the  other  business  lines  overall  demonstratedresilience:  -1.4% 
in 
Specialised financial services, in underlying terms or -4.3% on a like-for-like basis15. Overall, recurring revenues,

Crédit  Agricole  S.A.’s  underlying  revenues.  Interest  revenues  contribute  to  37%  of  the  underlying  full-yearrevenues, while commissions contribute by 41%, other revenues (including trading) 10% and insurance 12%.Underlying  operating  expenses  excluding  SRF  were  stable  (-0.3%).  The  contribution  to  the  SRF  andsupervisory costs have increased significantly, it was up +24.7% to €540 million in full year 2020 compared to€433 million in full year 2019. Expenses were stable thanks to excellent operational efficiency by the business 
lines:  Asset  gathering  reduced  expenses  by  -2.4%  compared  to  full  year  2019,  Retail  banking  by  -2.1%  andSpecialised financial services by -5.6% in underlying terms and stable (0.0%) on a like-for-like basis. The Largecustomers business line reported a +6.0% increase in expenses over the full year, but this was mainly due to a 
scope  effect  (with  the  integration  of  Kas  and  S3  within  Asset  Servicing).  The  underlying  cost/income  ratioexcluding SRF was 59.6% over the full year, an improvement of +1.4 percentage points compared to full year2019, and ahead of the target set out in the Medium-Term Plan in June 2019, i.e. 60%.Lastly,  the  cost  of  risk  increased  significantly  during  the  period  (x2.1/-€1,350 million  to  -€2,606 millionversus -€1,256 million for full year 2019).25 See Annexes for details on the calculation of the business lines' ROTE (return on tangible equity) and RONE (return on normalised equity). Thestated ROTE for 2020 stands at 6.2%, and the stated ROTE excluding CA Italia goodwill impairment stand at 8.3%21/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Dividends  
The  dividend  policy  was  adapted  in  2020  to  take  the  exceptional  circumstances  into  account.  Since  Crédit 
Agricole Group and Crédit Agricole S.A. boast very comfortable levels of capital (a CET1 ratio of 17.2% or +8.3percentage points above the SREP requirement for Crédit Agricole Group and 13.1% or 5.2 percentage pointsabove the SREP requirement for Crédit Agricole S.A.), Crédit Agricole S.A.’s Board of Directors will submit to the 
12 May 2021 General Assembly a 2020 dividend of 80 centimes per share, with a scrip dividend payment. Thenominal  amount exceeds  what  would have been our traditional  payout ratio of 50%  in cash, and allows us tocompensate a portion of the unpaid 2019 dividend. This amount is made possible by SAS La Boétie's commitment 
to subscribe to the scrip dividend payment option. The proposed mechanism is in strict compliance with the ECB’s15 December 2020 recommendation.The proposed dividend means that all shareholders will receive a return of 8%, based upon a €10 share price26. 
To limit the impact of this mechanism on earnings per share which, assuming zero public participation in the scripdividend  payment  option,  and  assuming  participation  in  said  option  by  the  employee  mutual  funds  (FCPEs), 
would be less than -6%, Crédit Agricole S.A.commits to fully unwind the switch guarantee mechanism27 by the 
end of 2022, with 50% of it (i.e. an additional 15%) completed by first quarter 2021. The full unwinding will havea positive impact on Crédit Agricole S.A.’s net income Group share of +€141 million (+€190 million in revenues)on a full year, and on earnings per share around 4%, resulting in an impact on Crédit Agricole S.A.'s CET1 ratio 
of -90 basis points (of which -20 basis points related to the unwinding of the additional 15% in first quarter 2021).Assuming zero public participation in the scrip dividend payment option, the overall effect on earnings per sharewould be around -1%. Crédit Agricole S.A. moreover intends to put in place a share buyback program, up to a 
maximum of 5% of capital, in two steps: after the payment of the dividend, in order to  offset the EPS impact ofthe public participation in the scrip dividend payment, and, once regulatory constraints have been lifted, and withthe usual authorization of the ECB, in order to correct the impact of the transaction on the net tangible assets pershare.26 Yield calculated based of a 10€ share price. Impact on the 2020 EPS <-6% assuming zero public opting for the scrip dividend payment, taking into 
account the formal commitment of SAS La Boétie to opt for a scrip dividend payment, and assuming that the employee mutual funds (FCPE’s) also 
opt for the scrip dividend payment.27 The Insurance Switch guarantee transfers to the Regional Banks the regulatory prudential requirements related to Crédit Agricole S.A.’s equityinterest in Crédit Agricole Assurances.22/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Analysis of the results of Crédit Agricole S.A.’s divisions 
and business lines ActivityAsset gatheringIn Savings/Retirement, Crédit Agricole Assurances continued to diversify its product mix in 2020, having madeadjustments to its offering over the past year. Thus, net inflows were positive (+€1 billion), despite the euro outflow(-€3.9 billion),  and  thanks  to robust  UL net inflows  (+26.9%  versus  fourth  quarter  2019).  Furthermore,  the  ULshare accounted for 38.7% of gross inflows in 2020, an increase of +9.8 percentage points from 2019. In fourth 
quarter 2020, net inflows were negative in euro terms (-€0.5 billion) but up in terms of the number of unit-linkedcontracts  (+€1.3 billion).  Total  net  inflows  stood at  +€0.8 billion,  down  -€0.2 billion compared  to fourth quarter2019 but up +€0.4 billion from third quarter 2020. Assets (savings, retirement and death and disability) stood at 
€308.3 billion, up +1.4% from December 2019. Unit-linked contracts as a percentage of outstandings reached ahistoric high of 24.2%, up +1.4 percentage points from December 2019. Premium income amounted to €6.1 billionin fourth quarter 2020 (stable compared to fourth quarter 2019). Lastly, the Policy Participation Reserve (PPE) 
stood at €11.6 billion at 31 December 2020, which was 5.6% of total outstandings. The average yield of the CréditAgricole Assurances group’s assets was 2.13% in 2020, well above even the average guaranteed minimum rate(0.27% at end 2020) and the profit sharing rate of euro-denominated policies of 1.28% at the end of 2020. The 
adjustment these policies in the context of low interest rates, from 1.44% to 1.28%, allowed the spread betweenthe return on assets and the return on liabilities to be maintained.In  property and  casualty  insurance,  business  in fourth quarter  2020  was  dynamic  compared  fourth  quarter2019,  with  a  growth  of  7.7%,  confirming  the  rebound  seen  in  third  quarter  2020.  Premium  income  stood  at 
€4.8 billion in 2020, up +5.8%28 from 2019. With a net contribution for the year of more than 508,000 policies, the 
number of property and casualty policies in the portfolio of Crédit Agricole Assurances was close to 14.6 million 
at  end  2020,  a  year-on-year  increase  of  +3.6%.  The  equipment  rate  for  individual  customers29  continued  to 
increase in the Regional Bank networks (41.7% at end December 2020, i.e. a +1.0 percentage point increasesince  December  2019)  and  LCL  (25.5%  at  end  December  2020,  i.e.  a  +0.5 percentage  point  increase  since 
December 2019), as well as at CA Italia (17.1% at end December 2020, i.e. a +1.7 percentage point increasesince December 2019). The combined ratio remained under control at 94.9%, down slightly year-on-year by -1.0percentage points. This ratio was calculated excluding the cost of the extra-contractual mutualist mechanism for 
small  businesses  with  operating  loss  cover,  excluding  the  contribution  to  the  solidarity  fund  for  very  smallbusinesses and independent workers, and excluding the exceptional contribution for supplementary healthcarecontributions. Excluding these adjustments, the combined ratio was 97.6%.In death & disability/creditor/group insurance, premium income stood at €4.2 billion, an increase of +5,7%26 
from 2019, with a positive contribution from the three business lines. Premium income amounted to €1.1 billion 
this quarter, up 8.9%28 compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.Asset Management (Amundi) recorded good business growth this quarter, with strong momentum in net inflowsexcluding JVs (+€29.8 billion) thanks to a good level of net inflows in both MLT assets and treasury products. Asa  result,  Amundi  posted  net  MLT  inflows  of  +€12.3 billion,  driven  by  Retail  excluding  JVs  (+€6.4 billion)  and 
Institutionals & Corporates (+€5.8 billion). Inflows on treasury products remained high at +€17.5 billion, driven byCorporates.  Net  inflows  on  joint  ventures  totalled  +€6.0 billion  excluding  outflows  of  low-margin  products  (-€21.6 billion) related to institutional mandates in India and channel business in China. Assets under management 
were up +4.6% from December 2019 to €1,729 billion at end December 2020. Assets under management include 
Sabadell  AM,  which  has  been  included  in  Amundi’s  consolidation  scope  since  July  1st  2020  with  AUM  of 
€20.7 billion. The market/foreign exchange impact on assets under management was +€52.1 billion compared 
to  September  2020.  Note  that  the  joint  venture  with  BOC Wealth  Management,  which  was  operational  in  Q428 Increases adjusted for a change in accounting method; excluding adjustment, growth was +16.4% Q4/Q4 and +7.6% compared to 2019 in Property& Casualty insurance and +10.2% Q4/Q4 and +6.1% in Death & Disability/Creditor/Group insurance.29 Equipment rate: percentage of individual banking customers holding at least one insurance product (Pacifica estimates).

Lastly,  this  year  Amundi  established  AmundiTechnology, a technology services business line, with a target of €150 million in revenues by 2025. In January 
2021, BNY Mellon and Amundi announced their technology partnership in order to provide asset managementcustomers an integrated offering.In wealth management, assets under management were down slightly in fourth quarter 2020. In January 2021,Azqore,  a  subsidiary  of  CAIWM,  signed  an  agreement  with  Société  Générale  to  perform  the  back-officeoperations and a large percentage of the IT services for the international part of Société Générale private bank.The  Asset  Gathering  (AG)  business  line  posted  underlying net income  Group  share  of  €513 million  in  fourthquarter 2020, down -12.0% compared to fourth quarter 2019 notably due to a change in the recognition methodsused  for  subordinated  debt  coupons  (without  impact  on  net  earnings  per  share).  Net  income  Group  share 
remained unchanged excluding this effect. The business line contributed by  41% to the underlying net incomeGroup  share  of  the  Crédit Agricole S.A.  core  businesses  (excluding  the  Corporate  Centre  division)  in  fourthquarter 2020 and 28% to underlying revenues excluding the Corporate Centre.The Asset Gathering (AG)  business line  posted underlying net income Group share of €1,879 million  in 2020,down -7.6% from 2019.As at 31 December 2020, own funds allocated to the business line amounted to €10.6 billion, including €9.1 billion 
for Insurance, €1.0 billion for Asset Management, and €0.5 billion for Wealth Management. The business line’srisk-weighted  assets  accounted  for  €43.0 billion,  including  €27.3 billion  for  Insurance,  €10.7 billion  for  AssetManagement and €5.0 billion for Wealth Management.Underlying RONE (Return on Normalised Equity) stood at 22.5% for the full year of 2020, versus 27.5% for 2019.InsuranceUnderlying revenues totalled €734 million in fourth quarter 2020, a year-on-year increase of +3.4%, largely dueto a positive market effect of +€60 million compared to fourth quarter 2019. Underlying expenses fell sharply by-7.5% in fourth quarter 2020 versus fourth quarter 2019, to €179 million. This was mainly due to tax cuts, which 
resulted  in  an  increase  in  underlying  GOI  of  +7.4%  to  €555 million  in  fourth  quarter  2020.  The  underlyingcost/income ratio in fourth quarter 2020 stood at 24.4%, an improvement of -2.9 percentage points compared tofourth quarter 2019. The tax charge was up +57% to €206 million due to non-deductible additions to provisions 
in  fourth  quarter  2020.  Underlying  net  income  thus  totalled  €351 million,  down  -8.9%  compared  to  fourthquarter 2019. In the end, the business line's contribution to underlying net income Group share was down -17.6%,to €317 million, mostly due to non-controlling interests (€34 million in fourth quarter 2020) following a change inthe recognition methods used for subordinated RT1 debt coupons (without impact on net earnings per share).Underlying  revenues  totalled  €2,557 million  in  2020,  down  -2.3%  from  2019.  Underlying  expenses  remainedunder control, rising just +0.9% over the period to €761 million. As a result, underlying GOI decreased by -3.6% 
to €1,796 million, and the cost/income ratio deteriorated slightly by +1.0 percentage points to 29.8% for full-year2020. Compared to 2019, underlying net income decreased by -3.4% to €1,287 million and underlying net incomeGroup share by -9.2% to €1,207 million, mostly due to a change in the recognition methods used for subordinated 
RT1 debt coupons (without impact on net earnings per share). Without this impact, the decline in net incomeGroup share would have been more limited (-3.4% versus 2019).Crédit Agricole Assurances also demonstrated its solidity and resilience with a Solvency 2 regulatory prudential 
ratio still high at 227% at 31 December 2020.24/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020 
 
 
Asset managementUnderlying  revenues  totalled  €712  million  in  fourth  quarter  2020,  up  +1.4%  on  fourth  quarter  2019.  Net 
management revenues were up +2.0% on fourth quarter 2019, driven by the +0.9% increase in net managementfee  and  commission  income  and  the  sharp  +9.8%  increase  in  performance  fee  and  commission  income.Underlying  expenses  excluding  SRF  remained  under  control  (+3.0%),  at  €379  million.  This  increase  can  be 
explained by the Sabadell scope effect, and the creation of Amundi Bank of China WM.  Without these differenteffects,  expenses  would  have  dropped  -0.9%.  Underlying  GOI  was  stable  (-0.3%)  at  €334  million  and  thecost/income ratio excluding SRF remained at a good level at 53.2%, slightly down year-on-year (+0.8 percentage 
points).  The  contribution  of  equity-accounted  entities,  comprising  in  particular  income  from  Amundi’s  jointventures  in  Asia,  was  up +49.9%  on  fourth quarter  2020  and reached  €20  million. The  underlying tax  chargestayed unchanged (-0.9%) at €84 million this quarter. In the end, underlying net income Group share was solidand rose by +2.2% compared to fourth quarter 2019, to €180 million.In full-year 2020, revenues fell -4.3% compared to 2019 to €2,522 million. Underlying expenses excluding SRFfell -2.5% to €1,367 million. Accordingly, underlying GOI was down -6.4% to €1,152 million and the underlying 
cost/income ratio excluding SRF remained at a good level (54.2%), slightly down 1.0 percentage point comparedto  2019.  Underlying  income  of  equity-accounted  entities  rose  sharply  (+43.5%)  to  €66  million.  In  the  end,underlying net income Group share decreased by -5.9% compared to 2019, to €600 million.Wealth managementUnderlying revenues rose +4.6% compared to fourth quarter 2019 to €219 million in fourth quarter 2020, thanks 
in  particular  to  the  resilience  of  performance  fees.  Underlying  costs  excluding  SRF  dropped  (-4.2%)  to  €177million  mainly  due  to  the  savings  plan.  Accordingly,  underlying  GOI  increased  significantly  year-on-year  by+69.2%,  to  €42  million  and  the  underlying  cost/income  ratio  excluding  SRF  significantly  improved  by  -7.4 
percentage points to 80.7% in fourth quarter 2020. Cost of risk totalled €21 million and the tax charge droppedby -48.4% to €4 million. In the end, underlying net income Group share fell -27.9% to €15 million in fourth quarter2020. The recognition, this quarter, of €23 million in specific items with an impact on net income Group shareshould be noted. These losses are related to an ongoing disposal plan for the Miami and Brazilian entities.Revenues totalled €820 million in 2020, stable (-0.6%) compared with 2019. Underlying expenses excluding SRFdecreased significantly (-5.7%) to €698 million. Accordingly, underlying GOI increased sharply (+48.5% to €119 
million)  and  the  underlying  cost/income  ratio  excluding  SRF  improved  (-4.7  percentage  points)  to  85.2%.Underlying net income Group share was up +8.4% to €72 million in 2020.25/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Retail BankingThe Group’s Retail banking continued to support the economy and activity remains strong in the fourth quarter.The impact of the second lockdown ended up being limited, as reflected in the resumption of loan production:€7.8 billion for LCL (+13%  since third quarter  2020 respectively), of  which €1.9 billion in the corporate market 
(+59% since third quarter 2020 respectively) and €3.9 billion in the home loans market (stable since third quarter2020  respectively);  and  €2.3 billion  for  CA  Italia  with  record  home  loan  production  of  €1.0 billion  (+2.7%  and+42.9% versus third quarter 2020 respectively). The level of outstanding loans remained high at €143.4 billion 
for  LCL  (+10.5%  year-on-year)  and  €45.5 billion  in  Italy  (+5.0%  year-on-year),  despite  the  disposal  of  non-performing loans amounting to €450 million in fourth quarter 2020. As at 31 December 2020, state-guaranteedloan  outstandings  stood  at  €8 billion  for  LCL  and  €2.4 billion  for  CA  Italia.  Excluding  state-guaranteed  loans, 
outstanding  loans  were  also  up  year-on-year  for  LCL  (+4.4%),  driven  by  small  business  loans  (+11.8%)  and 
home loans (+4.5%). For CA Italia numbers were stable (+0.5%30). In France, renegotiations on LCL home loans 
continued to trend downwards in fourth quarter to €0.2 billion in outstandings, compared with €0.3 billion in the 
third  quarter  of  2020  and  €1 billion  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2019.  This  was  still  well  below  the  high  point  of€5.2 billion  in  fourth  quarter  2016.  Lastly,  for  all  International  retail  banking  excluding  Italy,  loan  growth  was 
+4.7%25  at  end  December  2020  versus  end  December  2019,  driven  primarily  by  Ukraine  (+18.4%25),  Egypt 
(+10.0%31) and Poland (+2.5%25), with Morocco remaining stable (-0.7%25). On-balance sheet deposits at LCL 
were up  +11.5%  year-on-year  in  line  with the  increase in  precautionary  household  savings  and  deposits  of  aportion of  the state-guaranteed  loans  that  were granted  to  promote  corporate liquidity.  Against  this  backdrop, 
demand  deposits  showed  a  rise  for  both  individual  customers  (+15.5%  Dec/Dec)  and  small  business  andcorporate  customers  (+51.9%  Dec/Dec).  At  CA  Italia,  on-balance  sheet  deposits  were  also  up  year-on-year(+8.9%), for the most part demand deposits of individual and corporate customers (+11.1%). Off-balance sheet 
savings  were  down  slightly  at  LCL  (-1.1%),  particularly  in  life  insurance  (-1.6%),  reflecting  the  market  effectsrelated to the public health crisis which were still negative for the year. At CA Italia, off-balance sheet depositswere up year-on-year (+8.8%), driven by life insurance deposits (+13.8%). Customer assets increased by +12.2% 
year-on-year  for  all  International  Retail  Banking  excluding  Italy,  driven  by  Ukraine  (+50.1%32)  and  Poland 
(+12.5%28),  with  more  modest  growth  in  Morocco  (+5.1%28)  and  Egypt  (+4.1%28).  The  equipment  rate  in 
automotive, multi-risk household, healthcare, legal or accident insurance rose to 25.5% at LCL (+0.5 percentage 
point  compared  to  end  December  2019)  and  17.1%  at  CA  Italia  (+1.7  percentage  points  compared  to  endDecember 2019).French retail bankingUnderlying revenues were up +4.5% compared to fourth quarter 2019, to €902 million in fourth quarter 2020. Thisincrease  was  driven  by  the  net  interest  margin  (+16.2%),  supported  by  good  refinancing  conditions.  Fee  and 
commission  income  dropped  (-4.4%)  with  an  electronic  payments  activity  impacted  by  the  sanitary  crisis.Underlying costs excluding SRF remained under control at €599 million in fourth quarter 2020 (+0.2%), whichleads to an improvement in the underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF of 2.9 percentage points year-on-
year,  to  66.4%.  This  made  it  possible  to  achieve  underlying  gross  operating  income  of  €304  million,  a  sharpimprovement (+14.2%) on fourth quarter 2019. Cost of risk stayed high (+39.1% compared to fourth quarter 2019)and  totalled  -€89  million  in  fourth  quarter  2020.  This  increase  can  be  explained  by  prudent  provisioning  of 
performing  loans,  which  entails,  first,  prudent  provisioning  in  sensitive  sectors  (such  as  hospitality,  tourism,restaurants)  and  secondly,  the  update  of  economic  scenarios.  The  doubtful  loans  ratio  stands  at  1.5%  (-0.1percentage point compared to third quarter 2020) and the coverage ratio stands at 86.2% (+1.6 percentage points 
compared to third quarter 2020). All in all, underlying net income Group share was up +0.6% compared to fourthquarter 2019, to €140 million in fourth quarter 2020.30 Excluding disposal of non-performing loans

32 Excluding foreign exchange impact.26/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Revenues were up +1.4% in full-year 2020 compared to 2019, to €3,537 million. Underlying expenses excludingSRF decreased by -2.7%, due in particular to a continued improvement in external expenses, which resulted in 
a  -2.7  percentage  point  improvement  in  the  underlying  cost/income  ratio  excluding  SRF  to  64.4%.  Grossoperating income thus fell  sharply (+9.1%  at €1,218  million). Cost of risk was up in full-year  2020 (+79.9% to€390 million), but this increase was mostly (+€191 million) due to performing loans provisioning. The businessline’s contribution to net income Group share fell -7.1% to €548 million.The underlying RoNE (return on normalized equity) of LCL stood at 9.7% for 2020, compared to 10.8% for 2019.International retail bankingInternational  retail  banking  revenues  fell  by  -2.8%  to  €692  million  in  fourth  quarter  2020.  Underlying  costsremained virtually unchanged (-0.1%), at €453 million. As a result, underlying gross operating income decreased 
by -7.7% to €239 million. Cost of risk increased +67.5% this quarter to -€131 million. All in all, net income Groupshare of International retail banking was €70 million, down -33.3% compared to the fourth quarter 2019.For the full-year 2020, underlying revenues decreased -4.9% to €2,659 million. Underlying operating expenses 
excluding  SRF  were  down  -1.3%  to  €1,708  million,  resulting  in  a  2.3  percentage  point  deterioration  in  theunderlying  cost/income  ratio  to  64.3%.  SRF  increased  by  14.2%  to  -€25 million.    Gross  underlying  operatingincome  totalled  €925  million,  down  -11.2%.  Excluding  SRF,  the  drop  in  gross  operating  income  is  lowered 
to -10.7%.  Provisioning increased by 70.2% to €569 million for full-year 2020. This translated into underlying netincome Group share of €225 million for full-year 2020 (down -40.6%).ItalyCrédit Agricole Italia’s revenues were slightly up in fourth quarter 2020 compared to 2019 at €490 million (+0.9% 
compared to fourth quarter 2019).  Net interest margin fell in spite of the favourable refinancing terms, and feeand  commission  income  returned  to  the  fourth  quarter  2019  level  thanks  to  credit  insurance  and  UCITS.Underlying costs fell slightly year-on-year (+1.1%) following the investments made in new distribution models that 
were not offset by savings on recurring costs. Underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF remained unchangedat  65.5%  (+0.1 percentage points  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2019).  Cost  of  risk  increased  +81.9%  to  ­€113million, a well-controlled level reflecting both an additional provisions on a €450 million doubtful loans disposal 
and an increase in provisions for proven risks (46% of the increase in cost of risk related to the provisioning ofperforming loans). The cost of risk on outstandings for the year therefore stood at 93 basis points. The ratio ofnon performing loans loans improved this quarter to 6.5% (-0.8 percentage points Dec/Sept) thanks to the loan 
disposal, and the coverage ratio stood at 60.8% on portfolio loans. Excluding loan disposals, the coverage ratioimproved by 120 basis points.For full-year 2020, revenues dropped -3.0% to €1,827 million. Operating expenses excluding SRF were down by 
only -0.9%, resulting in a deterioration in the underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF, which stood at 64.0%,an increase of 1.4 percentage points Dec./Dec. Gross operating income was down -7.2%, to €632 million (-6.5%excluding  SRF).  Lastly,  the  business  line’s  contribution to underlying  net  income Group share  was  down  by  -33.3% to €144 million.The underlying RoNE (return on normalized equity) of CA Italia stood at 5.7% for the full-year 2020, compared 
to 9.3% for 2019.27/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Crédit Agricole Group in ItalyThe Group’s results in Italy were €579 million for full-year 2020, i.e. a -11% decrease compared to full-year 2019 
due to the increase in cost of risk.International Retail Banking – excluding ItalyUnderlying revenues declined in fourth quarter 2020 compared to fourth quarter 2019 (-11.0%), mainly due to anet interest margin still impacted by the fall in reference interest rates in Egypt, Poland, Ukraine and Morocco, 
and fee and commission income affected by the slowdown in commercial activity.  However, there was a +3.8%uptick in revenues compared to third quarter 2020. Underlying costs also fell by -2.8%. As expenses declinedless than revenues, the underlying cost/income ratio of IRB excluding Italy deteriorated this quarter to 65.4%, up 
+5.5  points.  Underlying  gross  operating  income  thus  decreased  by  -23.1%.  Cost  of  risk  increased  (+12.9%)to -€18 million in fourth quarter 2020. The coverage ratio was up 5 percentage points compared to third quarter2020 at 109%. All in all, underlying net income Group share stood at €37 million, i.e. a decrease of -27.8%.By country:-  CA  Egypt (33):  underlying  revenues  were  down  -8%  in  fourth  quarter  2020  compared  to fourth  quarter 
2019, penalised by lower rates. The risk profile remained good with a low NPL ratio of 3.1% and a highcoverage ratio of 166%.-  CA Poland(33): revenues decreased this quarter (-20%), penalised by the decrease in reference rates and 
despite a sustained level of new business in the quarter (+16,000 clients). Costs also fell (-3%) leadingto a -56% decline in gross operating income. The non performing loans coverage ratio rose to 116% .-  CA Ukraine(33): underlying revenues were slightly up this quarter (+1%) as a result of a sharp upturn in 
commercial  activity.  The  17%  increase  in  costs  reflects  investments  made  in  digital  technology  and 
network  transformation.  NPL  ratio  improved  to  1.4%  (-2.7  percentage  points  compared  to  December2019) and the coverage ratio stayed very high at 351%.-  Crédit du Maroc(33): revenues remained unchanged, and costs fell sharply (-19%). Provisioning remainedprudent, with the coverage ratio reaching 94% (+3 percentage points compared to September 2020).For full-year 2020, revenues were down by -8.8% to €833 million. Operating expenses decreased by -2.3% only,which  resulted  in  a  deterioration  of  the  underlying  cost/income  ratio  to  64.7%,  up  by  4.3  percentage  points 
Dec./Dec.  Underlying  gross  operating  income  stood  at  €294  million,  down  -18.7%.  Cost  of  risk  totalled€142 million, up 69.6%. All in all, the business-line’s contribution to net income Group share totalled €81 million,down -50.3%.The underlying RoNE (return on normalized equity) of other IRB stood at 12.3% for the year 2020, compared to19.3% for 2019.The International retail  banking business line contributed for 5% to the underlying net income Group share  ofCrédit Agricole S.A.'s core businesses (excluding the Corporate Centre division) in 2020 and 13% to underlyingrevenues excluding the Corporate Centre.The  entire  Retail  banking  business  line  contributed  for  17%  to  the  underlying  net  income  Group  share  ofCrédit Agricole S.A.'s core businesses (excluding the Corporate Centre division) in 2020 and 30% to underlyingrevenues excluding the Corporate Centre.As of 31 December 2020, the capital allocated to the division was €8.7 billion including €4.9 billion for Frenchretail banking and €3.8 billion for International retail banking. Risk weighted assets totalled €91.6 billion including€52.0 billion for French retail banking and €49.5 billion for International retail banking.33 Excluding forex effect28/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Specialised Financial ServicesSpecialised  financial  services  activity  rebounded  in  December  after  a  limited  second  lockdown  impact.  CAConsumer  Finance’s  loan  production  in  fourth  quarter  2020  was  up  compared  to  third  quarter  2020  (+1.8%), 
reaching €11.1 billion (-3% compared to fourth quarter 2019) returning to the average level of 2019. The reasonfor  this  was  the  strong  performance  of  the  automobile  JVs  (+11%  in  fourth  quarter  2020  compared  to  fourthquarter 2019). In France, loan production withstood the impact of the second wave of covid-19, slipping by just -
3% in fourth quarter 2020 compared to fourth quarter 2019. The production margin on depreciable loans remained 
stable, except for automobile JV this quarter. Gross managed loans were more or less stable year-on-year (-1.3% compared  to December 2019), resulting in the postponement to  2023 of the  gross managed loans 
target  initially  announced  for  2022,  cost/income  ratio  and  RoNE  targets  being  achievable  by  2022.Nevertheless,  the  rebound  in  gross  managed  loans  that  began  in  September  2020  continued  (+1.9%  at  end 
December 2020 compared with September, after +0.9% between June and September 2020). At CAL&F, leasing 
production showed good momentum, reaching €1.8 billion in fourth quarter 2020, higher than the already verygood level of fourth quarter 2019 (+0.8%). This sharp upturn compared to third quarter 2020 (+28.7%) was driven 
by  France’s  and  Poland’s  performances.  The  gross  consolidated  loans  were  up  year-on-year  (+3.2%  atDecember 2020 compared to 2019), driven by France. Factoring  activity had a very good fourth quarter 2020 
with factored revenues up by +4.4% from fourth quarter 2019. However, this level of  activity was not directlyreflected  in  the  change  in  overall  revenues  because  there  was  a  decline  in  the  share  of  turnover  subject  to 
factoring,  in  the  context  of  lower  liquidity  requirements  for  corporates  considering  exceptional  governmentalliquidity support measures such as SGLs.Fourth  quarter  2020  results  of  Specialised  financial  services  were  resilient.  Gross  operating  income  wasslightly  down  (-1.8%  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2019)  and  cost/income  ratio  improved  to  48.8%  (i.e.  -0.5percentage  point  decrease).  In  addition,  the  cost  of  risk  increase  was  brought  below  50%  over  the  full  year2020. The results of the year have been marked by the reclassification under IFRS 5 on third quarter of the Dutchsubsidiary CACF Nederland BV, an entity held for sale. In fourth quarter 2020, this translated into the posting ofCA Consumer Finance NL’s fourth quarter income to net  income from held-for-sale operations of  -€66 million 
(classified  under  specific  items  of  the  quarter  and  subtracted  from  underlying  results).  Accordingly,  in  fourth 
quarter 2020, the business line’s underlying net income Group share stood at €165 million, i.e. a decline of -22.3% and of -25.4% at constant scope compared to fourth quarter 2019 (i.e. excluding CA Consumer FinanceNL).The business line contributed  13% to the underlying  net income Group share of the Crédit Agricole S.A. corebusinesses (excluding the Corporate Centre Division) for full-year 2020RoNE (return on normalised equity) of the business line stood at 11.7% for full-year 2020 compared to 16% in2019. Own funds allocated to the business line totalled €4.9 billion, compared to €5.2 billion in 2019.29/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Consumer financeIn  the  fourth  quarter  2020,  CA  Consumer  Finance’s  underlying  revenues  totalled  €502 million,  down  -4.0%compared to fourth quarter 2019, due to an unfavourable product mix and competitive pressures. However, on a 
constant scope basis, i.e., excluding CA Consumer Finance NL34, underlying revenues contracted slightly by -
1.9%. Gross operating income remained stable compared to fourth quarter 2019 (-0.3% and -5.2% excluding 
scope effect, due to a base effect on fourth quarter 2019 expenses). As such, the cost/income ratio excludingSRF, up 1.9 percentage points compared to fourth quarter 2019, stood at 48.1% this quarter (excluding scopeeffect,  cost/income  ratio  increases  of  1.8  percentage  points,  due  to  a  base  effect  on  fourth  quarter  2019 
expenses). Equity-accounted entities totalled €140 million this quarter, i.e. a multiplication by 2.2 compared tofourth quarter 2019, on account of a partial provision reversal on a €89 million fine issued to FCA Bank by AGCM,the  Italian  competition  authority,  restated  under  specific  items.  Consequently,  the  equity-accounted  entities 
underlying contribution contracted by -22.7% compared to fourth quarter 2019, notably impacted by the results 
of the other international entities, especially Wafasalaf, slightly more affected by the crisis. However, cost of riskwas kept under control during the second wave of the pandemic, up by a mere 1.3% compared to the previous 
quarter, and up by only 11.0% compared to fourth quarter 2019 (+23% excluding scope effect). Cost of risk onoutstandings  stood  at  179  basis  points,  down  9  basis  compared  to  annualised  September  2020.  NPL  ratiostood  at  6.8%,  down  0.5  percentage  point  compared  to  September  2020.  All  in  all,  underlying  net  income 
Group  share  totalled  €128  million  this  quarter,  down  19%  on fourth  quarter  2019 and  -23%  excluding  scopeeffect.For full-year 2020, CACF recorded resilient results during the crisis, for instance, compared to 2019, CA-CF’s 
underlying  revenues  dropped  -7.1%  and  -3.7%  excluding  scope  effect.  Cost/income  ratio  excluding  SRFslightly improved and reached 49.3% (compared to 49% on full year 2019). Cost of risk rose by only 41.3% thisyear compared to 2019. Equity-accounted entities contribution fell (-13.9%) due to the poor performance ofother international entities (particularly at Wafasalaf, which was slightly more impacted by the health crisis) partly 
offset by the resilience of the automotive joint ventures. CA Consumer Finance’s underlying net income Groupshare  for  the  year  decreased  by  -21.9%  and  by  -22%  excluding  scope  effect.  Lastly,  the  business  line’scontribution to net income Group share in full-year 2020 was 11%.Leasing & FactoringIn fourth quarter 2020, the underlying revenues of CAL&F totalled €152 million, slightly up by 1.5% comparedto fourth quarter 2020, thanks to robust recovery of the activity that began in June 2020 but again curbed by afactoring business, which was penalised by a decrease in the share of factored turnover resulting from the impact 
of State-guaranteed loans for corporates. Cost/income ratio returned to a normal level at 51.1% this quarter, animprovement  compared  to  third  trimester  2020,  but  slightly  down  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2019  (-4.3 
percentage points). Cost of risk increased sharply (x2.1 compared to fourth quarter 2019, reaching €25 million)notably  related  to  performing  loans  provisioning,  which accounts  for  80%  of  total  outstandings.  Nevertheless, 
CAL&F’s  underlying  net  income  Group  share  was  €37  million  this  quarter,  down  -32%  compared  to  fourthquarter 2019, but up 8.9% compared to the previous quarter.For  full-year  2020,  CAL&F  revenues  decreased  by  -6.7%  compared  to  2019  impacted  by  a  lower  factoringperformance,  strongly  linked  to  the  crisis  and  clients  lower  liquidity  requirements.  This  lead  to  an  increase  in 
cost/income ratio excluding SRF, which rose by 4.6 percentage points to 54.6%. As the cost of risk doubledcompared to 2019, CAL&F’s net income Group share stood at €101 million, down -40.8% compared to 2019.34 Excluding IFRS 5 impact CACF NL in Q4-2030/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Large customersCorporate and Investment Banking activity was brisk in fourth quarter 2020 with stable underlying revenues (-0.5% to €1,157 million) compared to a very high fourth quarter 2019. Capital markets and investment banking(-5.0% to €545 million) continued its revenue normalisation initiated in the third quarter (FICC activities:  -7.4%, 
including CVA) due to a slowdown in hedging activities caused by a massive return of liquidity and lower volatility. 
Bond originations were stable, with a good level of activity (same level in fourth quarter 2020 as in fourth quarter2019). In a normalising market, Crédit Agricole CIB kept its leadership positions (No. 1 in All French Corporate 
bonds,35  No.  1  in  All  Financial  Bonds,36  and  No.  2  worldwide  in  Global  Green  and  Sustainability  bonds37). 
Regulatory  VaR  at  31  December  2020  remained  at  a  low  level,  in  line  with  the  prudent  risk  managementmodel (€9.2 at 31 December 2020 versus €22.2 million at 31 March 2020, average regulatory VaR: €10.9 million 
in  fourth  quarter  2020  versus  €18.8 million  in  second  quarter 2020).  Financing  activities  reported  higherunderlying revenues (+3.9% and +8.6% excluding the foreign exchange impact) in fourth quarter 2020 comparedto fourth quarter  2019, totalling €612 million. They  were driven on the one hand  by  a good  performance from 
commercial  banking  (+6.1%  to  €331 million),  particularly  in  acquisition  financing,  and  on  the  other  hand  bystructured finance (+1.5% to €281 million in the telecoms and energy/infrastructure sectors). In particular, Crédit 
Agricole CIB maintained good positions in syndicated loans: Crédit Agricole CIB is the leader in France and 
No. 3 in the EMEA market. The drawdown rate on revolving credit facilities (RCFs) returned almost to pre-crisislevels. It stood at 20% in fourth quarter 2020, very close to the pre-crisis level of 18%, having reached a highpoint of 32% at the end of April.Lastly, Asset Servicing (CACEIS) recorded a good level of activity this quarter. Assets under custody totalled€4.2 trillion at end December 2020, up +8% year-on-year, exceeding the level in value set as a target in the 2022 
Medium  Term  Plan.  Assets under  administration  also increased by  +6%  to  €2,175 billion. These  increaseswere largely due to customer capture and asset growth in existing customers.In fourth quarter 2020, underlying net income Group share for the Large customers business line amountedto €303 million, down -18.6% compared to third quarter of 2019. Gross operating income was stable (-0.4% infourth  quarter  2020  compared  to  fourth  quarter 2019)  thanks  to  robust  activity  across  all  business  lines,  anddespite the ongoing normalisation for capital markets and investment banking. The business line still reported an 
increase, although it is slowing down, in provisioning (cost of risk increased two-fold to €111 million), particularlyin financing activities (multiplied by 2.1 to €121 million in fourth quarter 2020).In 2020, underlying net income Group share totalled €1,325 million, down -16.1% on the same period in 2019.The business line contributed 29% to the underlying net income Group share of Crédit Agricole S.A.'s corebusinesses  (excluding  the  Corporate  Centre  division)  for  full-year  2020  and  30%  to  underlying  revenuesexcluding the Corporate Centre.At 31 December 2020, own funds allocated to the business line totalled €11.7 billion and risk weighted assetsamounted to €123.6 billion.Underlying RoNE (return on normalised equity) of the business line stood at 10.7% for 2020 compared to 12.7%for 2019.Corporate and investment bankingIn fourth quarter 2020, Corporate and investment banking underlying revenues remain virtually unchanged witha  slight  -0.5%  decrease  to  €1,157 million,  the  normalisation  started  in  the  third  quarter  for  capital  marketscontinued (-5% in fourth quarter 2020 compared to fourth quarter 2019 which was at a high level), subject to the35 Sources: Dealogic

in net revenues (3.9% between the two quarters) with strong performance from commercial banking, driven bythe acquisition financing sector and a good sales momentum on structured finance, particularly on the telecomsand energy/infrastructure business lines. Underlying operating expenses remained well controlled and recorded 
a slight increase of +0.3% in fourth quarter 2020 making it possible to post an underlying cost/income ratio of59.3%,  a  +0.4-point  slight  improvement  on  fourth  quarter  2019.  Thus,  underlying  gross  operating  income  fellslightly this quarter, down -1.5% compared to fourth quarter 2019. Cost of risk increased significantly compared 
to fourth quarter 2019. It doubled to €108 million, mainly due to the increase in performing loans provisioning,notably  on  the  aircraft,  shipping  and  hospitality  sectors,  weakened  by  the  health  crisis.  Compared  to  thirdquarter 2020, cost of risk decreased -51%. In the end, underlying net income Group share was €303 million infourth quarter 2020, a decline of -18.6% compared to fourth quarter 2019.For  full-year  2020,  revenues  recorded  a  marked  increase  of  +8.8%  on  the  same  period  in  2019.  Operatingexpenses excluding SRF contributions recorded a very slight increase (+2.1%), enabling the production of a +6.7 
percentage  point  jaws  effect  and  the  posting  of  cost/income  ratio  excluding  SRF  of  51.5%,  a  3.4-pointimprovement between 2019 and 2020, and a level below the Medium-Term Plan target (less than 55%). Grossoperating income was sharply up by +14.7%, between 2019 and 2020. However, cost of risk multiplied by 5.3 
over the year, 86% of the increase in financing activities linked to performing loans. All in all, the contribution tonet income Group share was €1,195 million, down -16.8% compared to 2019.Risk-weighted assets as of December 2020 decrease by -€1.1 bn compared to end of September 2020. Thisdecrease is due to a reduction of -€5.4 bn in business line activity, including the continued normalisation of VaR(lower market risk and CVA of -€2.3 bn) and a favourable exchange rate impact of -€1.6 bn. Those two downwardelements are partially offset by the increase related to ratings downgrade for +€2.1 bn and model effects linkedto TRIM for +€4.5 bn.Asset servicingIn  fourth  quarter  2020,  underlying  revenues  increased  by  +8.1%  to  €281  million.  Apart  from  the  scope  effectlinked  to  the  consolidation  of  the  results  of  Santander Securities Services  (S3)  since  first  quarter  2020(outstandings were consolidated in fourth quarter 2019), underlying net revenues have been buoyed by a strong 
activity level. Assets under custody totalled €4.2 trillion at 31 December 2020, exceeding the target (4 trillion) ofthe 2022 Medium-Term Plan. They have increased +8% in one year at end December 2020 thanks to the arrivalof  new  customers  (mainly  Groupama  and  Candriam)  and  assets  growth  for  existing  customers.  Underlying 
operating expenses increased by 7.9% to €218 million. Excluding scope effect related to the consolidation of S3,underlying operating expenses increased 2.0% mainly as a result of IT developments and investments, includingsome related to the arrival of new large customers). Underlying gross operating income rose +9.1% to €63 million 
and  cost/income  ratio  was  77.6%  in  fourth  quarter  2020.  Net  underlying  income  totalled  €53  million,  up  by+46.1%.  After  sharing  €17  million  with  Santander’s  non-controlling  interest, the business  line’s  contribution  tounderlying net income Group share posted a drop of -1.1% year-on-year to €36 million.Underlying  revenues  increased  by  +20.5%  in  2020  compared  to  2019,  while  underlying  operating  expensesexcluding  SRF  increased  by  +20.2%.  Underlying  gross  operating  income  increased  by  +17.1%  and  theunderlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF was 75.7%, a slight -0.2 percentage point improvement compared 
to the same period in 2019. As a result, underlying net income increased by +34.5%. In the end, the businessline’s contribution to net income Group share was down -9.1% to €130 million due to the appearance of non-controlling interests in favour of Santander.32/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Corporate CentreAn analysis of the negative contribution of the Corporate Centre looks at both the “structural” contribution andother items. The “structural” contribution includes three types of activities:-the  activities  and  the  role  of  the  corporate  centre  of  Crédit  Agricole S.A.  holding.  This  negative 
contribution reached -€195 million in fourth quarter 2020, down compared to the fourth quarter 2019 (-€52 million) due to an unfavourable tax effect partly offset by lower refinancing costs and temporary gainsrelated to TLTRO III;-the  sub-divisions  that  are  not  part  of  the  core  businesses,  such  as  CACIF  (private  equity)  andCA Immobilier: their contribution of +€6 million in fourth quarter 2020 shows a decline compared to fourthquarter 2019 (-€19 million), due to low fee and commission income at CACIF and the impact of negativevaluations in private equity entities;-the Group’s support functions: the fourth quarter 2020 recorded an increase in operating costs due toend-of-year project catch-up which amounted to -€26 million, down -€19 million.“Other  items”  recorded  a  negative  contribution  of  -€36  million  this  quarter,  compared  to  a  contribution  of  +€5million in fourth quarter 2019. This negative variance is due to seasonal inflation and the impact of the intra-group 
eliminations subscribed by Predica and Amundi.For 2020, the Corporate Centre division made a negative contribution of -€733, an improvement of +€80 millioncompared 2019.  The  structural  component improved significantly  over  the  period (+€113  million),  in particularwith  regard  to  the  activities  and  functions  of  the  corporate  entity  Crédit  Agricole S.A.’s  corporate  centre 
(+€187 million). The other items of the business line contributed +€31 million over the year, down -€33 million.As at 31 December 2020, risk weighted assets amounted to €26.2 billion.***33/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Financial strengthCrédit Agricole GroupOver the quarter, the phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio up by +0.2 percentage points compared toend-June 2020 to reach 17.2%. Therefore, Crédit Agricole Group posted a substantial buffer of 8.3 percentagepoints between the level of its CET1 ratio and the 8.9% SREP requirement for Crédit Agricole Group, comparedwith 8.1 percentage points at 30 September 2020.The fully loaded ratio, in other words excluding the impact of the phasing-in of IFRS 9 incorporated in secondquarter 2020 as part of the “Quick fix”, was 16.9%. The increase was mainly due to the effect of the stated result 
(+27  basis  points)  and  by  risk  weighted  assets  (+17  basis  points)  which decrease in Large Customers  (-€4.3billion  excluding  foreign  exchange  impact).  Risk  weighted  assets  increase  in  retail  banking  (+€0.7  billionexcluding foreign exchange impact) of which +1.4 billion for the Regional banks, +€0.3 for LCL and -€1.2 billion 
for CA Italia). Dividend and AT1 distribution had a downward impact on the CET1 amounting to -8 basis points, 
corresponding to the sum of the  impacts related to the payment of a dividend  of €0.80  per share 38 (-18 basis 
points), to provisions set aside on the basis of the usual pay-out policy (+12 basis points), and to AT1 coupons 
(-2 basis  points).  The  “Methodology  &  regulatory  effects”  contributed  to  the  decrease  of  the  CET1  (-7  basispoints),  with  an  impact  of  the  review  of  internal  models  (TRIM:  -16 basis  point)  partially  offset by  the  positiveimpact of new software processing (+9 basis points). Finally, the “M&A, OCI & Others” had a downward impacton CET1amounting to -2 basis points.The  phased-in  leverage  ratio  stood  at  6.1%,  an  increase  of  +0.3 point  compared  to  end-September 2020 
(increase at 5.6% compared to end-September 2020 before the neutralisation of ECB exposures). The phased-
in Tier 1 ratio stood at  18.3%, the phased-in overall ratio was 21.1% and the phased-in average intra-quarter 
leverage ratio was 5.3% this quarter, before exclusion of the Central Bank exposures.TLACThe Financial Stability Board (FSB) has defined the calculation of a ratio aimed at estimating the adequacy ofthe  bail-in  and 
(G-SIBs).  This 
Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) ratio provides resolution authorities with the means to assess whether G-recapitalisation  capacity  of  Global  SystemicallyImportant  BanksSIBs  have  sufficient  bail-in  and  recapitalisation  capacity  before  and  during  resolution.  It  applies  to  GlobalSystemically Important Banks, and therefore to Crédit Agricole Group.The elements that could absorb losses consist of equity, subordinated notes and debts to which the ResolutionAuthority can apply the bail-in.The TLAC ratio requirement has been transposed into European Union law via CRR2 and has been applicablesince 27 June 2019. As from that date, Crédit Agricole Group must comply with the following requirements at alltimes:-a  TLAC  ratio  above  16%  of  risk  weighted  assets  (RWA),  plus  –  in  accordance  with  CRD5  –  a  combined 
capital buffer requirement (including, for the Crédit Agricole Group, a 2.5% capital conservation buffer, a 1%G-SIB buffer and the counter-cyclical buffer). Considering the combined capital  buffer requirement, CréditAgricole Group must adhere to a TLAC ratio of above 19.5% (plus the counter-cyclical buffer)-a TLAC ratio of above 6% of the Leverage Ratio Exposure (LRE).As from 1 January 2022, the minimum TLAC requirements will increase to 18% of risk weighted assets  – plusthe combined buffer requirement at that date – and 6.75% of the leverage ratio exposure.38 With a share-based dividend payment option, with a formal commitment by SAS Rue La Boétie to opt for payment in shares, and on the assumptionthat the employee mutual funds (FPCEs) also request the dividend to be paid in shares.34/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020At 31 December 2020, Crédit Agricole Group’s TLAC ratio stood at 25.5% of RWAs and 8.5% of leverage 
ratio  exposure,  excluding  eligible  senior  preferred  debt39.  The  TLAC  ratio  rose  60bp  compared  to  30 
September 2020, hand-in-hand with the first social bond issuance, realised in senior non-preferred format, for €1billion in December, the increase in own funds during the quarter and the low increase in RWAs. Expressed asa  percentage  of  the  leverage  ratio  exposure  (LRE),  the  TLAC  ratio  rose  40bp,  taking  into  account  the 
neutralisation of Central Bank exposures (it would stand at 7.7% before such neutralisation of these exposures).It exceeded the required 19.5% of RWAs (according to CRR2/CRD5, plus, at 31 December 2020, the counter-cyclical buffer of 0.01%) and 6% of the leverage ratio exposure, respectively, despite the fact that it was possibleat that date to include up to 2.5% of RWAs in eligible senior preferred debt.Achievement of the TLAC  ratio is supported by a  TLAC debt issuance program of around €6 billion to €8billion in the wholesale market in 2020. At 31 December 2020, €8.4 billion equivalent had been issued in themarket; the amount of the Crédit Agricole Group senior non-preferred debt taken into account in the computationof the TLAC ratio was €23.9 billion.MRELThe MREL (Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities) ratio is defined in the European “BankRecovery and Resolution Directive” (BRRD). This Directive establishes a framework for the resolution of banks 
throughout the European Union, with the aim to provide resolution authorities with shared instruments and powersto  pre-emptively  tackle  banking  crises,  preserve  financial  stability  and  reduce  taxpayers’  exposure  to  losses.Directive (EU) 2019/879 of 20 May 2019 known as “BRRD2” amended the BRRD and was transposed into Frenchlaw by Order 2020-1636 of 21 December 2020.The MREL ratio corresponds to an own funds and eligible liabilities buffer required to absorb losses in the eventof resolution. The required minimum levels are decisions taken by resolution authorities and then communicatedto each institution, then revised periodically.In 2020, Crédit Agricole Group was notified of the revision of its total consolidated MREL requirement and of anew  subordinated  MREL  requirement  (from  which  senior  debt  are  generally  excluded  in  line  with  the  TLAC 
standards).  These  two  requirements  were  already  met  by  the  Group  at  the  time  of  their  notification.  The  tworequirements were calibrated under BRRD and are applicable until the next notification, which  will include thechanges to the European regulatory framework (i.e. BRRD2).Under BRRD, the MREL ratio is calculated as the  amount of own funds and eligible liabilities expressed  as a 
percentage  of  the  institution’s  total  liabilities  and  own  funds,  after  certain  prudential  adjustments  (TLOF40),  or 
expressed  as  risk  weighted  assets  (RWA).  Regulatory  capital,  as  well  as  subordinated  notes,  senior  non-
preferred debt instruments and certain senior preferred debt instruments with residual maturities of more thanone year are eligible for the numerator of the MREL ratio.Crédit Agricole Group’s target is to reach a subordinated MREL ratio (excluding eligible senior preferred 
debt) of 24-25% of the RWAs by the end of 2022 and to maintain the subordinated MREL ratio above 8%of TLOF. This level would enable recourse to the Single Resolution Fund (subject to the decision of the resolutionauthority)  before  applying  the  bail-in  to  senior  preferred  debt,  creating  an  additional  layer  of  protection  forinvestors in senior preferred debt.39 As part of its annual resolvability assessment, Crédit Agricole Group has chosen to waive the possibility offered by Article 72b(3) of the CapitalRequirements Regulation to use senior preferred debt for compliance with its TLAC requirements in 2021. 
40 TLOF – Total Liabilities Own Funds, equivalent to the prudential balance sheet after netting of derivatives35/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020At 31 December 2020, Crédit Agricole Group posted an estimated MREL ratio 41 of around 11% of the TLOF 
and 8.5% excluding eligible senior preferred debt. Expressed as a percentage of risk weighted assets, the 
Crédit  Agricole Group’s  estimated MREL ratio  was  approximately  33%  at end-December  2020.  It  was  25.5%excluding eligible senior preferred debt.  The MTP target regarding subordinated MREL has been met sinceSeptember 2020.Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) triggerThe  transposition  of  Basel  regulations  into  European  law  (CRD)  introduced  a  restriction  mechanism  for 
distribution that applies to dividends, AT1 instruments and variable compensation. The Maximum DistributableAmount (MDA, the maximum sum a bank is allowed to allocate to distributions) principle aims to place limitationson distributions in the event the latter were to result in non-compliance with combined buffer requirements.The distance to the  MDA trigger  is the lowest of the respective distances to the  SREP requirements in CET1capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital. As from 12 March 2020 and considering the impact of the COVID-19 crisis,the European Central Bank brought forward the effective date of application of Article 104a of CRD5 and allowed 
institutions under its supervision to use Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital to meet the additional Pillar 2 requirement (P2R).Overall, the P2R can now be met with 75% Tier 1 capital including as a minimum 75% CET1 capital. The CET1requirement of Crédit Agricole S.A. and Crédit Agricole Group has thus decreased by -66 basis points since firstquarter 2020.At 31 December 2020, Crédit Agricole Group posted a buffer of 764 basis points above the MDA trigger, i.e.€43 billion in CET1 capital.At 31 December 2020, Crédit Agricole S.A. posted a buffer of 525 basis points above the MDA trigger, i.e.€18 billion in CET1 capital.Crédit Agricole S.A.At  end-December  2020,  Crédit  Agricole  S.A.’s  solvency  remained  at  a high  level,  with  a phased-in  Common 
Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 13.1% (i.e. including the impact of the IFRS 9 phasing-in incorporated in secondquarter 2020 as part of the as part of the “quick fix”), up +0.5 percentage points compared to end-September2020,  5.2 percent  points  above the SREP.  The fully loaded  ratio  is 12.9%.  The  CET1 ratio  benefited  thisquarter from the effect of the stated result, generating a positive impact of +30 basis points, the dividend and AT1distribution :  +5 basis points corresponding to the sum of the  impacts related  to the payment  of a dividend of 
€0.80 per share for financial year 202042 (-27 basis points), to provisions set aside on the basis of the usual pay-
out policy (+34 basis points), and to AT1 coupons (-2 basis points). Risk weighted assets had an upward impacton CET1 amounting to +33 basis points while impact of the methodology and regulatory effects had a negativeimpact amounting -6 basis point, with an impact of the review of internal models (TRIM: -20 basis points), partially 
offset by the favourable impact of new software processing (+14 basis points). Finally, the ratio include a negativeimpact of -7 basis points in the “M&A, OCI & Others” item, notably  due to M&A,  capital increase reserved foremployees (+5 basis points), unrealised gains and/or losses on securities portfolios and foreign exchange impact. 
In the end, Crédit Agricole S.A. had a substantial buffer of 5.2 percentage points between the level of its CET1ratio and the 7.9% SREP requirement, compared with 4.7 percentage points at 30 September 2020. The phased-in leverage ratio was 4.0% at end-December 2020, up +0.4 percentage point from end-September 2020 (up at 
4.2% compared to end-September 2020, before neutralisation of ECB exposures). The phased-in average intra-quarter leverage ratio was 4.0% before the neutralisation of ECB exposures, the phased-in Tier 1 ratio was 14.9%and the phased-in overall ratio was 19.2% this quarter.41 Computation made in accordance with the BRRD applicable to the requirements in force. MREL eligible liabilities issued externally by all Groupentities are included.42 With a share-based dividend payment option, with a formal commitment by SAS Rue La Boétie to opt for payment in shares, and on the assumptionthat the employee mutual funds (FPCEs) also request the dividend to be paid in shares36/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Risk weighted assets amounted to €336 billion at end-December 2020, stable compared to the end-September(-0,5%).  The  business  lines’  contribution  was  negative in the amount of  -€5.6  billion,  (of  which  -€1.9  billion  in 
foreign exchange impact) due to a decrease in risk weighted assets in the Large customers business line (-€4,5billion  excluding  foreign  exchange  impact).  Risk  weighted  assets  in  Retail  banking  decrease  (-€1.2  billionexcluding foreign exchange impact of which -€1.3 billion in CA Italia related to the disposal of NPL). The increase 
in the equity-accounted value of insurance had an upward impact on risk weighted assets in the amount of +€0.5billion.  The  “Methodology  &  regulatory  effects  &  M&A”  item  had  a  upward  impact  on  risk  weighted  assetsamounting to +€5.6 billion, the increase is mainly related to the review of internal models (TRIM: +€5.2 billion).Liquidity and Funding 
Liquidity is measured at Crédit Agricole Group level.In order to provide simple, relevant and auditable information on the Group’s liquidity position, the banking cashbalance sheet’s stable resources surplus is calculated quarterly.The banking cash balance sheet is derived from Crédit Agricole Group’s IFRS financial statements. It is based 
on the definition of a mapping table between the Group’s IFRS financial statements and the sections of the cashbalance sheet as they appear in the next table and whose definition is commonly accepted in the marketplace. Itrelates  to  the  banking  scope,  with  insurance  activities  being  managed  in  accordance  with  their  own  specificprudential constraints.Further  to  the  breakdown  of  the  IFRS  financial  statements  in  the  sections  of  the  cash  balance  sheet,  nettingcalculations are carried out. They relate to certain assets and liabilities that have a symmetrical impact in terms 
of liquidity risk. Deferred taxes, fair value  impacts, collective impairments, short-selling transactions and  otherassets  and  liabilities  were  netted  for  a  total  of  €71  billion  at  end-December  2020.  Similarly,  €96  billion  inrepos/reverse  repos  were  eliminated  insofar  as  these  outstandings  reflect  the  activity  of  the  securities  desk 
carrying out securities borrowing and lending operations that offset each other. Other nettings calculated in orderto  build  the  cash  balance  sheet—for  an  amount  totalling  €169  billion  at  end-December  2020—relate  toderivatives,  margin  calls,  adjustment/settlement/liaison  accounts  and  to  non-liquid  securities  held  by  theCorporate and Investment banking division and are included in the “Customer-related trading assets” section.Note that deposits centralised with Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations are not netted in order to build the cashbalance sheet; the amount of centralised deposits (€65 billion at end-December 2020) is booked to assets under“Customer-related trading assets” and to liabilities under “Customer-related funds”.In  a  final  stage,  other  restatements  reassign  outstandings  that  accounting  standards  allocate  to  one  section,when they are economically related to another. As such, senior issues placed through the banking networks as 
well  as  financing  by  the  European  Investment  Bank,  the  Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations  and  otherrefinancing transactions of the same type backed by customer loans, which accounting standards would classifyas “Medium long-term market funds”, are reclassified as “Customer-related funds”.Note that for central bank refinancing transactions, outstandings related to the T-LTRO (Targeted Longer-TermRefinancing  Operation)  are  included  in  “Long-term  market  funds”.  Indeed,  the  T-LTRO  2  and  T-LTRO  3operations do not allow for early redemption at the ECB’s discretion; given respectively their four-year and three-
year contractual maturity, they are deemed equivalent to long-term secured refinancing, identical in liquidity riskterms to a secured issue.Medium/long-term repos are also included in “Long term market funds”.Finally, the CIB’s counterparties that are banks with which we have a commercial relationship are considered ascustomers in the construction of the cash balance sheet.37/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Standing at €1,500 billion at 31 December 2020, the Group's banking cash balance sheet shows a surplus ofstable  funding  resources  over  stable  application  of  funds  of  €265  billion,  up  €16  billion  compared  toSeptember 2020 and up €139 billion compared to December 2019.In  line  with  initiatives  already  undertaken  during  the  past  quarters  in  connection  with  the  Covid-19  crisis,  theGroup took part in December 2020 once again in the T-LTRO 3 medium-to-long-term refinancing transactions of 
the  European  Central  Bank  for  €10.8  billion,  increasing  its  level  of  stable  resources.  Total  T-LTLRO  3 
outstandings for the Group amounts to €133 billion43 at 31 December 2020. Note that the bonification applicable 
to the refinancing rate for these operations is accrued over the drawdown period and the additional bonificationis accrued over one year, as the Group already meets the lending triggerMoreover, the Group has once again benefited from an increase  of deposit during the quarter, however moremodest. Over the quarter, deposits were up +€10 billion, while loans were up +€7 billion, also contributing to theimprovement of stable resources.The surplus of 265 billion euros, known as “stable resources position”, allows the Group to cover the LCR deficitgenerated by long term assets and stable liabilities (customer, tangible and intangible assets, long-term funds, 
own funds). Internal management excludes the temporary surplus of stable resources provided by the  increasein  T-LTRO  3  oustandings  in  order  to  secure  the  Medium-Term  Plan’s  objective  of  more  than  €100  billion,regardless of the future repayment strategy. The ratio of stable resources over long term applications of fundswas 123.5%, up 1.3pp compared to the previous quarter.Furthermore,  given  the excess  liquidity,  the Group remained in  a short-term  lending  position at  31  December2020 (central bank deposits exceeding the amount of short-term debt).Medium-to-long-term market resources were €321 billion at 31 December 2020, up +€8 billion compared toend-September 2020.They include senior secured debt of €199 billion, senior preferred debt of €79 billion, senior non-preferred debtof €24 billion and Tier 2 securities amounting to €19 billion.The increase in senior secured debt is explained by the Group taking part in the T-LTRO 3 transactions of theEuropean Central Bank.At  31  December  2020,  the Group’s  liquidity  reserves,  at  market  value  and  after  haircuts,  amounted  to 
€438  billion,  up  +€34 billion  from  end-September  2020  and  up  +€140  billion  from  31  December  2019.  Theycovered short-term debt more than four times over (excluding the replacements with Central Banks).The  high  level  of  central  bank  deposits  was  the  result  of  the  replacement  of  significant  excess  liquidity:  they 
amount to €186 billion at December 31,  2020, up +€8 billion compared to end-September 2020 and up  +€80billion compared to end-December 2019. Crédit  Agricole Group  has furthermore pursue  its efforts to increaseimmediate available reserves (after recourse to ECB financing). Eligible central bank assets after haircut amount 
to €102 billion, up +€18 billion compared to end-September 2020 and +€32 billion compared to end-December2019.At end-December 2020, the numerator of the LCR ratio (including the HQLA securities portfolio, cash and central 
bank deposits, excluding mandatory reserves), calculated as an average over 12 months, stood respectively at€314.3 billion for Crédit Agricole Group and at €283.1 billion for Crédit Agricole S.A.  The denominator of the ratio(representing net cash outflows), calculated as an average over 12 months, stood respectively at €211.0 billionfor Crédit Agricole Group and at €191.0 billion for Crédit Agricole S.A.The average LCR ratios over 12 months of Crédit Agricole Group and of Crédit Agricole S.A. stood at respectively149.0%  and  148.2%  at  end-December 2020.  They  exceeded  the  Medium-Term  Plan  target  of  around  110%.43 Excluding Bankoa and FCA Bank38/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Credit Institutions are subject to a threshold for this ratio, set at 100% from 1 January 2018. The end of periodLCR  ratios  at  31  December  2020  are  respectively  178.5%  for  Crédit  Agricole  Group  and  169.4%  for  CréditAgricole S.A.In the context of the COVID-19 health crisis, the increase in the level of LCR ratios of Crédit Agricole Group andCrédit Agricole S.A. was in line with the recourse of the Group to T-LTRO 3 drawings from the central bank.The  Group  continues  to  follow  a  prudent  policy  as  regards  medium-to-long-term  refinancing,  with  a  very 
diversified access to markets in terms of investor base and products.In 2020, the Group’s main issuers raised the equivalent of €31.0 billion44 45 in medium-to-long-term debt 
on the markets, 41% of which was issued by Crédit Agricole S.A. To be noted that:  Crédit Agricole Next Bank (Switzerland) completed an inaugural issue in September of CHF 200 million9-year in Covered bond format ;  Crédit Agricole Assurances (CAA) issued a €1 billion 10-year Tier 2 bond in July to refinance intra-groupsubordinated debt.In addition, €4.4bn was also borrowed from national and supranational organisations  or placed in the Group’sretail banking networks (Regional Banks, LCL, CA Italia) and other external retail networks at end 2020.In  2020,  Crédit Agricole S.A.  completed  105%  of  its  €12  billion  medium-to-long-term  market  funding 
program for the year. The bank raised the equivalent of €12.6 billion44,45, of which €6.2 billion in senior non-
preferred debt and €2.2 billion in Tier 2 debt, as  well  as €4.0 billion  in senior secured debt and €0.2 billion in 
senior  preferred  debt.  The  funding  is  diversified  with  various  formats  and  currencies  (EUR,  USD,  AUD,  JPY, 
CNY, CHF):  The inaugural Social bond issuance in senior non-preferred format of €1bn 7 years in December shouldbe noted.As a reminder, Crédit Agricole S.A. announced in its second quarter 2020 results that the target for senior non-preferred emissions or Tier 2 issues in 2020 had been revised to €6 to 8 billion, up from the initial target of €5 to6 billion.Crédit Agricole S.A. also repurchased €3.4 billion of preferred senior notes denominated in EUR, USD and GBPvia a  public  offer  launched  at  the  end  of  May  2020,  in order  to  optimise its  balance sheet structure and  debtmanagement and to provide liquidity to holders of these bonds.Furthermore, in October 2020 Crédit Agricole S.A. completed a €750 million PNC7.5 AT1 issuance at the initialrate of 4% to allow the Crédit Agricole Group to maintain its high flexibility in the management of its Tier 1 capital. 
The 2021 program is set at €9 billion, including €7 billion of TLAC-eligible debt (non-preferred senior debt or Tier2). At the end January 2021, 29% of the funding plan was realised.44 Gross amount before buy-back and amortisation   
45 Excluding EUR AT1 Issuance39/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Economic and financial environmentOverview of 2020  
The year 2020, initially marked by an orderly slowdown in the global economy, financial markets made to feel 
optimistic by the reduction in uncertainties (including a China-US trade agreement) and lasting accommodative 
monetary  policies,  will  obviously  be  marked  by  the  effects  of  the  COVID-19  epidemic.  COVID-19  is  a  shock 
unprecedented in nature firstly due to its disruption of the real economy: an external event that has impacted the 
economy globally and affects both supply and demand by forcing entire business sectors into inactivity, while at 
the  same  time  causing  consumption  to  contract  with  the  resulting  unintentional  accumulation  of  extensive 
savings. The magnitude of the shock is another point of difference, being much greater than the 2008-2009 crisis. 
As early as April, the IMF thus delivered a forecast of a contraction of world GDP of -3% in 2020 (compared to a 
-0.1%  decline  in  2009).  In  June,  the  IMF  stated  that  it  expected  a  recession  of  -4.9%  in  2020  followed  by  a 
recovery of 5.4% in 2021. In October, the forecasts of a recession followed by global recovery were both slightly 
revised (-4.4% followed 5.2%) to finally be revised favourably in January 2021 (-3.5% and 5.5%).To  cushion  the  anticipated  recession  and  prevent  the  public  health  and  economic  crisis  from  being 
coupled  with  a  financial  crisis,  we  have  thus  witnessed  the  rapid  and  generalised  implementation  of 
monetary  and  budgetary  support  policies  unprecedented  in  terms  of  size  and  capacity  to  overcome 
constraints.  In monetary  matters,  central  banks  have had recourse to diverse  combinations  of  various  tools, 
while  pursuing  similar  targets:  easing  of  financing  conditions,  efficient  transmission  of  monetary  policy,  better 
functioning  of  the  financial  and  credit  markets  and,  in  the  case  of  the  ECB,  easing  of  tensions  on  the  most 
vulnerable sovereign bond spreads in the Eurozone. Thanks to massive support plans (partial unemployment, 
aid to the most vulnerable populations, temporary reduction in social contributions, deferral of tax charges and 
social security costs, public guarantees on loans to companies, government equity investments), the budgetary 
policies have sought to soften the shock by limiting the destruction of jobs and production capacities in order to 
ensure the best possible restart, once the pandemic has passed. While monetary and budgetary policies have 
made it possible to avoid a financial crisis and attenuate the recessionary effect of the pandemic, its effect has 
nonetheless  been  considerable  but  of  varying  magnitude  by  country  depending,  notably,  on  the  countries’ 
structural features (structure of GDP, employment, weight of different sectors), how robust they were pre-crisis, 
their public health strategies and how much leeway they had.In the United States, in mid-March, the Federal Reserve took a series of radical easing measures,46 some 
of which were then extended and supplemented in order to ensure a supply of liquidity to banks and markets 
(unlimited asset buying, expansion of the universe of purchasable securities). This accommodative stance was 
also  reinforced  by  the  adoption  of  average  inflation  targeting  which  explicitly  allows  the  inflation  target  to  be 
exceeded  after  periods  in  which  inflation  has  been  consistently  below  2%.  After  its  December  meeting,  the 
Federal Reserve made it clear that it would maintain an accommodative stance and its key rates at zero for an 
extended period as evidenced by the ‘dot plot’, in which the median projection of members of the FOMC shows 
unchanged rates until at least 2023. While feeling comfortable with the current set up, the Fed has said it was 
ready to do more (more bond purchases and/or maturity extensions) if necessary.The US budgetary response was also rapid (March) and massive, in the form of a support plan known as 
the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (totalling nearly $2,200 billion (i.e.10% of 
GDP) aimed at providing financial assistance or relief to households and businesses, but also to hospitals and 
states. The flagship measures included the direct stimulus payment to low and moderate income households, an 
unemployment insurance assistance plan (authorising the extension of unemployment benefits which normally 
fall under the competence of the states), financial support to SMEs ($350 billion), loans to large corporates, to 
states and local governments ($500 billion), the release of loans to hospitals ($150 billion). An additional budget 
plan ($484 billion i.e. just over 2% of GDP), aimed at strengthening the CARES Act of March and "lengthening" 
the loan program for SMEs, was adopted in April.46 Rate cut of 100 basis points (Fed funds range at [0; 0.25%]) of the marginal lending facility rate (discount window of 1.5% to 0.25%), lower reserve 
requirement  rate,  asset  purchase  program  ($500 billion  in  Treasuries  and  $200 billion  in  mortgage-backed  securities,  MBS),  liquidity  for  specific 
segments (Commercial Paper Funding Facility, Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility), forward guidance (no interest rate hike until the public 
health crisis is overcome and the economy evolves in line with its inflation and employment targets).40/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020In 202047, the US budget deficit therefore widened by nearly 10 points to 14.9% of GDP, while the debt grew by 
+20 percentage points to reach 100% of GDP. Activity nonetheless fluctuated throughout the year. After a decline 
of -1.3% in the first quarter (non-annualised quarterly  change),  the  decline  in GDP in the second  quarter was 
violent (-9%) but followed by a more sustained rebound than expected (+7.5 % in the third quarter). Owing to the 
resurgence of the pandemic, the improvement in the labour market came to a halt in December (after peaking at 
14.8%  in  May,  the  unemployment  rate  reached  6.7%  against  3.5%  before  the  crisis).  In  the  fourth  quarter, 
economic activity grew only +1%. Despite massive monetary and budgetary support, the recession in the 
end stood at -3.5% (-2.5% in 2009); GDP was 2.5% below its pre-crisis level (end of 2019) and inflation 
reached 1.4% at end December.In the Eurozone, from March onwards, the ECB deployed aggressive accommodative measures which it 
then adapted to prevent any undesirable tightening of financial conditions: increase in Quantitative Easing 
(additional  envelope  of  €120 billion),  launch  of  a  new  temporary  purchasing  program  (Pandemic  Emergency 
Purchase Program or PEPP of €750 billion, initially until the end of 2020, purchases not constrained by the limit 
of  holding  no  more  than  33%  of  any  one  bond  or  issuer,  which  makes  for  easier  compliance  with  the  capital 
distribution  key),  introduction  of  transitional  Long  Term  Refinancing  Operations  (LTRO)  until  June  2020  (with 
more favourable conditions as well as less stringent rules for collateral), easing of the TLTRO III conditions, new 
long-term  refinancing  operations  Pandemic  Emergency  Longer-Term  Operations  (PELTRO)  and,  lastly, 
measures to alleviate the solvency and liquidity constraints on the banking sector. At the end of December, faced 
with  the  more  severe  impact  of  the  second  wave  of  the  pandemic  on  the  short-term  scenario  and  the  high 
uncertainties about growth (for which it revised the 2021 forecast downwards from 5% to 3.9%), the ECB sent a 
very clear signal of substantial and, above all, lasting presence; it renewed its incentive to lend to banks and its 
commitment to limit pressure on the risk premiums of vulnerable sovereigns: recalibration of the third series of 
targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III, extension until June 2022 of the period during which very 
favourable  conditions  adopted  in  terms  of  interest  rates48  and  easing  of  collateral  apply),  three  additional 
operations planned for 2021 (June, September, December), increase in the total amount that the counterparties 
will be authorised to borrow during TLTRO III, four additional refinancing operations (PELTRO, from March to 
December  2021  for  a  period  of  one  year),  additional  budget  of  €500 billion  dedicated  to  the  PEPP  (a  total  of 
€1,850 billion), extension of the horizon for net purchases to the end of March 2022, reinvestment of principal 
repayment of maturing securities extended at least until the end of 2023.The Eurozone’s fiscal policy also quickly took an expansionary turn with national measures (support for 
the  healthcare  system,  businesses  and  employment,  public  guarantees  on  new  business  loans).  By  easing 
constraints on national policies through the suspension of budgetary rules, the European Commission enabled 
the countries to respond immediately to the crisis. Faced with such diverse national latitudes that posed the risk 
of a detrimental fragmentation to the market and to the single currency, the pooling of resources was essential. 
The  existing  funds  were  first  mobilised49.  As  the  scale  of  the  crisis  became  clear,  new  pooled  resources 
financed by debt emerged: the SURE fund (support to mitigate unemployment risks, €100 billion), investment 
guarantees by the EIB (€200 billion), a proposal from the European Commission in favour of a recovery and 
reconstruction support fund, redistributing in favour of the poorest countries and those most affected 
by the crisis: the Recovery Fund (i.e. €750 billion raised by bond issue guaranteed by the EU budget).In 2020, the boost to the economy provided by fiscal policy was slightly less than 4 percentage points of GDP on 
average in the Eurozone. Coupled with the cyclical deterioration of the budget balance (4 percentage points of 
GDP), the public deficit widened by almost 9.3% on average in the Eurozone and led to a sharp increase in public 
debt (almost 18 points on average to reach just over 104% of GDP). Despite monetary and fiscal arrangements, 
the economy nonetheless evolved with the pandemic and the mobility restriction measures it imposed. After an 
already  substantial  decline  in  the  first  quarter  (-3.7%  quarter-on-quarter),  GDP  fell  by  -11.7%  in  the  second 
quarter before recording a spectacular rebound that was more robust than expected (+12.5%). In the last quarter, 
the  decline  was  less  severe  than  expected  (-0.7%).  While  inflation  fell  back  (-0.3%,  year-on-year  in 
December;  0.3%  on  average),  the  recession  thus  reached  6.8%  in  2020  (compared  to  -4.5%  in  2009), 
leaving GDP down -5.1% on its level at end 2019 and showing significant differences between the large 
Eurozone countries. For example, in Germany, after almost zero growth in the fourth quarter, GDP recorded an47 2020 fiscal year ended in September. 
48 50 basis points (bp) below the refinancing rate for all outstandings and 50 bp below the deposit rate for any net outstandings equal to the level of 
outstandings granted between October 2020 and December 2021. The precondition for benefiting from this strong incentive to lend is therefore clear: 
the existing support must not be reduced.49 Reorientation of unused cohesion funds from the EU budget in the amount of €37 billion, guarantees to SMEs provided by the European InvestmentBank (EIB), use of funds still available from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) in the amount of €240 billion (or 2% of the area's GDP).41/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020average contraction of 5.3% over 2020, which remains "limited" notably in view of the financial crisis of 2009 (a -
5.7% decline).In France, after a sharp rebound, the lockdown in November led to a smaller-than-expected contraction in GDP 
(-1.3% in the fourth quarter), less than estimated. Over full year 2020, GDP fell by -8.3%, a shock much greater 
than  that  of  the  2009  crisis  (-2.9%),  but  ultimately  lower  than  what  had  been  anticipated  in  the  scenario  of 
December or by the economists ‘scenario which planned a contraction by around 9%. With a less maturity and 
extent, the second lockdown has been less negative for the economy than the spring’s one. Thus, the level of 
activity in the fourth quarter is lower by 5% compared to the fourth quarter 2019, last quarter with a “normal” level 
of activity, whereas the second quarter 2020 was lower by 18.8%. In the fourth quarter, the contraction of activity 
is mainly due to the decline in consumption, caused  by administrative  closures and curfew measures. On the 
other  hand, the  investment continues  its recovery  thanks to the continuation of the activity  in sectors such as 
building, and capital goods production.By posting even moderate growth (around 2.3%), China was ultimately the only G20 economy not to have 
suffered a recession in 2020. After a historically low first quarter, Chinese activity was revived thanks to a policy 
focused on supply (support for companies through public orders and lines of credit). A two-speed recovery has 
thus started with, on the one hand, a V-shaped recovery for industrial production, exports and public investment 
and, on the other hand, a more gradual rebound in consumption, private investment and imports. Despite the 
recovery, almost a year after the public health crisis, some stigmas are still visible: retail sales, just like certain 
service activities (requiring a physical presence) have not caught up to their 2019 level and job creation is still 
insufficient to offset the destruction that took place in early 2020 and absorb new entrants.In 2020, monetary activism made it possible to prevent the economic crisis from being coupled with a 
financial crisis: a clear success in view, on the one hand, of the shock to the real economy and, on the 
other hand, of the threats that hovered at the beginning of the year, particularly within the Eurozone. In 
the wake of a powerful wave of risk aversion, in March, the German ten-year interest rate plunged to -0.86%, a 
low quickly followed by a violent widening of risk premiums paid by the other countries. Risk premiums offered 
by  France,  Spain  and  Italy  peaked  at  66  basis  points  (bp),  147 bp  and  280 bp,  respectively,  in  mid-March. 
Completed  by  the  European  Recovery  Fund,  the  monetary  policy  measures  rolled  out  by  the  ECB  made  it 
possible,  if  not  to  significantly  raise  German  rates,  then  to  avoid  a  fragmentation  of  the  Eurozone  and  to 
encourage the appreciation of the euro against the dollar (9% over the full year). At end December, while the 
Bund stood at -0.57%, French, Italian and Spanish spreads were only 23 bp, 62 bp and 111 bp respectively. US 
rates (10-year US Treasuries), which started from 1.90% at the beginning of the year, fell back to 0.50% in March 
and then moved within a relatively narrow range (0.60%-0.90%). At its 15-16 December meeting, the Fed opted 
for the status quo but confirmed that it was still possible, if necessary, to increase its bond purchases and extend 
their maturity. Rates therefore rose slightly before quickly easing off. Having followed a slow upward trend since 
the summer, rates ended the year at 0.91%. Finally, the abundance of liquidity and the commitment to maintain 
accommodative monetary  conditions provided by  central  banks supported riskier markets. Thus, for example, 
while American and European equities posted declines of respectively -30% and -37% in mid-March compared 
to their level at the beginning of January, they ended the year with a respectable rise (+14%) and a limited decline 
(-6.5%).42/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 20202021 Outlook 
The economic outlook is still clouded by major uncertainties related to problems in exiting the public health crisis 
(persistent  virulence of the pandemic, more contagious virus mutations,  a new  rise in infections,  and ongoing 
uncertainty about whether vaccination will lead to immunity). The profile and pace of growth will therefore continue 
to  be  impacted  by  the  pandemic  and  the  delicate  trade-off  between  growth  and  public  health  safety.  After  a 
lacklustre  first  half,  recovery  should  be  very  modest  and  very  disparate,  despite  monetary  and  budgetary 
infusions.  The  major  economies  will  continue  to  be  helped  out  by  massive  budgetary  support,  highly 
accommodating monetary policies and favourable financial conditions. While some key markers may still fall (as 
in the scenario of negative interest rates in the UK, which cannot be ruled out), it seems that easing exercises 
have  come  to  an  end  (in  the  sense  that  there  will  be  no  new  tools)  and  reliance  will  now  have  to  be  on 
improving/extending existing mechanisms. Budgetary policy will be decisive in delivering short-term support and 
then  stimulating  the  economy  once  the  situation  is  “normalised”.  As  is  being  demonstrated  in  Japan,  where 
monetary innovation seems highly advanced, budgetary policy is playing a more direct role in reducing the output 
gap. This has the support of Bank of Japan, which is acting as an “integrated stabiliser” of long rates by controlling 
the yield curve.In the United States, at a time when the resurgence of the virus poses a risk of sharp deceleration in first half 
2021, the election of Joe Biden as President and the control of both houses of Congress by the Democrats is 
expected to result in additional stimulus measures on top of the $900-billion deal negotiated at the end of 2020. 
In fact, Joe Biden has already proposed a new stimulus bill worth $1.9 trillion. However, political constraints make 
it unlikely that a bill of that size will pass (a stimulus of around $1 trillion is more likely). In January, the Federal 
Reserve, with its wait-and-see attitude, extended its status quo,50 while noting that the economy was slowing, 
that  its  scenario  for  boosting  economic  recovery  in  the  second  half  was  contingent  on  the  progress  of 
immunisation  and  that  rumours  of  tapering  were  premature.  Consequently,  while  budgetary  support  could 
contribute 1 percentage point to US  growth,  growth  will  not  start  to accelerate until  the  second  half,  once the 
vaccine rollout is more widespread and restrictions are eased, at which point it  should be close to 4% (as  an 
annual average).In the Eurozone, uncertainty as to when the pandemic will be under control and the lack of a clear view of the 
economic  situation  will  continue  to  weigh  on  spending  decisions,  both  by  consumers  (risk  of  precautionary 
savings)  and  investors,  throughout  2021.  The  risk  of  a  massive  and  early  withdrawal  of  budgetary  support 
measures seems to be ruled out for 2021: the risk (including of business failures and increased unemployment) 
is expected to materialise later, once business activity begins to return to normal. Our scenario assumes growth 
in 2021 close to 3.8% (with a now-downward bias). Depending on structural characteristics (sectoral composition 
of supply and employment, services weighting, export capacity, adequacy of exported products, etc.) and national 
strategies  (health/economy  trade-offs,  abundance  and  effectiveness  of  support  measures),  there  will  be 
enormous  diversity  in  both  the  impact  of  the crisis  and the speed  and strength  of  the  recovery.  Our  scenario 
assumes  average  growth rates  close to 2.5%  in  Germany,  5.9%  in France  and  4%  in  Italy.  At  end  2021,  the 
Eurozone’s GDP is expected to be 2.4% below its pre-crisis level (i.e. at end 2019). While this gap should be 
limited to 2% in Germany, it is expected to be close to 7.4% in Spain and around 2.2% and 3.9% in France and 
Italy respectively.The announcements made by the ECB in December removed any prospect of normalised monetary policy. The 
ECB has offered reassurance that there will be no early rise in interest rates while additional budgetary efforts 
are being rolled out and guaranteed its presence in the sovereign market until 2023. It is working to maintain the 
credit supply provided in recent months, ensuring banks have favourable conditions. In the medium term, the key 
issues are therefore less about the sustainability of public debt than about governance and the ability to mobilise 
public funds to organise a response to the crisis.The United Kingdom left the single market and customs union on 1 January 2021, with a last-minute free-trade 
agreement. This avoids customs duties and quotas (subject to compliance with fair competition rules and rules 
of origin) but involves significant non-tariff barriers. Frictionless trade in goods and services has therefore come 
to an end, as has the free movement of people. In addition to the disruptions associated with setting up a new 
post-Brexit relationship, there are also the consequences of the pandemic: following a major contraction in 202050 Target range of the Federal funds at 0-0.25%; net purchases of securities at $120 billion per month, i.e. 2/3 Treasury securities and 1/3 MBS; forward 
guidance on key rates consisting of tolerating a “moderate” overshoot of the inflation target for “some time”; forward guidance on asset purchases 
indicating that they will continue at least at the current pace until “substantial progress” is made towards employment and inflation targets.43/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020estimated at -11.1%, growth is expected to be close to 4.5% in 2021, leaving GDP at the end of 2021 3.8% below 
its 2019 pre-crisis level.In emerging markets, after a contraction of just under 3% in 2020, recovery looks to be close to 5.5%. However, 
this figure masks substantial diversity: an optical illusion that conceals both the immediate effects of the crisis, 
mostly the result of monetary and budgetary constraints that are more severe in emerging markets than in the 
developed  world,  and  its  lasting  consequences  in  the  form  of  a  widening  of  the  structural  gap  between  the 
emerging markets in Asia and the others. Asia (particularly North Asia) has suffered less and is getting ready to 
rebound,  led  by  China.  At  the  fifth  plenum,  the  Chinese  authorities  made  public  the  initial  objectives  of  the 
country’s 14th Five-Year Plan. The plan aims for “sound and sustainable development” promoting “quality growth” 
with no formal economic growth target, perhaps to allow for more flexibility in economic policymaking. China is 
expected to rebound strongly in 2021 (+8%) before returning to its projected trajectory in 2022 (+5.1%). However, 
it seems unrealistic to count on China’s momentum to invigorate Asia and promote the recovery of the rest of the 
world given the experience of 2009. With most of the catching-up now done, growth in China has slowed, and 
the country no longer has the means to tow the rest of the world in its wake. And nor does it want to. Its latest 
so-called “dual circulation” strategy, aimed at limiting its dependence on overseas markets, is proof of this.A  slow,  uncertain  and  probably  chaotic  recovery,  multiple  uncertainties  and  monetary  easing  are  all 
conditions conducive to maintaining extremely low interest rates. It will be necessary to wait until favourable 
news finally emerges, in terms of public health as well as the economy, before recovery can start to take shape 
– a start limited by the absence of inflation and excess capacity. In the meantime, progress made by the Eurozone 
can be judged by past interest rate changes: clear solidarity has avoided fragmentation, risk premiums paid by 
the  so-called  “peripheral”  countries  have  been  tightened,  and  the  euro  has  put  in  a  solid  performance.  Our 
scenario therefore assumes US and German 10-year sovereign rates of close to 1.50% and -0.40% respectively 
at end 2021, coupled with spreads of 20 basis points (bp), 50 bp and 100 bp above the Bund for France, Spain 
and Italy where it is assumed that political tensions will ease.In  keeping  with  a  scenario  where  recovery  might  even  be  slow,  timid  and  unsynchronised,  the  dollar 
could depreciate very slightly against the euro and currencies that are more procyclical or driven by risk 
appetite. The dollar's depreciation would, however, be tempered by the resurgence of Sino-American tensions 
that  weigh on Asian currencies in particular: the current crisis has only temporarily  overshadowed the  dissent 
between  the  United  States  and  China.  While  the  timetable  is  uncertain  (the  US  still  has  to  install  the  new 
administration,  manage  its  domestic  problems  and  rebuild  its  global  alliances),  and  despite  the  fact  that  Joe 
Biden’s presidency augurs a change in tone, the roots of the conflict remain. The rise of protectionism and political 
risk  hampered  hyper-globalisation:  the  crisis  should  favour  greater  regionalisation  of  growth  centres,  as 
evidenced by the signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership uniting China, ASEAN member 
countries and key US allies (Australia, South Korea, Japan and New Zealand).44/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Risk factors of Crédit Agricole S.A.The main risks to which Crédit Agricole S.A. and the Crédit Agricole Group are exposed are set out respectivelyon pages 123 to 134 and 135 to 147 of Amendment A03 to the 2019 Universal Registration Document.In Amendment A04 to the Universal Registration Document 2019 pertaining to risk factors to which Crédit Agricole 
S.A. is exposed, risk factor A 4. a) “The ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may negatively affect thebusiness, operations and financial performance of Crédit Agricole S.A.” is presented page 125 :a)  “The  ongoing  coronavirus  (COVID-19)  pandemic  may  negatively  affect  the  business,  operations  andfinancial performance of Crédit Agricole S.A.In  December  2019,  a  new  coronavirus  strain  (COVID-19)  appeared  in  China.  The  virus  has  spread  to  many 
countries around the  world, leading the World Health  Organisation to describe  the situation as  a pandemic inMarch  2020.  The  pandemic  has  had  and  is  expected  to  continue  to  have  significant  negative  impacts  on  theworld economy and financial markets.The spread of COVID-19 and resulting government controls and travel bans implemented around the world havecaused disruption to global supply chains and economic activity. The outbreak has led to supply and demandshocks,  resulting  in  a marked  slowdown  in  economic  activity,  due to the  impact  of  containment  measures  on 
consumption, as well as production difficulties, supply chain disruptions and a slowdown of investment. Financialmarkets have been significantly impacted, with increased volatility, stock market indexes declining precipitously,falls in commodity prices and credit spreads widening for many borrowers and issuers. The extent of the adverse 
impact of the pandemic on the global economy and markets over the long term will depend, in part, on its lengthand severity, and on the impact of governmental measures taken to limit the spread of the virus and its impacton the economy.  In this respect, in December 2020, the French Ministry of Economy and Finance revised itsGDP growth forecasts for 2021 downwards to +5.0% versus +7.4% as previously announced.The pandemic and its impact on the global economy and financial markets have had and are likely to continue tohave a material adverse impact on the results of the divisions and the financial position of Crédit Agricole S.A. 
This impact included and is likely to include in the future (1) a deterioration in the Crédit Agricole Group’s liquidity(which impacts its Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)) due to various factors including in particular increased drawingby corporate customers on liquidity lines (up to 32% at end-April 2020), (2) a decline in revenue due in particular 
to (a) reduced production in activities such as home loans and consumer finance, (b) lower asset managementinflows and banking and insurance fees and commissions and hence lower revenues from fees and commissionsand (c) lower revenues in asset management and insurance, (3) a higher cost of risk resulting from a deterioration 
in the macroeconomic outlook, the granting of moratoria and, more generally, the deterioration in the repaymentcapacity of corporates and consumers, (4) an increased risk of a ratings downgrade following the sector reviewsof  certain  rating  agencies  and  following  internal  reviews  of  Crédit Agricole S.A.  models  and  (5)  higher  Risk 
Weighted Assets (RWAs) due to the deterioration of risk parameters, which in turn could affect Crédit AgricoleS.A.’s capital position (including its solvency ratio).The health crisis and its effect on the economy in France, Europe and internationally have had a major impact 
on the levels of activity of the various business lines of the Group. In the course of 2020, several lockdowns havebeen imposed in several countries around the world, particularly in France and Italy, Crédit Agricole Group’s twomain domestic markets, with the following consequences: (1) Retail banking activities were strongly impacted by 
the imposed lockdown. Consequently, French retail banking housing loans in 2020 reached 96% of the businessin 2019, and at CA Italia 102% of 2019. Similarly, 2020 consumer credit business of CA Consumer Finance wasat 86% of 2019, and CAL&F's leasing was 98% of its 2019 level; (2) Insurance activities were also impacted by 
the  lockdown.  In  relation  to  the  risk-aversion  by  savers  due  to  the  volatility  of  the  financial  markets,  total  netinflows  were  +€1.0 billion,  versus  +€9.5 billion  in 2019, and new non-life insurance business in 2020 reached45/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 202091% of new businesses recorded in 2019; (3) Clients drew heavily on credit lines with drawdown rates of up to32% during the second quarter of 2020, although these drawdowns slowed down at the end of June 2020.The cost of risk had been affected by the deterioration in the repayment capabilities of corporates (weakenedcompanies,  fraud  revealed  by  the  crisis)  and  consumers,  the  rating  downgrades  of  counterparties  whoseoutstanding move from “Stage 1” to “Stage 2”, and in particular the sensitivity of some industries (i) related to 
restrictions  on  movement  or  gatherings  of  people, for  aeronautics,  tourism,  hotels,  restaurants,  cruises,  or  (ii)whose demand levels were below normal, such as the automotive and shipbuilding industries, or lastly, (iii) thatremain weak due to the weight of the global recession on demand in the distribution of non-food goods, and Oil 
&  Gas  sectors.  In  addition,  the  commercial  real  estate  sector  is  a  sector  to  watch,  as  the  health  crisis  hasaccelerated pre-existing threats in some segments, such as shopping malls being hurt by online shopping andthe office segment facing structural change if teleworking trends continue. At 31 December 2020, Crédit Agricole 
S.A. exposures to sectors considered “sensitive” were as follows: (a) aeronautics with €16.1 billion in Exposure 
at Default (EAD)51, of which  6.4% in default, (b) tourism, hotels, restaurants  with €7.6 billion in EAD, of  which 
3.7%  in  default,  (c)  the  distribution  of  non-food  goods  with  €13.0  billion  in  EAD,  of  which  3.7%  in  default, (d) 
automotive, with €22.5 billion in EAD, of which 0.8% in default, (e) Shipping with €13.0 billion in EAD of which4.6% in default, and (f) Oil & Gas with €22.7 billion in EAD, of which 2.3% in default. These sectors have beensubject to additional provisions to take their increased sensitivity into account. In the fourth quarter of 2020 the 
economic  scenarios,  revised  downwards  compared  to  the  third  quarter  of  2020,  also  generated  an  additionalburden of Stage 1 and Stage 2 cost of risk, due in particular to deteriorated GDP growth forecasts for 2021.As a result, the underlying results for 2020 amounted to €3,849 million, down -16.0% compared to 2019. This is 
mainly  explained  by  the  increase  in  cost  of  risk  reaching  €2,606  million  at  the  end  of  2020,  +€1,350  millioncompared to 2019.The health crisis had a greater impact during the lockdown periods in France and Italy during the second and 
fourth quarters. In the second quarter:  (1) new home loans were down in the second quarter of 2020 at LCL (-9.8% compared to second quarter of 2019) and stable at CA Italia (-0.8%). Similarly, new consumer finance atCrédit Agricole Consumer Finance was down -40% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter 
of 2019. CAL&F also recorded a decline in new leasing business of  -23.9%; (2) Insurance activities were alsoimpacted by the lockdown. Total net inflows were negative at -€0.9 billion in second quarter 2020 and Property& Casualty insurance revenues were slightly down by -0.9% in second quarter 2020 compared to second quarter 
2019; (3) Corporate and Institutional activities remained dynamic in the second quarter of 2020, but customersdrew heavily on credit lines.In the  fourth quarter  of  2020,  the new  lockdown  imposed  in France  and  in  various  European  countries,  while 
having a less significant impact on the economy, had the following consequences for Crédit Agricole S.A. in thefourth quarter of 2020:(1) retail banking activities were affected throughout the new business of new loans to individuals (notably home 
loans and consumer finance). At LCL and Regional Banks, new housing loans in the fourth quarter of 2020 werestable reaching 104% of the production recorded over the same period in  2019. But at CACF, new consumerfinance loans during the fourth quarter 2020 represented 97% of the production recorded during the fourth quarter 
2019.  CAL&F  also recorded a  stable  leasing  production  during the fourth  quarter  2020  reaching  101%  of  theproduction of the fourth quarter of 2019.(2) Inflows in the insurance sectors remained stable, totalling +€1.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 comparedwith +€1.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019.Uncertainties continue to weigh on developments in the health situation in Europe, with the introduction of new 
restrictive measures in France and other European countries (curfews, closing of borders, lockdowns) and the51 Exposure at default: this is Crédit Agricole SA’s exposure should the counterparty default. The EAD includes on- and off-balance sheet exposures. Off-balance sheet 
exposures are converted into balance sheet equivalents using internal or regulatory conversion factors (draw-down scenarios).46/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020emergence of variants of the virus. Additional measures are therefore likely to be imposed,  depending on theevolution of the pandemic. Although vaccines were announced at the end of 2020 and several countries have 
begun their phased roll-out, the timing of these roll-outs also remains highly uncertain, leading to uncertaintiesabout  the  pace  of  recovery  from  the  crisis.  Lastly,  there  exists  a  considerable  uncertainty  about  the  pace  ofchange and the rate at which states (particularly the French and Italian states) and central banks (particularly theEuropean Central Bank) will implement measures to support the economy.Lastly,  in terms  of  solvency,  the main impacts  of the  crisis  on  the  CET1 ratio of  Crédit  Agricole  S.A.  were,  inaddition  to  a  more  modest  level  of  retained  earnings,  an  increase  in  risk-weighted  assets  due  to  rating 
downgrades, mainly in Corporate and Investment Banking (€5.4 billion in 2020). The fully loaded CET1 ratio ofCrédit Agricole S.A. at 31 March thus deteriorated (11.4%, versus 12.1% at 31 December 2020) and 30 June2020 (11.7%) before recovering at 30 September 2020 (12.4%) and at 31 December 2020 (12.9%). This increase 
does not predict the level the CET1 ratio will reach in the coming quarters. More specifically, there still remainsa high uncertainty regarding the unemployment rate, the use of accumulated savings, the health scenario andthe timetable for implementing and halting public measures and, more generally, about the consequences of anychanges in economic activity on retained earnings, risk weighted assets and regulatory decisions.47/63PRESS RELEASE - 4th quarter 2020Risk factors of Crédit Agricole GroupThe main risks to which Crédit Agricole S.A. and the Crédit Agricole Group are exposed are set out respectivelyon pages 123 to 134 and 135 to 147 of Amendment A03 to the 2019 Universal Registration Document.In Amendment A04 to the Universal Registration Document 2019 pertaining to risk factors to which Group Crédit

NAV per share is net equity Group share restated fromAT1 issues divided by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the period.Net tangible assets per share is tangible net equity Group share, i.e. restated for intangible assets and goodwill,divided by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the period.NBV Net Book ValueNet  book  value  is  net  equity  Group  share,  restated  for  AT1  issues,  HTCS  hidden  reserves  and  proposeddividends on annual earnings.EPS Earnings Per ShareNet income Group share (excluding AT1 issues interests) divided by the average number of shares outstanding,excluding  Treasury  shares.  EPS  indicates  the  portion  of  profits  attributable  to  each  share  (not  the  portion  of 
earnings  paid  out  to  each  shareholder,  which  is  the  dividend).  It  may  decrease,  assuming  net  income  Groupshare remains unchanged, if the number of shares increases (see Dilution).Cost/income ratioThe  cost/income  ratio  is  calculated  by  dividing  expenses  by  revenues,  indicating  the  proportion  of  revenuesneeded to cover expenses.Cost of risk/outstandingsCalculated by dividing the cost of risk (over four quarters on a rolling basis) by outstandings (over an average ofthe past four quarters, beginning of the period). The cost of risk on outstandings can also be calculated by dividingthe annualised cost of risk of the quarter by the outstandings as of beginning of the period.Since the first quarter 2019, loans outstanding considered are only loans to customers, before impairmentImpaired loans ratioThis ratio compares the gross impaired customer loans to total gross customer loans outstanding.Coverage ratioThis ratio compares the total loans loss reserves to the gross impaired customer loans outstanding.Net income Group share attributable to ordinary shares – statedThe net income attributable to equity attributable to ordinary equity corresponds to the group share of which theinterest on the AT1 debt has been deducted, including the pre-tax issue costsUnderlying net income Group shareUnderlying net income Group share is calculated as net income Group share restated for specific items (i.e. non-recurring or exceptional items).ROE Return on EquityIndicator measuring the return on equity, calculated by dividing a company’s net income by its equity.RoTE Return on Tangible EquityMeasures the return on tangible equity (the bank’s net assets restated to eliminate intangibles and goodwill).61/63PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter 2020Disclaimer
