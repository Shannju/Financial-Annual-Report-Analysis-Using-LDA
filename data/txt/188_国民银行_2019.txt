financial innovation and broaden the scope of its business presence 
with an aim to secure sustainable future growth engines.CEO Message011Dear esteemed customers, shareholders and investors!I would like to begin by extending my heartfelt gratitude for the 
unwavering trust and support you have provided to KB Financial 
Group.Throughout 2019 we have faced a difficult business environment 
that continues to be characterized by weak economic growth 
and lingering uncertainties in global financial markets. Despite 
such challenging conditions, we have channeled our group-wide 
resources to drive financial innovation and expand the scope of 
our businesses.In the past year, we became the nation’s first financial institution 
to launch an MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) service. 
In successfully launching our MVNO services, “Liiv M”, we were 
able to strengthen our digital capabilities by creating a platform 
that combines finance with telecommunication technology. In 
addition, we have introduced new services and products to meet 
the challenges presented by Korea’s rapidly aging society and the 
growing demand of our customers for services after retirement. 
For example, we have opened senior care and assisted living 
facilities in urban areas that offer premium services similar to 
those in advanced nations.Our investment banking business has also been significantly 
enhanced with the acquisition of the Financial Services 
Commission’s mega investment banking license, allowing us to 
issue promissory notes with greater leverage and thus improving 
our funding capabilities.Behind our improved performance is the 
unfailing support of our customers and 
shareholders and the firm commitment of 
our employees. Each and every one of us 
at KB Financial Group will do our utmost 
to progress even further through sustained 
transformation and innovation.On the global business front, we have expanded our network 
in Southeast Asia. Following our acquisition of shares in Bank 
Bukopin of Indonesia in 2018, we have acquired shares of 
PRASAC Microfinance Limited, a leading provider of microfinance 
and deposit-taking services in Cambodia. We have also acquired 
major stakes in PT. Finansia Multi Finance and Sunindo Primasura 
Finance in Indonesia. In established capital markets such as 
London, Hong Kong, and New York, we have made significant 
strides in solidifying our IB business network.In our continuing efforts to reinvent our branch banking network 
we have successfully implemented a broad foundation for our 
“PG 2.0” project, our transformation to a branch network that 
is more optimized than ever before in meeting the demands 
of each local community. We have also improved the services 
of our digital channels by introducing new platforms in auto 
financing and unsecured loans. Internally, we have completed 
various projects such as implementing next-generation digital 
systems, introducing digital procedures to our traditional branch 
operations and developing new and efficient HR systems. In 
undertaking these digital initiatives, we are highly confident that 
we will remain a leading financial services provider in an ever-
changing and competitive environment.012KB Financial Group Annual Report 2019Now I would like to briefly review our financial performance in 
2019.In 2019, KB Financial Group posted KRW 3,311.8 billion in net 
profits. This is an increase of KRW 250.6 billion from the previous 
year, primarily attributable to interest income from solid loan 
growth as well as improvements in non-interest income, 
increased operational efficiencies and good asset quality 
performance.Total assets of the Group increased by KRW 39.0 trillion from the 
previous year to KRW 518.5 trillion. Loans showed well-balanced 
growth with increases in key household products and to prime 
customers in SOHO and SME. In our efforts to diversify our 
sources of income, we also expanded our investment portfolio in 
securities.Our improved financial performance, highlighted by expansion 
in our net profit and total assets, is a result made possible by the 
unfailing support from our customers and shareholders, as well 
as the strong commitment shown by our employees. Each and 
every one of us at KB Financial Group will maintain our strong 
dedication to innovation and continue to deliver sustainable 
progress.We continue to face mounting concerns over the global 
economy and growing volatility in global financial markets. As 
forecasted by many, we expect the Korean banking sector to be 
challenged by low interest rates, low growth and low inflation. 
There is also the ongoing competition from tech giants who are 
advancing into the financial industry on the back of their digital 
platforms.In overcoming these challenges and emerging as a genuine 
leader in the financial services industry, we at KB Financial Group 
have created the acronym ‘L.E.A.D.’ as our strategic blueprint 
to guide our journey in 2020. As we aspire to be the life-long 
financial partner deeply trusted by our customers for our market 
leadership and unrivaled services, we vow to focus our group-
wide capabilities on the following initiatives.First, we will “level up” the core competitiveedge of KB Financial Group to establish a morerobust and efficient business model.We will strengthen our core competitiveness to generate solid 
income contribution from our main subsidiaries and key business 
areas. In facing an economic environment that continues to be 
slow in growth, we will innovate our cost structure and reinforce 
our crisis management system to readily address potential crisis 
situations both in Korea and abroad.Second, we will expand our business territoryand markets through strategic M&As, bothat home and abroad, to strengthen and diversifyour business portfolio and secure new growthmomentum.Our ‘Two Track’ strategy of pursuing expansion in Southeast Asia 
and advanced markets will continue. In addition, we will continue 
our efforts to discover new opportunities, such as in My Data and 
MVNO, to promote sustainable future growth.CEO Message013KB Financial Group created the acronym   
 - L.E.A.D – as our strategic blueprint to 
guide our journey in 2020 to become the 
life-long financial partner deeply trusted 
by customers for our dominant market 
leadership and unrivaled services.Fourth, we will pursue customer-centric“digital innovation” to improve the customerexperience in our digital channels.As we continue to diversify and widen the reach of our digital 
platforms and channels through expanded digital marketing, 
we will build our seamless digital network by drawing on internal 
as well as external data to provide customized services to our 
customers.Through KB Innovation Hub Center, we also plan to expand our 
strategic partnerships with start-ups and fintech companies to 
create KB’s own digital ecosystem.With many uncertainties surrounding the economy and 
our industry we are expecting many challenges in the year 
ahead. Even so, we at KB Financial Group are determined to 
collectively overcome these challenges, setting us apart from 
the competition and reinforcing our status as a leading financial 
group dedicated to Innovation driven growth.We look forward to your continued support for KB Financial 
Group and we wish you and your loved ones good health and 
happiness.Thank you.Jong Kyoo Yoon

This was mainly driven by the solid growth in net interest income and net 
fee & commission income maintaining robust fundamentals even amid the economic slowdown. KB Financial Group’s top priority for 2019 was to 
focus on asset quality and profitability, which prompted our endeavors to pursue quality loan growth, manage our net interest margin, and improve 
performance in our non-interest income. This, in return, allowed us to maintain highly steadfast fundamentals in generating income. KB Financial 
Group’s credit cost ratio recorded to 0.20% in 2019 which remained subnormal level attributable to quality-driven loan growth and preemptive risk 
management. As of the end of 2019, the group BIS ratio and CET1 ratio posted 14.5% and 13.6% respectively demonstrating the highest level of 
capital strength in the Korean financial industry.By subsidiary, KB Kookmin Bank recorded KRW 2,439.1 billion in net income, KB Securities KRW 257.9 billion, KB Insurance KRW 234.3 billion, and KB 
Kookmin Card KRW 316.6 billion, which account for 98.1% of the group total income. Overall improvement in performance was witnessed in other 
subsidiaries as well, with KB Asset Management posting KRW 48.9 billion in net income, KB Capital KRW 117.0 billion, KB Life Insurance KRW 16.0 
billion, KB Real Estate Trust KRW 61.7 billion, and KB Savings Bank KRW 16.3 billion.As we move into 2020, KB Financial Group will further strengthen its core business competitive edge and pursue bold customer-centric innovation in

Changes – Happier Life & Better World” to embody its firm commitment 
to leveraging finance to assist customers in designing a more flourishing 
future and to bring greater convenience and progress to the world. Its 
vision “Driven by world-class talents and bold innovation, to become 
your trusted financial partner for a lifetime” will guide the group’s 
endeavors to become a lifelong financial group by leading innovation 
that shifts the financial paradigm with best professionals. With prompt 
decision-making and agile executional capabilities, we relentlessly 
pursue innovation to provide differentiated products and services that 
will ultimately solidify our position as the most trusted and recognized 
leading financial group.2019 Key Activities and AchievementsBusiness Unit System for organizational operation  
to increase group-wide collaborative synergy 
Following the expansion of the Business Unit from the three units 
of WM, CIB, Capital Market to seven with the addition of Digital 
Transformation, Retail Customer, SME, and Insurance in 2019, Global 
Business Unit was newly created in 2020. This helped boost our 
execution of global business operations, thus increasing the number of 
units under this operational system to a total of eight. Our employees 
are also allowed to hold additional positions in related subsidiary 
organizations as a way to increase synergy from respective Business 
Units through the ‘One-Firm’ approach and improve management 
accountability. Going forward, KB Financial Group will reinforce the 
Business Unit System to maximize synergy among subsidiaries and 
promote efficiency in organizational operation.Balanced growth and synergy generation between  
banking & non-banking business 
Over the past four years, we have leveraged M&As in securities, insurance 
and capital operations, which were traditionally the weaker components 
of our business portfolio, to reinforce our non-banking business and 
realign our business portfolio. This brought our net income ratio between 
banking and non-banking business from 8:2 to 7:3. Our mid to long-term 
goal is to eventually reach 6:4 to secure sustainable growth momentum 
by enhancing the inherent competitiveness of respective subsidiaries and 
strengthening our non-banking business through M&As.Broader global business presence and stronger competitiveness
Our global business approach takes into account a range of factors, 
from country-specific regulatory conditions, demographic structures, 
and financial industry infrastructure to developmental characteristics of 
respective financial sectors and the growing overseas investment needs of 
domestic investors, and is focused on the four areas of CIB, retail banking, 
digital business, and asset management. Our recent advancement into the 
digital banking, auto finance, MFI, and securities business in Cambodia, 
Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam has allowed us to develop our understanding 
of and experience in these Southeast Asian markets. To effectively use our 
business resources, a limited number of countries will be selected as hub 
candidates and nurtured as new ‘Mother Markets’.As part of this strategy, we acquired a 70% stake in PRASAC Micro 
Finance, Cambodia’s largest Microfinance Deposit-taking Institution 
(MDI), in December 2019. With a local business network of 11 locations, 
PRASAC has an unrivaled market dominance in the Cambodian market 
as the third largest lender in the local financial market while posting 
high profitability with KRW 90.7 billion in net income and 29.4% in ROE 
as of 2018. KB Financial Group’s post-acquisition plan is to share its 
exceptional retail capabilities with PRASAC while retaining its core 
competitive edge  at the maximum possible level and swiftly transform 
PRASAC into a commercial bank. PRASAC could then go on to become 
an unrivaled leading bank in Cambodia, which will surely lay the basis 
for KB Financial Group to expand its global  business presence across 
the entire Southeast Asian region.Management Strategy to Achieve  
Goals of 2020In line with mounting concerns over the global economic recession and 
continued uncertainties in the global financial market, the domestic 
economy is expected to suffer low interest rates, low growth, and low 
inflation for an extended period of time. This is further aggravated by 
the emergence of new competitors and threats, ranging from the full-
fledged implementation of open banking to tech giants advancing into 
the financial industry with their powerful platforms.To evolve into a true “Leader” who reliably pioneers the market as 
Korea’s top-notch financial group even in the most trying of times , KB 
Financial Group determined the management keyword “L.E.A.D.” as the 
strategy direction to guide its journey in 2020, and will focus group-
wide capabilities to become a trusted financial partner for a lifetime, 
known for its market leadership and unrivaled service.L
        Level Up the Core
First, we will “level-up” our core competitive edge to establish a 
robust and efficient business model.Our core competitiveness will be strengthened to generate solid profits 
from main subsidiaries and key business areas. In preparation for an 
era of continued low growth, our cost structure will be strategically 
innovated and our response system will be reinforced to readily address 
any possible situation both in Korea and abroad.E
        Expansion of the Territory 
Second, we will further complete our business portfolio through  
strategic M&As both at home and abroad, and secure growth 
momentum in line with changing business conditions.A range of M&A opportunities will be actively reviewed and 
implemented to bolster our business portfolio while the ‘Two-Track’ 
strategy will be executed to advance into Southeast Asian and mature 
markets to broaden our global business presence. Furthermore, My 
Data, MVNO and other new business opportunities will be extensively 
explored to generate future sustainable growth.Vision & Strategy021A
         Active & Creative KB
Third, we will ramp up our pace of transformation and innovation 
to establish an organizational culture befitting the title of Active & 
Creative KB.A corporate culture that values creativity and equality will be developed 
to enable prompt decision-making and execution. We will also establish 
an ESG management system on par with global standards to serve as 
a leader in fulfilling corporate social responsibility and creating future 
value.D
         Digital Innovation Customer-Centric
Fourth, we will provide customer-centric digital innovation to deliver 
a differentiated user experience and value.Our customer contact points will continue to strengthen through 
diversified channels and broader digital marketing activities. A wide 
array of channels will be aligned to reinforce our seamless service 
delivery system while refined analysis of internal/external data will 
be performed to offer personalized products and services. With 
the KB Innovation HUB Center playing a pivotal role, we will expand 
our strategic partnership with fintech companies to create a digital 
ecosystem where KB services are situated at the hub.Group Corporate Structure (As of March.31, 2020)Risk Management CommitteeEvaluation and CompensationCommitteeNon- executive Director

responding to the rapidly-shifting financial landscape in an aim to efficiently support its mid to long-term strategy and business 
decision-making.Risk Governance
The Risk Management Committee is mandated to set risk management 
strategies, determine acceptable levels of risk appetite, review the 
status of group-wide risk management, and approve the application of 
risk management systems, methodologies and major improvements.The Risk Management Council consists of Risk Management Officers 
from the holding company and subsidiaries, and is responsible for 
deliberating on the matters delegated by the Risk Management 
Committee and consulting on detailed risk management issues.The Risk Management Department of the holding company monitors 
and manages the status of group-wide risk operations and the limits of 
internal capital by developing risk management policies and operating 
relevant processes.Credit Risk Management
KB Financial Group defines credit risks as expected and unexpected 
losses that may occur due to the default or declining creditworthiness 
of the counterparty.Credit Policy Direction
KB Financial Group develops credit policies in consideration of the 
economic outlook, business conditions, asset quality trends, and risk 
management capabilities, and operates sector-specific loan policies 
accordingly in household, corporate, and credit card sectors. Theprimary goal of its credit policy is to maintain asset quality and minimize 
mid to long-term credit cost volatility in order to maximize the value of 
KB Financial Group.Credit Risk Measurement & Management
To measure credit risks related to Capital at Risk or CaR concerning 
on/off balance sheet assets, KB Financial Group takes the Internal 
Ratings Based Approach developed in compliance with supervisory 
standards. CaR calculated as such refers to the maximum possible 
losses from business operations that may arise at a certain confidence 
level due to changes in creditworthiness of the borrower or 
counterparty. Our CaR calculations reflect any possibility of insolvency 
on the part of the borrower, possible losses and remaining maturity 
of exposure, and economic correlations. Furthermore, we identify, 
measure and monitor credit concentration risks that may additionally 
occur due to the disproportionate focus on specific borrowers or 
sectors within the group-level portfolio.Total Exposure Limit Management
KB Financial Group’s Total Exposure Limit Management System 
aims to prevent excessive risk exposure and risk concentration in 
specific sectors and optimize the credit portfolio through stable asset 
management. The Risk Management Department of the holding 
company is responsible for periodically monitoring our total exposure 
limit and reporting outcomes to the Risk Management Committee.Risk Management OrganizationKB Kookmin BankKB SecuritiesKB InsuranceKB Kookmin CardKB Asset ManagementKB CapitalRisk Management CommitteeSet risk appetite & internal capital limitsDevelop group-level risk policiesRisk Management CouncilConsult on the matters delegated by the 
Risk Management Committee and pendingrisk management issuesRisk Management DepartmentsKB Life InsuranceKB Real Estate TrustKB Savings BankKB InvestmentKB Data SystemsKB Credit Information028Market Risk Management
KB Financial Group defines market risks as possible losses from its 
trading positions in line with interest rates, exchange rates, stock prices 
and other market fluctuations, and identifies, measures, monitors, 
controls and reports such market risks inherent in bonds, foreign 
currencies, securities, and derivatives. Serving as an indicator to 
quantify the risks inherent in trading accounts, Market VaR(Value at 
Risk) refers to the maximum possible losses that may occur within a 
certain period of time at a certain confidence level. Our subsidiaries 
that operate trading accounts verify the adequacy of our VaR model 
through the daily comparative analyses performed on actual and virtual 
profits/losses and VaR calculations. For assets or subsidiaries to which 
this model is not applicable, KB Financial Group utilizes its standard 
methodology in compliance with supervisory regulations to manage 
market risks.Interest Rate Risk Management
We defines interest rate risks as possible decreases in net asset value 
or Net Interest Income(NII) attributable to unfavorable fluctuations 
in market rates. The goal of interest rate risk management is to 
comprehensively manage our assets and liabilities to maximize our net 
interest income within the acceptable risk range while minimizing any 
losses in net interest margins that may occur due to changing interest 
rates.Liquidity Risk Management
We defines liquidity risks as risks that may arise due to maturity 
mismatches or any failure to respond to unexpected demand and 
supply of funds. A systemic approach is taken to manage liquidity risks 
to meet the demand for cash outflows – deposit withdrawals, the 
pending maturity of financial bonds, and the repayment of borrowings 
– while securing liquidity for asset management including lending and 
bond investments.Operational Risk Management
We defines operational risks as any and all financial and non-financial 
risks that may negatively impact its capital management through 
business operations. Our operational risk management aims to satisfy 
the regulatory purposes of supervising authorities and to disseminate 
a risk management culture across the board through strengthened 
internal controls and improved processes.Internal Capital Management 
Internal capital is required to prevent economic insolvency caused by 
unexpected losses at the target confidence level. KB Financial Group 
manages group-wide capital adequacy by measuring, allocating, 
and managing the internal capital of respective subsidiaries. The 
Risk Management Committee sets group-level risk appetite and 
then allocates internal capital by risk type and subsidiary while each 
subsidiary conducts business within the allocated capital limit.Stress Testing 
Stress tests are performed to analyze the potential vulnerabilities 
of our portfolio and develop countermeasures accordingly under 
possible scenarios created based on economic forecasts. KB Financial 
Group conducts such tests at least semi-annually and sometimes 
more frequently by reflecting economic cycles and prospects in order 
to analyze how its operations may be impacted by abrupt changes 
across the business landscape and to respond to them proactively. Test 
results are reported to the top management and the Risk Management 
Committee to help set group-wide risk appetite and limits and promote 
the decision-making process.Basel III Internal Ratings Based Approach for  
Group Credit Risk Management 
Following the introduction of the Basel III framework by the Korean 
Financial Services Commission, KB Financial Group fully prepared 
the development of the necessary human/physical infrastructure 
to address such regulatory changes and has adopted these Basel 
standards in calculating its risk-weighted assets and capital adequacy 
ratios since December of 2013.To elevate the level of risk management across subsidiaries, we 
developed the group-level, single model-based Internal Ratings Based 
Approach approved by the Korean Financial Supervisory Services 
through rigorous assessments, which has been under operation since 
the end of 2016 to calculate group-wide BIS ratios.This approach is expected to further advance KB Financial Group’s risk 
management system spanning from risk management methodology 
and system development to data management and control structure, 
and establish a risk management culture in addition to improving its 
capital adequacy, which will in turn strengthen its risk management 
performance, increase global creditworthiness, and enhance the 
quality of its business operations across the board.2020 Risk Management Directions 
With escalating possibilities of a prolonged global economic slowdown, 
the domestic economy is also forecast to suffer a continued downturn 
cycle caused by structural factors that perpetuate low growth. Our 
awareness of these deteriorating conditions at home and abroad and 
their resulting potential risks that may threat our endeavors to improve 
soundness and profitability as a financial institution, helps our risk 
management focus on minimizing such risks.As such, KB Financial Group will strengthen the monitoring of 
subsidiaries so that they maintain their asset quality at the highest 
possible level among industry peers while promoting proactive risk 
management of respective subsidiaries concerning volatility in interest 
rates, exchange rates, stock prices and other market factors to fully 
address uncertainties in the market. Our risk management will also 
be further enhanced through proactive response to and monitoring 
of subsidiaries advancing into the global market and launching new 
businesses.Risk Management029Emerging Risk Management 
KB Financial Group defines emerging risks as possible upcoming risks posed by economic, environmental, and social changes which may 
have a grave long-term impact on its business operations, and takes proactive countermeasures to reduce such risks. Primary emerging risks 
that we identified include “demographic changes caused by low birth rates and aging populations” and “changes in our way of conducting 
business driven by the innovation of digital finance”. The following illustrates the detailed definition of these risks, their long-term impact on 
our business, and our countermeasures.Demographic changes  
caused by low birth rates  
and aging populationsEmerging RisksChange in our wayof conducting business  
driven by the innovationof digital financePopulation  aging  and  other  demographic  changes  are 
expected to cause decreases in savings rates and in income 
levels as elderly borrowers become economically inactive, 
which will ultimately deteriorate our asset quality.While financial institutions may create innovation-driven growth oppor-
tunities through new technology and financial innovation, they may 
fail to swiftly respond to such changes or be left behind while facing 
increasing risks in relation to IT, information protection and fraud that 
may arise with emerging new technology and innovative finance.Impact on BusinessesThe asset quality analyses performed on household credit 
loan borrowers by age group demonstrate that asset quality 
deteriorates with age.New  technology  or  new  finance  driven  by  digital  financial 
innovation  is  widely  penetrating  the  entire  value  chain  of  the 
traditional  financial  business  to  change  the  way  we  conduct 
business and create new business models, products and services.Risk Reduction CountermeasuresAs  the  average  age  of  borrowers  in  our  loan  portfolio  is 
forecast  to  increase  to  face  a  high  probability  of  income 
reduction, we are proactively refining our risk management 
process  in  preparation  for  any  decline  in  asset  quality 
caused by the decreasing income levels of the elderly (e.g. 
operating credit guidelines that consider borrowers’ income 
and debt burden levels by life cycle stage)We are taking a stronger proactive risk management approach 
by  intensively  analyzing  and  identifying  potential  risks  and 
developing  countermeasures  in  preparation  for  the  emergence 
of new risks from digital financial innovation while fully utilizing 
new technology from big data to machine learning in improving 
our risk management infrastructure in order to elevate our core 
competitive edge in risk management.030Synergy CreationKB Financial Group is wholeheartedly committed to further improving the intrinsic competitive edge of respective subsidiaries, 
maximizing synergy through organic collaboration and delivering differentiated and unique comprehensive one-stop services. 
In 2019, we took a broad range of actions to efficiently create synergistic effects in order to practice customer-oriented 
management.Group Synergy Strategy
KB Financial Group’s synergy strategy aims to strengthen its competitive 
edge under the One-Firm philosophy to build a group structural 
competitive advantage. To this end, we are taking a multi-faceted 
approach to advancing our One-Firm culture by developing customer-
centric processes to enrich customer experiences, reinforcing 
integrated group-level marketing, and facilitating referral sales across 
subsidiaries. In 2020, we will identify new business areas on the basis 
of organic collaboration among subsidiaries, develop integrated 
group-wide services, and strengthen the seamless alignment between 
face-to-face and non-face-to-face channels to continue with our 
endeavors to build a stronger synergistic edge.Building Customer-centric Processes to Enrich 
Customer Experience 
KB Financial Group enabled customers to purchase the core services 
of multiple subsidiaries through connected non-face-to-face channels 
and developed one-stop processes to deliver its financial products, 
which ultimately improved customer convenience and their product 
purchase ratio. Our ‘Star Banking’ app allows customers to open their 
bank account and be issued credit and check cards simultaneously, and 
our ‘Startable’ app ensures that customers who open their securities 
account can also apply for card issuance at the same time. This has 
undoubtedly helped subsidiaries broaden their non-face-to-face 
product sales channels.Furthermore, we opened the ‘KB Easy Loan’ service that allows 
customers to use the ‘Liiv Mate’ app to check their credit loan limits 
and interest rates simultaneously and even receive recommendations 
for tailored products and take out loans accordingly across the four 
banking, credit card, capital, and savings bank subsidiaries. This service 
diversified our product line-up to cater to wide-ranging customers 
from those with excellent credit scores to those with mid-to-low scores 
while streamlining the customer document submission process and 
adopting a user-centric UI/UX to improve customer convenience. The 
‘KB Car Easy Integrated Limit Check’ service was also launched to assist 
customers in purchasing our products with greater convenience: using 
our used car trading platform ‘KB Cha Cha Cha’, customers can check 
their auto loan limits and interest rates, and apply for membership 
cards and car insurance plans across the three banking, credit card, and 
capital subsidiaries.Launching Diverse Products and Services to  
Generate Synergy 
Our wide-ranging package products aim to swiftly respond to 
the shifting domestic/global financial landscape represented bydemographic shifts and financial consumer behaviors. These products 
also work to deliver financial products and services that cater to 
diversifying customer needs. By launching a total of four package 
products, including a package that emphasizes the social trends of 
‘women, retirees, and the environment’ and ‘BTS Collaboration’ that 
targets youth customers, we strive to elevate KB Financial Group’s 
One-Firm brand and strengthen customer relationships.Notably, our Environmental Keeper Action package designed to reflect 
social concerns over increasing Micro dust issues exceeded 300,000 
in the number of accounts sold for nine months, and donations 
were made to help with urban forestation. Our KBXBTS Package 
Ⅱ(installment savings and check card), created through collaboration 
with the world-acclaimed boy band BTS to build our own youth 
customer base, posted nearly 100,000 in the number of purchases inNumber of Group Customer34,822 thousandReach a total of 34,822 thousand of customers as aresult of commitment to customer-centric managementbased on synergy creation within the GroupOne-stop Process DevelopmentKB Easy LoanProvide one-stop access to diverse auto financingproducts within KB Financial GroupSynergy Creation031just four months following its release. KB Financial Group intends to 
gather customer feedback through market research and KB Tribunus 
Plebis to develop group-level package products that meet financial 
needs in a more refined manner.Strengthening Integrated Group-level Marketing 
Since we became the first financial institution to establish a joint 
advertisement process among subsidiaries, we launched another joint 
mobile advertisement campaign through social network channels 
to continue with our efforts to strengthen integrated group-level 
marketing. TVs, digital windows and ATMs installed at our bank 
branches that are easily accessible by our customers will readily provide 
information on the products and services offered by our securities 
and insurance subsidiaries to further broaden synergistic activities 
undertaken among subsidiaries.Furthermore, we became the first Korean financial holding company 
to create promotional contents that publicize the features provided by 
the major mobile apps of five of our subsidiaries – KB Kookmin Bank’s 
Liiv Talk Talk, KB Securities’ M-able, KB Insurance’s Mobile Direct, KB 
Kookmin Card’s Liiv Mate, and KB Capital’s KB ChaChaCha – in order to 
produce a joint video commercial available on social network channels. 
The commercial presented a single story that illustrated how to use the 
respective apps provided by five subsidiaries, and its script was written 
in a movie scenario format in order to increase viewer ratings. This 
video commercial received a total of 2.41 million views  of Youtube, as 
of December 2019, and contributed to solidifying our corporate image 
as a youthful and vibrant business that is willing to pursue change and 
try something new.Facilitating Referral Sales and Disseminating  
the One-Firm Culture 
As a way to facilitate referral sales, we migrated subsidiary-specific 
synergy management systems into an online version to improve 
the convenience of field sales operations, and expanded employee 
exchange programs across subsidiaries to further disseminate our 
One-Firm culture. Notably, the recently renewed group-wide ‘Synergy 
Performance Management System(2.0)’ was customized with an aim to 
increase employee convenience: the system makes it easier to identify 
and manage employees’ synergy activities and utilizes a digital window 
to streamline the process to request referral sales consent, laying the 
basis to promote referral sales among subsidiaries.In addition, ‘Department Head Community’ and ‘Synergy RM Workshop’ 
are operated to promote interactions among employees across 
subsidiaries and share major issues related to synergy creation, paving 
the way for subsidiaries to collaborate on key group-wide initiatives.Number of Active Cross-selling Customers10,283 thousandReach 10,283 thousand of cross-subsidiarycustomers, up by 333 thousand from the previous yearto significantly expand the customer baseCross-selling Ratio in 201945.8%Ratio of customers who use products and servicesof more than two main subsidiariesNumber of WM Multi-service Branches70Broaden the WM coveragebetween banking and securitiesWMNumber of CIB Multi-service Branches9Improve bank-securities sales efficiency in servingSME customers at CIB centers – creating synergy amongsubsidiaries032Digital FinanceKB Financial Group takes a customer-centric approach in its pursuit of digital innovation. In November 2019, KB Financial 
Group became the first-ever financial institution to launch its hybrid service dubbed “Liiv M” that combines finance with 
telecommunication, demonstrating its full commitment to broadening KB’s financial ecosystem and developing a differentiated 
competitive edge.Delivering an innovative customer experience through non-
face-to-face channels from the customer-centric standpoint 
KB Financial Group continues to advance its major platform apps – KB 
Star Banking, Liiv, Liiv ON/Liiv Mate/KB Cha Cha Cha – by improving 
their UX/UI for increased customer convenience. Notably, the ‘Open 
Banking’ service, which allows customers to register their accounts 
at other banks for account checks, transfers and other financial 
transactions, was adopted for our Star Banking, internet banking, Liiv, 
and Liiv Talk Talk. The KB My Money was further upgraded to help 
respond to the shifting data industry landscape and to strengthen our 
competitive edge as an asset manager. Furthermore, our AI-based 
customer counseling chatbot service was launched to improve user 
experiences from financial business counseling to financial term 
explanations and product recommendations.To deliver a fresh new and convenient user experience in mobile financial 
transactions, we unveiled the “KB Mobile Certificate” which enables 
customers to log in and use their e-signatures without cumbersome 
physical security measures such security cards or OTPs. The KB Mobile 
Certificate proved to be an extraordinary success, surpassing 2.5 million 
users in just six months following its release in July 2019. This new 
certificate system is set to extend its application from our banking to 
other subsidiaries in the insurance, card, and securities businesses.Pursuing diverse financial innovation through deregulatory 
opportunities allowed within the financial regulatory sandbox 
Fully utilizing the financial regulatory sandbox provided by the Korean 
government, we advanced into the telecommunications business last 
November, becoming the first Korean financial institution to make 
such a move, and launched an MVNO based hybrid service dubbed 
“Liiv M” that combines finance with telecommunications. This service 
is expected to create new added value through the abundant data 
generated both from telecommunications and financial industries.In addition, KB Financial Group made 18 applications to create 
innovative financial services in accordance with the financial regulatory 
sandbox, and three of them were approved including KB Kookmin 
Card’s ‘online safe payment service based on credit card points’. In 
2020, we plan to make 12 additional applications to continue our 
pursuit of financial innovation.Laying the basis for a KB-driven digital ecosystem through 
proactive collaboration with external tech players
KB Financial Group is reinforcing the competitive edge of its digital 
platform through collaboration with wide-ranging tech players. More 
than 373 open APIs were developed to support the seamless alignment 
between our financial services and external platforms, and CLAYON, 
a cloud-based innovation platform, was further advanced to pave the 
way to create a wide array of financial services in the cloud. Specifically, 
CLAYON became the first in the financial industry to pass the safety 
test performed on cloud service businesses. This helped to showcase 
its achievement in building a stable financial cloud environment that 
will promote external collaboration. We also upgraded our non-
face-to-face log collection system to strengthen our customer 
behavior analytics as a way to facilitate external collaboration and the 
development of data-enabled digital financial services.In January 2019, KB Financial Group and LG Group signed an agreement 
to conduct joint business on the basis of new digital technology: KB’s bank 
accounts were connected with the blockchain-based local currency pilot 
service launched within the LG Science Park in Magok, Seoul, to create 
a platform that allows for real-time charging, payment, and settlement 
through block sharing with KB blockchain. This was followed by the signing 
of MOUs with such diverse IT companies as SK C&C, Atomrigs Lab, and 
Microsoft to develop AI, blockchain and cloud technology.Furthermore, KB Finnacial Group operates the ‘KB Innovation HUB’ to 
identify and support startups with high growth potential. Since its launch 
in March 2015, the KB Innovation HUB has selected high-tech startups 
as ‘KB Starters’ for their endeavors to create innovative services, andNumber of Mobile Certificate Users2.5+ millionSurpass 2.5 million of users

Financial Group subsidiaries. As tangible outcomes were achieved through 
this initiative over the years, the number of KB Starters reached 76, the 
cumulative number of partnerships amounted to 113, and investments 
made through CVC funds and others were valued at nearly KRW 33 billion. 
In July 2019, the KB Starters became the first in the Korean financial 
industry to partner with the global accelerator PLUG & PLAY(PNP) to 
advance into the global market. As such, KB Financial Group continues 
to support innovative businesses so that promising high-tech startups in 
Korea can go global and evolve into unicorn companies.Strengthening core capabilities to advance digital transformation 
To swiftly reflect varying customer needs, KB Financial Group is 
pursuing innovation in the way it conducts business. Diverse devicesare used to digitalize teller operations while an AI-enabled chatbot 
counseling service was introduced to offer easily accessible and 
convenient 24/7 counseling in a bid to improve work efficiency and 
provide high-quality financial counseling to customers. Furthermore, 
the adoption of Robotics Process Automation(RPA) was expanded to 
address simple and repetitive processes within subsidiaries, which saved 
a total of 754,623 hours of work during 2019.Wide-ranging training programs were provided to assist employees in 
strengthening their digital competency across all digital-related areas, 
from digital and IT to data and information protection. The ‘KB Digital 
Finance ACE Academy’, and ‘Blockchain Expert Training Course’ were 
operated to secure a core digital workforce, and the recruitment of 
professionals was increased in the areas of new technology(blockchain, 
AI, etc.) and app design & planning.Major Applications of KB Financial GroupKB Kookmin BankKB Star BankingProvide full banking services to retail customersLlivLiiv Talk TalkKB Star AlarmProvide convenient financial services including currency exchange and remittanceProvide interactive banking and messenger servicesProvide financial information notificationsKB Real Estate Liiv ONProvide real estate information and relevant specialized servicesKB My MoneyProvide integrated mobile asset management servicesKB Star Corporate BankingProvide banking services to corporate customers including fund and payment

D.N.A(Digital Native Alliance)’ and ‘KB Digital Customer Advisors’. The 
KB D.N.A program allowed us to partner with SOPT, an undergraduate 
IT startup club, to identify a total of 33 necessary improvements on our 
major mobile platforms and improve their UX/UI by taking into account 
the preferences and feedback from the Digital Native generation.Undertaking the K Project to develop our next-generation 
computing system 
The K Project was designed to develop a next-generation computing 
system and thus assist KB Financial Group in successfully pursuing digital 
transformation. Its ultimate goal is to create an innovative IT infrastructure 
that combines Artificial Intelligence and big data with the cloud and other 
latest technologies. This project is taking a phased-in approach across six 
areas – marketing hubs, mobile channel, call center system, data hub, and 
global platform redevelopment – along with 75 subprojects. Starting with 
a preliminary opening at all banking branches in Korea in February 2020, 
this project is set for completion by October 2020.Work is currently underway to improve the function and design 
of integrated terminal screens across branches and increase their 
system stability, build an advanced platform that supports segmented 
marketing to meet diverse customer needs, and replace aging 
infrastructure to elevate the operational efficiency of the IT system. 
In addition, our big data platform is being upgraded to maximize data 
quality and the use of analytical data, and our global system is being 
renovated to establish a digital banking support system.Building an integrated KB IT center 
July 2019 marked the completion of KB Kookmin Bank’s KB 
Integrated IT Center. This center represents the concentration of all 
IT infrastructure and technology that have been distributed across 
respective KB Financial Group subsidiaries in the banking, securities, 
insurance, and card business, and is expected to play a pivotal role in 
conducting core digital business at the group level. The KB Integrated 
IT Center is recognized as the financial industry’s top-notch “Green 
Data Center” equipped with global-level safety, scalability, efficiencyKB Kookmin Card’s Data Sales PerformanceKRW1.5billionFacilitate data open lab business to raise its salesperformance from KRW 252 million in 2018 toKRW 1.5 billion in 2019and security. Its safety was further improved with the adoption of an 
earthquake-resistant design; the center is powered by renewable 
energy including photovoltaics and fuel cells; and uninterrupted 
power supply, biometric access control, and purpose-specific network 
separation contributed to establishing a stable network system.Refining marketing campaigns through big data analytics 
In 2019, a total of 674 ‘Smart Offering Service’ campaigns were launched 
and a total of 2.8 million cases of real-time marketing activities were 
undertaken on the basis of our refined big data generated through the 
latest data processing technology and our real-time analytics system. 
Moreover, personalized customer offerings were made available by 
increasing the use of such data as customer behavior logs and customer/
product similarities and by elaborating on our product recommendation 
model through machine learning-based analytics/application.Facilitating and advancing the “Data Open Lab” business 
To facilitate KB Kookmin Card’s Data Open Lab business, a target 
marketing and advertisement service business model was developed 
on the basis of payment data in order to diversify our efforts to identify 
corporate consumers of such data. This resulted in an increase of KRW 
1.5 billion in data sales in 2019, from KRW 252 million in 2018. Intensive 
promotion of the card data business aligned with the Data Open Lab 
also helped increase the number of affiliated business partners from 
nine in December 2018 to 50 in 2019.Plans in 2020
In 2020, the financial infrastructure will be fully open, in line with the 
expansion of open banking services and other financial technologies, 
and the introduction of ‘My Data’ business spurred by the passing of 
three major data regulations in Korea. The advancement of Naver, 
KaKao, Toss and other tech businesses into the financial industry is also 
set to further intensify competition. Amid such challenging conditions, 
KB Financial Group will leverage its solid customer base and unrivaled 
digital core competitiveness to deliver differentiated financial products 
and services and to pursue ‘customer-centric digital finance’.Efficiently responding to open banking, My Data, and other 
deregulatory trends 
Our response to open banking will be to strengthen core services 
and streamline our UX/UI for customers. As to My Data business 
introduced as a result of the promulgation of three major data 
regulations in February 2020, we intend to take a subsidiary-specific 
customized strategy by offering tailor-made products and services 
and differentiating platform contents. As data utilization will constitute 
one of the key competitive components for any financial institution, 
KB Financial Group plans to help revitalize the data economy and 
improve its core competitive edge to strengthen the value chain. We 
will simultaneously pursue proactive convergence with data from other 
industries including retail, telecommunications, and healthcare to 
develop innovative products and services and build a comprehensive 
financial platform that supports customers in every area of their life.Digital Finance035Cloud-enabled KB Digital InfrastructureStar CMSAffiliatesGalaxy

We will further refine our customer targeting through the combination 
of our structured or non-structured data to broaden real-time tailor-
made customer marketing. To this end, we plan to build a data analytics 
platform and perform big data analyses through wide-ranging channels 
in order to create new added value. A data governance system will 
be developed to improve data user convenience, and the use of data 
assets will be upgraded through improved accessibility. Customer Mind 
Research that uses search data will be conducted to plan personalized 
contents and identify new contents based on the intention of potential 
customers, and a KB data collaborative platform will be created as a 
new type of data-enabled collaboration system. By fully implementing 
‘Liiv M’, our MVNO-based finance-telecommunication hybrid service 
unveiled in the 2nd half of 2019, we plan to secure new customers and 
differentiate our platform service. Furthermore, we will strengthen the 
group-level alignment of financial products and services and leverage 
the KB Mobile Certificate and USIM to reinforce the connection of 
mobile platforms across subsidiaries.Using digital technology to improve efficiency 
We will continue to identify the new applications of RPA while 
combining RPA with wide-ranging digital technologies to improve work 
efficiency. The Integration of RPA with AI and other digital technologies 
will help extend the scope of RPA introduction and automate front 
office operations. Meanwhile, The K project will enable us to deliver 
an innovative experience to customers and efficient work conditions 
for employees. To flexibly respond to the rapidly-shifting financial 
landscape, we plan to establish a horizontal and efficient corporate 
culture and strengthen internal training to develop a professional IT 
technology workforce.Furthermore, cloud, blockchain and other varying digital technologies 
will be combined to facilitate open innovation and push the boundary 
of financial services. CLAYON will be equipped with a multi-cloud 
architecture structure through our contract with AWS and other global 
cloud service providers to improve its performance while reinforcing its 
stability.036Global BusinessKB Financial Group takes a multi-faceted approach to strengthen 
its global business capability and position. We leverage the assets 
owned by respective subsidiaries and the business capabilities we 
have developed in retail banking and other diverse areas while 
comprehensively considering new types of market entry made available 
with the development of digital technology in order to broaden our 
global business presence in a way that suits country-specific market 
conditions.Over the years, KB Financial Group has advanced into digital banking, 
auto financing, MFI, and securities businesses in Cambodia, Laos, 
Myanmar, Vietnam, and Indonesia to further understand and 
experience these Southeast Asian markets. While we strike the right 
balance between organic growth based on our existing network 
and inorganic growth promoted through subsidiary-level M&As to 
effectively use our resources, we also focus on a limited number of hub 
candidates, rather than multiple countries, to transform these target 
countries into our ‘Mother Markets’. In parallel, we also opened IB Units 
in Hong Kong, London and New York as our regional IB operation hub 
to broaden our business line-up in mature markets and explore diverse 
global market entry options. As such, we follow a two-track strategy to 
tap into both emerging and advanced markets.In October 2019, KB Financial Group signed an MOU to form a strategic 
alliance with Stifel Financial, a U.S.-based firm with multiple subsidiaries 
in the securities, banking, and asset management businesses, to 
promote mutual investment cooperation. This will serve to develop a 
close collaboration system in each other’s business areas – CIB, WM,and asset management – and jointly explore diverse collaborative and 
new business opportunities. Starting with U.S. stock brokerage and 
research that draws growing interest from domestic institutional and 
retail customers, our collaboration will extend its scope into other 
areas including but not limited to IB deals, financial investment product 
sourcing, and PI investments.In January  2020, KB Kookmin Bank signed a stock purchase agreement 
to acquire a 70% stake in PRASAC Microfinance, Cambodia’s largest 
Microfinance Deposit-taking Institution(MDI). With a local network 
of 117 locations, PRASAC represents the nation’s largest MDI and is 
ranked third in loan market share. KB Kookmin Bank plans to transform 
PRASAC into a commercial bank to transfer its exceptional retail 
capabilities and help PRASAC evolve into a leading bank in Cambodia in 
order to broaden its business presence in Southeast Asia.KB Kookmin Bank’s Hanoi Office in Vietnam and its Gurugram Office in 
India were transformed into branches following the preliminary approval 
granted from the local financial authorities, and initiated their operation 
in February 2019. Specifically, we are keeping an eye on the Indian 
market as India is home to the world’s second largest population, is 
posting continued high economic growth in the 7% range, and is rapidly 
growing its trade with Korea, and we plan to continuously expand our 
branch network in the country to accelerate our advancement into the 
Indian market.KB Securities’ local Vietnamese subsidiary KB Securities Vietnam(KBSV)

agreement to acquire an 80% stake in ‘PT Finansia Multi Finance’, 
a local Indonesian credit finance company conducting business in 
auto, motorbike, and durable goods installment financing in Jakarta, 
Indonesia. KB Kookmin Card plans to expand installment financing 
products that cater to local customer needs to focus on high-quality 
assets while partnering with local mobile platform operators to expand 
digitally-based non-face-to-face operational channels.In February 2019, KB Capital signed an agreement to acquire an 85% 
stake in ‘PT Sunindo Parama Finance’ in Indonesia. This will enable 
KB Capital to expand its installment finance business from new car 
purchases into used cars and consumer goods as well as the car rental 
business.Plans in 2020
To expand its global business presence, KB Financial Group will follow 
a two-track strategy to focus on ‘Southeast Asia expected to achieve 
high growth’ and ‘U.S. and other advanced markets known for their 
high investment stability and favored by Korean customers as an 
overseas investment destination’.In Southeast Asia, we will target Vietnam, a country posting rapid 
economic growth and attracting numerous Korean businesses, 
Indonesia, the region’s largest market, and the three countries of 
Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos situated along the Mekong River. To 
broaden our global business in these countries, we will continue with 
M&As on the subsidiary level and pursue the organic growth of the 
existing network.In the U.S. and other mature markets, our market entry and expansion 
strategy will focus on ‘securing stable growth drivers across the group 
portfolio’ and ‘developing global capabilities in the WM/CIB/asset 
management sectors’.Global Business StrategyORGANICINORGANICKB network expansionM&AsKB MFI

KB Insurance 3040ESG ManagementIn pursuit of responsible finance that cares for the environment and society, KB Financial Group adopted ESG standards across 
the entire business conduct to establish and operate a sustainability management system. We have set the three key strategic 
directions of promoting ESG-based innovative growth for sustainable finance, advancing our climate change strategy for the 
environment, and internalizing accountability management, and are committed to fulfilling our role as a financial leader in ESG 
management both in Korea and abroad.Strengthening global ESG leadership by proactively endorsing 
international initiatives 
KB Financial Group is committed to fulfilling its leading role in ESG by 
proactively joining global initiatives and international organizations. 
In September 2019, we signed up for ‘The Principles for Responsible 
Banking’ of the UNEP Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), which were presented 
to the banking industry to reach the social goals set under the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement.We are the only Korean financial business to join the ‘UNEP Collective 
Commitment to Climate Action’ which, as a follow-up implementation 
program for the signatories to the above-mentioned principles, was 
attended by 31 institutions to take climate-friendly actions by reducing 
carbon-intensive business in corporate operations while increasing the 
ratio of green business. In addition to the UNEP FI, we are also actively 
participating in the UN Global Compact, Carbon Disclosure Project, 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and other global 
initiatives on sustainability management. We have also recently assisted 
in the development of the UNEP FI and EU Taxonomy guidelines for 
banks designed to adopt a global green investment classification 
system in performing banking credit reviews.Pursuing sustainable finance by playing a leading role in the 
ESG financial market 
KB Financial Group is an active player in undertaking renewable energy 
projects, and is working to make our society greener. Since 2007, we 
have served as a financial advisor and syndicated loan underwriter on 
wide-ranging renewable energy projects including photovoltaics, wind, 
and fuel cells. As a leading financial institution in the renewable energy 
sector, we were chosen as a financial advisor and lead arranger for 
such large-scale renewable power generation projects as Jeju Hanlim 
offshore wind, Solaseado photovoltaics, Yeongam PV Power Plant, and 
Incheon fuel cell power generation.KB Securities created a blind fund with a Canadian investment and 
management company with expertise in the resource and energy 
sector and is conducting a PV power generation business following the 
acquisition of the required business license. KB Asset Management 
has increased its renewable energy investments since 2007 to surpass 
KRW 1 trillion in cumulative investments in the offshore PV, biogas and 
PV-connected energy storage system business while investing in the 
overseas PV power generation business and actively advancing into the 
global market to diversify its investment destinations.Furthermore, we officially endorsed the Women’s Empowerment 
Principles (WEPs) to create a corporate culture that respects gender 
equality, inclusiveness and diversity.As climate change, ranging from global warming to Microdust issues, is 
exerting an even greater impact on our life today, KB Financial Group is 
developing a range of green financial instruments.Leading ESG-driven Sustainability Management12Promote ESG-based innovative

while donating a portion of the profits to green growth associations, 
green loan products such as energy use rationalization funds and 
environmental industry promotion funds, and ‘Preferential Loans for PV 
Power Plant Businesses’ eligible for green power generators.KB Kookmin Card’s Green Card allows consumers who purchase eco-
friendly products to accumulate eco-money points as a way to pursue 
green finance. KB Life Insurance developed the Environmental Love 
Hospitalization Plan (non-participating term insurance) that covers 
hospitalization caused by diseases stemming from the environment. 
KB Insurance included special provisions that offer discounts on 
the use of public transportation, low mileage and the consumption 
of green automobile parts. KB Asset Management delivers diverse 
funds that support the growth of the  domestic and international 
renewable energy industry to expand group-wide green business 
investments while practicing eco-friendly management by launching 
sustainable finance products, taking the lead in improving corporate 
competitiveness and fulfilling social responsibility.KB Kookmin Bank established a sustainable finance management 
system to strengthen its support for eco-friendly and socially-
responsible business. Not only does this system comply with the 
‘Sustainability Bond Guideline’ developed by the International 
Capital Market Association, but also is recognized for its excellence 
as demonstrated by the evaluation report prepared by the world-
renowned ESG financial consulting firm ‘Sustainalytics’. KB Kookmin 
Bank became the first-ever Korean commercial bank to issue 
sustainability bonds in October 2018, and then successfully priced a 
sustainability subordinated bond offering in February 2019.This issuance garnered much attention from investors and overseas 
media outlets as the bank became Asia’s first to offer such sustainability 
subordinated bonds. Their proceeds were used to finance qualified 
investment projects and extend loans designed to assist socially-
vulnerable groups and create jobs for these individuals, develop 
renewable energy, and support the environmental improvement 
business.Elevating our reputation as a corporate leader through 
strategic response to international sustainability management 
assessments 
KB Financial Group was included in the ‘DJSI World Index’, the global-
level index among the Dow Jones Sustainability Index family, for four 
consecutive years in recognition of its strong commitment to fulfilling 
ESG responsibility. The DJSI is globally accepted for its credibility in 
evaluating corporate sustainability management performance, and theindex family consists of DJSI World as the highest level index, DJSI Asia 
Pacific, DJSI Korea, and others.Furthermore, we obtained ‘leadership A-‘ in the ‘Climate Change 
2019’ published by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) known for its 
credibility in the environmental sector. Through sustained commitment 
to gender equality, we became the first Korean business to be listed 
on the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for two consecutive years 
for our efforts in building a corporate culture that promotes gender 
equality through female leadership and talent development.In Korea, we were granted an overall A+ in the ‘2019 ESG Evaluation 
by the Korea Corporate Governance Service’, which shows that 
our top-notch performance in sustainability management is widely 
acknowledged both internally and externally.Publishing the 2018 KB Financial Group Sustainability Report  
KB Financial Group ensures efficient communication on its sustainability 
management capabilities through the disclosure of key material issues 
and management data. KB Financial Group publishes sustainability 
reports by reflecting the outcomes of surveys conducted on internal/
external stakeholders concerning wide-ranging sustainability 
management issues as well as those material issues identified through 
the materiality test.Notably, the 2018 KB Financial Group Sustainability Report illustrated 
material issues on customers, innovation, environment, social 
responsibility, and employees, its sustainability management system 
spanning governance, business ethics, integrated risk management, 
and human rights management, and its sustainability management 
achievements in relation to customers, local communities, 
environment, employees and economy. In so doing, we disclose our 
performance in the areas of management, environment, safety, and 
society to strengthen our communication with investors, shareholders, 
customers and other stakeholders and earn their trust.DJSI World Index 
Listed for4 Consecutive YearsGained global top-level recognition in risk management, 
customer relationship management, inclusive finance,and anti-financial crime policy042Adopting the Stewardship Code to enhance our corporate 
value and investor benefits
KB Financial Group adopted the Stewardship Code as part of its 
fiduciary duty policy for the six major subsidiaries of KB Kookmin Bank, 
KB Securities, KB Insurance, KB Life Insurance, KB Asset Management, 
and KB Investment. This allows us to reflect non-financial ESG 
components as well as financial ones in measuring corporate value in 
order to strengthen our role as a fiduciary in inducing the growth of our 
investees and increasing mid to long-term returns on customer assets. 
Furthermore, we developed our conflicts of interest policy to prevent 
the occurrence of such conflicts in fulfilling our fiduciary duty while 
implementing internal control regulations and compliance manuals to 
uphold the principle that investor interests take precedence over the 
interests of KB Financial Group, its shareholders and employees and 
that the mutual interests of investors should be equally addressed. In 
faithfully performing our fiduciary duty as a shareholder, we make our 
voices heard in business conduct and facilitate the maximization of 
shareholder interests while ensuring the robust operation of market 
surveillance mechanisms. In so doing, we help change corporate 
governance for the better and increase corporate value, ultimately 
advancing the rights and interests of our customers.Asia’s FirstUSD 450 millionKB Kookmin Bank placing Asia’s first USD 450 millionforeign currency-denominated subordinatedsustainability bonds (Feb. 2019)ESG Strategy Directions in 2020

Since the establishment of the holding company in 2008, KB Financial 
Group has consistently launched social contribution programs to 
lay the basis for children and teens to grow into healthy members of 
society, and is taking the lead to support multicultural groups to bring 
inclusiveness and diversity to our society.We signed a business agreement with the Ministry of Education in 2018 
to help ‘fill the void of care’, a chronic and challenging social issue,as one of our key focus areas in fostering future generations. Under 
this agreement, we will provide a total of KRW 75 billion by 2022 to 
establish and expand elementary afterschool care spaces and national 
kindergartens situated next to elementary school. Our assistance 
allowed numerous students to receive care services, and this is 
expected to bring positive ripple effects, from the early reinstatement 
of parents whose career was discontinued due to childcare burdens to 
the creation of new jobs at afterschool care facilities. As of last year, 
we helped create 976 afterschool care classrooms at 639 schools, and 
we will increase the number of these classrooms to 2,500 by 2022 to 
benefit more than 50,000 children.044Support for Afterschool Care ServicesKRW 30 billionSupport the construction and expansion of nationalkindergartens situated next to elementary school as well aselementary afterschool care classrooms(a total of KRW 75 billion to be provided by 2022)We provide a range of educational programs to bring hope to future 
generations so that they can pursue their dreams. With ‘mentoring’ 
as the key agenda, KB Kookmin Bank is implementing a systemic 
CSR business portfolio: ‘Mentoring for Learning’ targets teens 
from low-income or multicultural families who often lack learning 
opportunities to provide one-on-two mentoring, English learning, 
and scholarships; ‘Mentoring for Career Path’ offers diverse career 
experience programs to help these teens make a suitable career 
choice; ‘Mentoring for Digital Future’ aims to nurture creative talent 
desired by the 4th Industrial Revolution era. KB Securities and KB 
Insurance help improve the learning and residential environment for 
children and teens from low-income families while KB Kookmin Card 
provides arts, music and sports educational programs to children with 
disabilities to help them stand on their own feet.KB Financial Group offers continued support for ‘Korean learning’ 
as it constitutes an essential component in helping multicultural 
individuals adapt to Korean society, and assists them in obtaining 
the qualifications required for employment and receiving vocational 
training. Notably, our ‘KB Rainbow Love Camp’ and ‘Multicultural 
Understanding Classroom’ have been established as one of KB 
Financial Group’s unique programs that allow these children to expand 
their horizons and increase mutual understanding and exchange. We 
also care for North Korean adolescent refugees by supporting their 
school facilities and offering education to help them gain personal 
identity, which will surely contribute to their becoming a healthy 
member of our society.Our social contribution initiatives also include ‘economic & financial 
education’ that leverages our competency as a financial institution. 
Since the establishment of the ‘KB Foundation’ as a non-profit 
foundation, we have provided wide-ranging economic and financial 
education programs over the past decade to make these programs 
a major part of our social contribution activities and to present new 
directions for economic and financial education through different 
programs and teaching methods that cater to changing social needs. 
The foundation created a group of professional instructors for 
economic and financial education to visit elementary/middle/high 
schools, military units, and big supermarkets to offer education976 classrooms created

collaboration with undergraduate students to deliver customized 
economic and financial education to future generations. As of last 
year, KB Financial Group’s economic and financial education benefited 
more than 172,000 people.Creating Greater Social ValueSupporting the resolution of social needs and shared  
growth with local communities 
KB Financial Group makes use of the inherent characteristics of 
respective business areas based on its wide-ranging business 
portfolio that include banking, securities, and insurance with an aim 
to create greater social value. .We formed a social investment fund with K-Growth to create a social 
financial ecosystem that nurtures social enterprises and promotes 
their self-reliance. Valued at KRW 100 billion, this fund invests in 
social enterprises capable of creating a positive impact in the areas 
of society and environment in compliance with the UN SDGs. These 
investments are made in social ventures that generate meaningful 
social impact as well as certified social enterprises to pursue bothSocial Contribution045capabilities and help resolve unemployment issues.As recently emerging environmental issues require our concerted 
efforts among governments, people and businesses, KB Financial 
Group is taking the lead in fulfilling its social responsibility through 
varying eco-friendly social contribution programs. The ‘KB Kookmin 
Bank Forest’ was created in Mongolia, where yellow dust and 
microdust originate from, to lower microdust levels while air purifiers 
were installed at local children’s centers as microdust poses higher 
risks to children. Educational books were also published in line with 
this initiative and environmental education was provided to teens to 
help them develop a sense of stewardship towards the environment. 
Furthermore, eco-friendly financial instruments are developed to 
engage customers in our social contribution initiatives. We’ve become 
the first in the financial industry to release the ‘KB Clean Sky Financial 
Package’ to encourage consumers to voluntarily help in resolving 
microdust issues: donations raised through its proceeds go to create 
forests in urban areas and provide eco-friendly condensing boilers to 
welfare facilities. In so doing, we conserve the environment for our 
future generations and create a sustainable society.KB Financial Group also endeavors on diverse fronts to pursue 
shared growth with the global community. KB Kookmin Bank offers 
health care services to immigrant workers living in Korea and helps 
Cambodian children suffering from heart disease pay for their surgery, 
and since 2008, 527 undergraduates have joined its global volunteer 
group ‘RaonAtti’ to volunteer in less-developed countries. KB

campaign to encourage its employees to assemble photovoltaic 
lanterns and donate them to countries suffering energy shortages 
to help local children enjoy better living conditions. KB Daehan

uncertainties and the continued shrinkage in domestic economic 
activities. In the face of these challenging business conditions, KB 
Financial Group strengthened its future growth driver and digital 
competitiveness to pave the way for its sustained growth into Asia’s 
leading global financial group. We pursued stability and balance in 
asset growth to reinforce our earnings fundamental while relentlessly 
improving the credit portfolio with our proved conservative risk 
management.As to business results in 2019, KB Financial Group’s total assets rose by 
KRW 38.9 trillion from the previous year to KRW 518.5 trillion, which 
is attributable to the solid asset growth mostly focused on prime 
household and SME loans. Net interest income increased mostly 
led by quality loan growth and our endeavors to defend margins. 
Non-interest income also increased contributed to improvement 
performance in trusts and IB businesses as well as securities, F/X 
and derivatives. The Group’s net income posted KRW 3,311.8 billion, 
increased by KRW 250.6 billion from the previous year. In asset quality, 
the group NPL ratio fell by 0.11%p from the previous year to 0.48%. 
This is mainly due to our continued commitment to improving credit 
quality of loan portfolio by increasing portion of prime quality assets  
while reducing potential non-performing loans and continuing 
preemptive and conservative risk management. Under Basel III, group 
BIS ratio and CET 1 ratio are to mark 14.48% and 13.59% respectively.

In 2019, KB Financial Group’s net income amounted to KRW 3,311.8 
billion, up by 8.2% from the previous year mainly due to robust 
increase in interest income in the banking and card business as well 
as solid growth in non-interest income, including fee and commission 
income from trust and IB Business, and profit from securities, FX, and 
derivatives.Group Profitability Overview(KRW in billions, %)Net Interest IncomeNet Fee & Commission IncomeOther Operating ProfitGross Operating IncomeG&A ExpensesProvision for Credit LossesNet Operating ProfitNet Non-Operating ProfitProfit for the Period201920189,196.88,904.92,355.02,243.4(119.9)(288.6)11,431.910,859.76,271.05,918.5670.3673.74,490.64,267.543.334.13,313.23,061.9Profit attributable to controlling interests3,311.83,061.2YoY3.35.0N.A.5.36.0(0.5)5.227.08.28.2Group Net Income Trends(KRW in billions)3,3113,3123,0612,1441,69820152016201720182019Banking 69.2%Non-banking 30.8%2019050KB Financial Group’s net interest income amounted to KRW 9,196.8 
billion, up by 3.3% from the previous year. This is attributed to 
increases in average loan balances mostly backed by the balanced 
growth of prime retail unsecured loans and prime SME and SOHO 
loans as well as to the increased contribution from the interest income 
generated by its card business. In 2019, net interest margin(NIM) of  
the group and bank stood at 1.94% and 1.67% respectively: bank NIM 
inched down only by 4bp from the previous year despite key rate cuts 
and intensifying market competition.KB Financial Group’s net fee and commission income rose by 5.0% 
from the previous year to KRW 2,355.0 billion as trust income of 
the bank and group IB business increased in spite of the significant 
reductions posted in securities brokerage commissions amid the 
sluggish stock market. Other operating profit improved by KRW 168.7 
billion from the previous year mostly due to a increase in gains on 
valuation of bonds resulted from declining market interest rates and 
improvement on profits from sales & trading in the securities business, 
while insurance-related profits fell due to the worsening loss ratios of 
auto insurance and long-term insurance plans.G&A expenses recorded a 6.0% YoY growth to KRW 6,271.0 billion: 
ERP costs occurred in Kookmin Bank and KB Insurance, and 
digitalization costs – amortizing expenses and computing work 
expenses – related to the digitalization initiative undertaken at 
the group level were recognized. In 2019, the Group cost-income 
ratio(CIR) remained almost unchanged from the previous year at 
54.9% in line with ERP costs and increasing digitalization costs. 
However, on a recurring basis disregarding ERP and digitalization 
costs etc., CIR recorded to 50.9% presenting continued improvements 
in cost efficiency in line with visible cost savings from ERP and group-
wide cost control efforts. As digitalization costs are forecast to 
increase for the time being to respond to digitalization, open banking 
and other changes affecting the financial landscape, KB Financial 
Group will continue to tighten the level of cost control by revisiting 
every costs groupwide on a zeo base except investment for future 
growth such as digitalization.Provision for credit losses fell by 0.5% YoY to KRW 670.3 billion: while 
the amount of loans increased, KB Financial Group pursued qualitative 
growth with a focus on high-quality assets as well as preemptive risk 
management, which also contributed to maintaining a low credit cost 
ratio of 0.20%.By subsidiary, KB Kookmin Bank’s profit for the year in 2019 reached 
KRW 2,439.1 billion, up by KRW 179.9 billion from the previous year, as 
its net interest income and net fee and commission income posted 
solid growth. Its net interest income rose by KRW 263.1 billion from 
the previous year to KRW 6,363.8 billion thanks to the sustained high-
quality growth in assets. Its net fee and commission income inched up 
to KRW 1,133.3 billion mainly backed by growth in commission from 
trust and IB business in spite of the stock market remaining sluggish. 
Improvent in profit from securities, F/X, and derivatives drove its other 
operating income up by KRW 192.1 billion from the previous year, 
and gross operating income increased by KRW 465.1 billion YoY to 
KRW 7,319.1 billion. G&A expenses grew by KRW 120.4 billion from 
the previous year to KRW 3,887.4 billion mainly due to increasing 
digitalization costs such as amortization costs, resulting from the 
introduction of next-generation IT systems and other digitalization 
endeavors. Provision for credit losses rose by KRW 9.6 billion only to 
KRW 103.5 billion driven by the bank’s premptive and conservative 
risk management to manage credit quality in spite of its growing asset 
size. Since growing uncertainties, including COVID 19, could result in 
deterioration of asset quality especially for subprime borrowers, KB 
Kookmin Bank will closely monitor relevant indicators and reinforce 
its risk management, taking a conservative stance on asset quality 
management.KB Kookmin Bank Profitability Overview(KRW in billions)

79.1 billion from the previous year to KRW 257.9 billion: declining 
market interest rates contributed to increasing its gain on valuation 
of bonds and stablizing its ELS and other derivatives performance, 
which showed augumented results last year, led to improve its sales & 
trading income, while the promissory note issuance business launched 
last year resulted in performance improvement in the IB businesses.Management Discussion & AnalysisIn 2019, KB Insurance’s net income fell by KRW 28.0 billion from the 
previous year to KRW 234.3 billion due to the deteriorating loss ratios 
witnessed mainly in auto and long-term insurance across the industry 
and the increasing operational expenses caused by intensifying 
competition over new contract.In 2019, KB Kookmin Card’s profit for the period amounted to KRW 
316.5 billion, up by KRW 29.9 billion from the previous year, which is 
attributable to increases in interest income generated by growing card 
transaction amounts, steadfast endeavors to improve cost efficiency, 
and expanding financial assets including installment financing and 
lease business.001   Introduction

In 2019, KB Financial Group’s provision for credit losses amounted 
to KRW 670.3 billion, which fell slightly from the previous year due 
to quality growth generated mainly in high-quality assets and its 
premptive risk management in the face of the economic downturn.

which is attributed to its endeavors to reduce potential NPLs and to 
proactively manage asset quality in so doing. Its NPL ratio improved 
by 0.11%p from the previous year to 0.37%: the bank strove to 
improve its credit quality of corporate loan portfolio by increasing 
the portion of prime rating loans and by pursuing preemptive risk 
management  and proactive sales and write-offs of NPLs. Its NPL 
coverage ratio rose by 7.9%p from the previous year to 130.2%, which 
is at the highest level in the banking industry, and  this is attributed to 
reductions in NPLs and its conservative approach to provisioning. KB 
Kookmin Bank’s credit cost remained at the significantly low level of 
0.04%, based on its endeavor for quality growth and the reversal of 
provisions.KB Kookmin Card focused on conservative credit quality management  
and strengthened premptive risk management in the face of 
mounting concerns over worsening asset quality as a result of the 
economic slowdown. This drove down its delinquency ratio by 0.09%p 
from the previous year to 1.11%, and its NPL ratio remains stable.Delinquency RatioKB Kookmin Bank

KB Financial Group’s BIS and CET 1 ratios recorded to 14.48% 
and 13.59%, down by 0.12%p and 0.38%p from the previous year 
respectively. While this attributed to increases in risk-weighted assets 
in line with its growing asset, the group still maintains its strong 
capital position at the highest level in the Korean financial industry. 
Considering growing uncertainties and tightening regulations for 
capital management of financial institutions, KB Financial Group will 
strategically respond to the environment utilizing issuance of hybrid 
securities and other contingent convertible bonds while maintaining

first in the National Customer 
Satisfaction Index for 13 
consecutive years, for the first 
time in the banking industry.Retail Banking
In 2019, the retail banking market experienced increasing fluctuations 
in demographics and social trends in line with accelerating aging, an 
increasing prevalence of single households, an emerging demand 
for corporate social responsibility, growing interest in nation-wide 
environmental protection and eco-friendliness, and demands for a 
work-life balance and productivity gains spurred on by the 52-hour 
workweek policy. Wide-ranging changes were also witnessed across 
the regulatory landscape, including the revision of the Banking Act 
to approve the additional establishment of internet-only banks, 
tightening regulations on household loans and consumer protection, 
strengthened support to facilitate fintech(financial regulatory sandbox), 
and data deregulation.Innovative Customer Centric Systems and Processes 
In response to shifting demographics and customer transactions and 
needs, KB Kookmin Bank created new customer-centric indicators and 
developed a monitoring system to solidify the tailor-made customer 
management system while improving its customer management 
process for effective customer management. In addition, the ‘KB Star 
Dream Service’ was launched to further provide customized contents 
for respective VIP customer segments.We also launched new specialty products to reflect changing 
demographics and social trends, including the ‘KB Clean Sky Installment 
Deposit’(Mar. 2019) to strengthen our image as a socially responsible 
company that cares for the environment, ‘280 Days for My Baby 
Installment Deposit’(Jun. 2019) to target expecting mothers, and ‘KB X 
BTS Installment Deposit’(Oct. 2019) developed in collaboration with the 
global idol band BTS, following its first version unveiled in 2018. Notably, 
the ‘KB X BTS Installment Deposit’ posted nearly 68,000 in number of 
accounts and KRW 25 billion in balance in just two months since its 
launching.Given the prolonged low growth and low interest rates and the 
intensifying competition spurred by the entry of fintech businesses 
into the financial industry, KB Kookmin Bank will effectively respond to 
demographic shifts, governmental financial policies, and the changing 
regulatory landscape by promoting data-based segmented customer 
management and the more sophisticated identification of potential 
VIP customers, developing products that set the social trends, and 
expanding digital innovation as well as non-face-to-face channel 
products and services.Strengthening Group-wide One-Firm WM Collaboration 
We continued to broaden the coverage of multi-service WM branches 
to generate greater One-Firm synergy between banking and securities 
subsidiaries, and opened PB centers(WM multi-service branches) 
within the business districts where main corporate clients are located 
to invigorate our corporate asset management business. A dedicated 
team for securities firms was set up and the pilot operation was 
initiated on a multi-service branch model that adopted the proximate 
arrangement of WM and corporate banking counters.KB Kookmin Bank055In addition, the existing collaboration system was improved to advance 
corporate finance-WM collaboration. Such as the ‘P-PB System’ was 
launched to provide specialized ‘total asset management solutions’ to 
corporate customers, and the ‘RM-VM One Team System’ was initiated 
in retail branches to improve working-level sales execution and 
generate collaborative outcomes in serving corporate clients.Meanwhile, we launched the ‘KB Family UP Advisory Service’ brand and 
initiated its operation. Wealth management consulting was provided to 
those with professional careers as well as major corporate customers 
and their employees, and our WM advisory business improved its 
competitiveness by expanding the support of itinerant consulting, 
lectures and seminars for corporate customers maintaining outstanding 
business relationships with us. Also, we continuously worked to diversify 
our real estate investment advisory business and to generate profits by 
taking actions such as implementing the ‘Rebalancing & Value Added’ 
service for real estate assets and operating the ‘Real Estate Emergency 
Committee’ to respond to government policies.In 2020, we plan to facilitate our wealth management operations by 
developing a new WM business model to innovate our WM channels 
by customer segment and providing ‘seminars’ and ‘professional 
counseling’ to diverse customers. We will also expand the range of our 
distinguished advisory service by providing systematic support services 
for land compensation process, ‘legal risk assessment’ services for 
SMEs and CEOs and ‘specialized tax’ services for overseas Koreans.Corporate Banking
In the face of economic downturn and other sustained challenges in 
the business landscape, we pursued qualitative growth with a focus 
on high-quality assets to continue with sustainable growth, and 
endeavored to secure solid growth engines by advancing into the 
global IB market and developing IB services.To sum up some of our major achievements, we topped the Bloomberg 
League Table’s Syndicated loan arrangement category for four 
consecutive years to maintain our No. 1 market leadership position 
while successfully arranging the Seoul IFC Mall refinancing worth 
KRW 2.3 trillion and the KRW 2.0 trillion Sin Ansan double track railway 
private investment project. We also broadened the coverage of our 
global business through wide-ranging overseas deals including the 
refinancing of the U.S.-based Lackawanna Center.The utility of blind funds was improved and deal sourcing was 
strengthened in aircraft financing and other key business areas to 
secure a stable profit base while institutional improvements were made 
from multiple angles to establish a globally recognized infrastructure, 
including the improvement of the double counting system to handle 
global collaboration deals.Fully Advancing into the Global IB Market 
In 2019, we completed our regional hub network across Hong Kong, 
London and New York. These regional hubs will help us expand our 
business lineups in advanced markets based on our partnershipwith local financial institutions and serve as the main pillar of our 
IB operations to strengthen our group-wide IB competitiveness. 
Furthermore, we will build new growth drivers in the global market to 
pave the way to ultimately emerge as a global IB player.In 2020, we will fully advance into the global markets on the strength of 
our Hong Kong, London, and New Yok regional hubs and do our utmost 
to lay the basis for KB Financial Group to leap forward onto the global 
stage. This will be done by creating a team dedicated to the exploration 
of new markets and establishing the ‘Hub & Spoke’ operational system 
with Hong Kong, New York, and London serving as the ‘Hub’ and 
nearby regions as the ‘Spokes’. In preparation for the growing market 
uncertainties, we will continue to improve our asset portfolio to pursue 
qualitative growth with a focus on riskless assets and elevate capital 
efficiency while transforming ourselves into a global IB player to secure 
future growth momentum over the long haul.SME Banking
Leading Financial Support for SMEs
KB Kookmin Bank strengthened support for productive finance and fully 
responded to relevant governmental policies to posted an increase of 
KRW 5.2 trillion in SME loans in 2019 to become the first commercial 
bank to reach KRW 100 trillion in SME loan balances and is currently 
maintaining its No. 1 leadership position in market shares. Notably, the 
ratio of prime rating loans extended to healthy SMEs rose by 2.7%p YoY 
from 74.7% at the end of 2018 to 77.4%, which in turn allowed us to 
record the lowest delinquency rate of 0.55% among commercial banks.Leading Support for Innovative Finance 
Our credit supply continues to expand, with KRW 12.5 trillion newly 
provided for technology finance as a way to facilitate innovative 
financing. Also, our non-financial services are increasing their support 
for SMEs and self-employed businesses as demonstrated in 3,860 cases 
of job placement arranged through the ‘KB Good Job’ and 1,674 cases 
of consulting assistance provided through the ‘KB SoHo Consulting 
Center’.Number of KB Kookmin Bank's Customers31.5 millionKB Kookmin Bank has the 
largest customer base in the 
domestic banking industry.056Pursuing the Digitalization of Corporate Financing 
We accelerate the digitalization of our corporate finance operations 
to proactively respond to the rapidly-changing business environment. 
Our ‘KB bridge’ app recommends optimal governmental policy funds to 
corporate customers based on their specific needs so that they can be 
swiftly provided with the necessary funds, and the ‘Corporate Financing 
ACE’ was developed exclusively for our corporate finance staff to help 
them reduce their workload and focus more of their time on corporate 
customer marketing. We also created the ‘KB Corporate Customer 
Preferential Support System’ to upgrade our corporate customer 
management and reward provision system. While 2020 is expected to 
suffer increasing external volatility and the protracted economic downturn, 
we will continue to attract prime customers to further step ahead of the 
competition as the dominant player with the largest market share.Global Operation
Over the years, we have advanced into the digital banking, micro 
finance and other diverse business areas in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, 
and Vietnam to better understand and accumulate experience 
with these markets. In January 2020, we signed a stock purchase 
agreement(SPA) to acquire a 70% stake in PRASAC Microfinance, 
Cambodia’s largest Microfinance Deposit-taking Institution(MDI) 
while opening new local branches under Myanmar’s MFI and our 
Cambodian subsidiary as well as KB Kookmin Bank branches in Hanoi, 
Vietnam and Gurugram, India, further broadening our global network. 
Included in other tangible outcomes from our global operations is Liiv 
KB Cambodia which posted a consistent growth in number of members 
with its strengthened service competitiveness as the nation’s global 
digital banking platform.In 2020, we plan to follow the Two-Track strategy both in Southeast 
Asia and other advanced markets to continuously expand our global 
presence. We will pursue non-organic growth through M&A and equity 
investment, and leverage digital banking in connection with our offline 
channel strategy to improve the accessibility of our retail service for 
retail and SME customers in emerging Asian economies with high 
growth potentials. To tap into mature financial markets with stable 
financial systems in place, we will expand our branch and subsidiary 
network in key regional hubs and use this network to secure our profit 
base with a focus on CIB and capital market businesses.Expanding Global Presence 
In December 2019, we made the decision to acquire a 70% stake 
in PRASAC Microfinance in Cambodia. With a local network of 117 
locations, PRASAC is ranked third among financial institutions in loan 
market share. KB Kookmin Bank plans to transform PRASAC into a 
commercial bank to transfer its exceptional retail capabilities and help 
PRASAC evolve into a leading commercial bank in Cambodia in order to 
broaden its business presence in Southeast Asia.Facilitating Global Export Finance 
KB Kookmin Bank signed a ‘global export finance promotion business 
agreement’ with the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation(K-sure), 
and became the first commercial bank to launch the debtor finance 
instrument ‘KB Global Export Finance’. Upon making shipments on the 
part of the exporter, KB Kookmin Bank’s overseas branch extends loans 
to the importer, taking as security the short-term export insurance 
plan provided by K-sure so that the exporter can receive payments 
through their domestic account. This allows domestic exporters to 
turn their export receivables into cash sooner and without recourse 
while overseas importers can make payments at lower financial costs 
compared to those provided by local banks. In alignment with the 
Korean government’s top priority initiative of the New Southern Policy, 
KB Kookmin Bank will proactively deliver financing support through its 
overseas branch network, in addition to KB Global Export Finance.KB Kookmin Bank also became the first commercial bank to launch 
the ‘KB Global Payment Usance’ service. Concerning imports whose 
payments are made on an open account basis, the domestic importer 
is provided with import finance from an overseas financial institution 
that suggests more competitive interest rates, and then later, they can 
pay the principle and interests at the time of maturity. This product 
will surely enable KB Kookmin Bank to reinforce its wire transfer line-
ups which account for nearly 70% of the total import payments, and to 
respond to the international trade finance trend of moving away from 
letters of credit(LC) to wire transfers.Furthermore, KB Kookmin Bank signed business agreements with the 
global e-commerce settlement service providers of WorldFirst and 
Payoneer, and launched the ‘KB Global eCommerce Sellers Benefit 
Program’ for domestic sellers to receive their sales proceeds generated 
overseas in a more cost-effective and convenient manner. This product 
is expected to revitalize the operations of SME exporters who often 
face difficulties in opening a local bank account as a seller conducting 
business at overseas online market places.In 2020, KB Kookmin Bank will expand its F/X customer base, including SME 
importers and exporters, through the marketing programs led by its head 
office, strengthen its F/X product and service competitiveness through 
improved non-face-to-face F/X services, and reinforce marketing support 
to pave the way for the sustained growth of its F/X business.Trust 
KB Kookmin Bank continued to face challenging conditions in the 
overall trust market due to shrinking investor confidence and declining 
global stock market indices. In the second half of 2019, derivatives-
linked fund(DLF) products linked with offshore interest rates created 
serious issues to eventually prompt the financial authorities to impose 
restrictions on high-risk financial instruments and tighten relevant 
regulations. Even amid such unfavorable business conditions, our 
proactive customer management, strategic marketing campaigns, and 
the launching of customized ELT products enabled us to rank first in the 
industry, with KRW 26.4 trillion in money trust AUM and 19.3% in marketKB Kookmin Bank057share. We were also able to generate solid profits with KRW 291 billion 
in annual revenue from trust operations for the year of 2019.In 2019, a range of specialty products were unveiled to create the trust 
product line-ups that satisfy customer needs and increase our product 
competitive edge. These specialty products included the ‘KB Clean Sky 
Trust’ designed to contribute to reducing microdust levels, the integrated 
inheritance-bequeath solution ‘KB The Great Heritage Trust’ and the 
‘Family Business Succession Trust’ that facilitates asset succession at 
SMEs. To respond to future trends and reflect current market conditions, 
our ‘Short Strangle ETN Trust’ leverages option transfer/selling to 
address the stock market trend of prices repeating ups and downs 
within a certain range, the ‘KB Mini Gold Bar Trust’ addresses preference 
for risk-free assets and declining benchmark rates, and ‘U.S. REITs EFT 
Trust’ invests in U.S.-located commercial real estate.In 2020, we plan to maintain the similar level of profits of 2019 by 
continuously increasing the profitability of equity-linked trusts, our key 
profit-generating product. We will also be pursuing quantitative profit 
growth through the expanded line-ups of equity-based and alternative 
investment products, providing a portfolio of products that cater to 
each specific stage of a customer’s life cycle, and delivering specialty 
products that are in line with the latest trends. In the mid-to-long 
term, we will upgrade our customer-based asset management system 
to retain customers and increase their loyalty, and perform stringent 
reviews on complete sales and post-sales management to reinforce our 
financial consumer protection system.Money Trust DepositoryKRW26.4trillionKB Kookmin Bank accounted for 19.3% of the total

provides one-on-one pension asset management services recruited 
more counselors and set up a team dedicated to improving our 
customers’ rate of returns in order to deliver differentiated customer 
management services, including pension asset portfolio rebalancing. 
The pension expert program was also created to provide customized 
asset management services according to different life cycle stages 
based on comprehensive counseling capabilities in the areas of public 
pensions, retirement pensions and personal pensions.The ’12 Moments of Happiness’ was added to our pension portfolio as 
an installment payment option for our senior customers to help them 
generate a stable source of income following retirement. Furthermore, 
the ‘KB Golden Life Specialty Service’ was significantly reinforced, and 
the ‘Premium Health Care Service’ was launched to deliver diverse 
health care services, the first of its kind in the banking industry as a way 
to provide a range of services.In 2020, the Retirement Pension Asset Management Consulting 
Center will extend its work scope and recruit more employees to 
increase customers’ rate of returns, and the operation of our pension 
expert training course will be upgraded to deliver comprehensive and 
professional pension asset management services.We will deploy a non-face-to-face channel system 2.0 for our pension 
fund business. This will provide a virtual user environment that ensures 
improved and quicker around-the-clock accessibility throughout the 
year. Our UI/UX will be reconfigured to enable customers to intuitively 
understand and access all data and processes across non-face-to-
face channels, and AI-powered lifecycle asset management solutions 
will be offered to establish an end-to-end pension asset counseling 
system spanning from premium payment and asset operation to benefit 
payment and taxation. We also plan to develop the ‘KB One-Senior 
Platform’ to deliver health care services for senior customers and other 
personalized customer service packages as a way to solidify our status 
as a professional pension service provider.Pension
To solidify its status as a leading bank in the pension market, KB 
Kookmin Bank strengthens the management of its rate of returns 
for customers and offers them differentiated specialty products 
while using its digitally-based total asset management system to 
support customers with their pension asset management. In 2019, our 
contribution reserve rose by KRW 3.7 trillion from the previous year to 
KRW 23.4 trillion to top all the other pension business operators in net 
reserve increase for two consecutive years. We developed the ‘KBot

In 2019, even though the global financial markets experienced 
continuous fluctuations due to the U.S.-China trade dispute and 
concerns over the global economic slowdown. KB Kookmin Bank 
successfully issued sustainability bonds in diverse formats based on 
its outstanding credit ratings (Moody’s: Aa3, S&P: A+, Fitch: A), which 
are the highest among Korea’s commercial lenders, as well as on its 
exceptional business performances.KB Kookmin Bank flexibly conducted business to respond to increasing 
volatility in interest rates while expanding the investment asset size  to 
eventually set a new record in operational performance over the past 
decade. We have strengthened our flow business basis and expanded 
synergy-based transactions by intensive collaboration with our sales 
channels and subsidiaries. To broaden our overseas business, the 
London capital markets desk initiated to build up its trading position 
actively in 2019 and we have dispatched expert employees to establish 
Indian and Vietnamese desks.In February 2019, we issued 10-year subordinated sustainability bonds 
with a nominal amount of USD 450 million, which drew investors’ 
attention as the first foreign currency-denominated subordinated 
bonds since the merger of the former Kookmin Bank and H&CB in 2001 
and as the first such bonds in sustainability bond format in Korea. This 
successful issuance, with spread of 187.5bps over the 10-year U.S. 
Treasury, ended up building nearly USD 1.7 billion of orders from a total 
of 110 institutional investors.In July, we also raised USD 500 million of Tier 1 subordinated bond 
which is Basel III compliant as well as Korea’s first foreign currency-
denominated subordinated sustainability bond. The issuance attracted 
orders in the amount of USD 2.7 billion, 5.4 times greater than the 
issued amount, from a total of 128 global investors.By issuing sustainability bonds in 2019, KB Kookmin Bank was able to 
secure new funding sources as well as to diversify investor spectrum 
which include socially responsible investors. Going forward, we will 
continue to issue ESG-related bonds, along with covered bonds and 
subordinated bonds to diversify our funding structure.In 2020, we plan to preemptively respond to the changes in financial 
environment and strengthen our human/physical capabilities in

strategies to pursue profitability while gradually expanding our global 
business presence and infrastructure and accelerating digitalization to 
strengthen our profit base and promote sustainable growth.Smart Banking
Proactively Responding to the Shifting Digital  
Finance Landscape 
In 2019, the opening of the financial infrastructure, as illustrated by the 
open banking initiative, and the introduction of the financial regulatory 
sandbox broke down the barriers that had separated industries and 
spurred competition and innovation. To turn this rapid change in the 
financial environment into opportunity, KB Kookmin Bank endeavored 
to create a convergence-driven ecosystem to collaborate with diverse 
players. We developed 157 open APIs to easily connect financial 
services with external platforms, and our cloud-based collaboration 
platform ‘CLAYON’ became the industry’s first to complete ‘cloud 
service provider safety assessments’ to pave the way to deploy financial 
services in the cloud environment. We also capitalized on the financial 
regulatory sandbox to launch innovative services that were barely 
available in the conventional financial environment. The MVNO-based 
finance-telecommunication hybrid service ‘Liiv M’ was unveiled to 
take a bold step into the previously-untapped ‘telecommunications’ 
market to broaden the KB financial ecosystem. Going forward, we will 
focus on the development of new innovative products and services 
through telecommunication-data convergence to move ahead of the 
competition and build distinctive competitiveness.Strengthening Digital Platform Competitiveness 
On the service front, we launched the AI-enabled counseling chatbot 
service to provide easy and convenient 24/7 counseling services, and 
developed the ‘KB Mobile Certificate’ to allow customers to easily 
process their transactions through biometric certification, simple 
passwords, and pattern certification without a physical security 
medium in order to deliver new customer experience and improve user 
convenience.We also continued to reorganize our digital platforms. The ‘Open 
Banking’ service, which enables customers to register their accounts 
at other banks for account checks and transfers, was adapted to Star 
Banking, internet banking, Liiv, and Liiv Talk Talk, and KB my money 
was upgraded to address the shifting data industry landscape and 
strengthen our competitive edge as an asset manager. Our Liiv Talk Talk 
and Liiv platforms were equipped with scanning apps and additional 
financial product offerings to improve the financial expertise and 
usability of respective platforms.Infrastructure-wise, our cloud-based collaboration platform CLAYON 
was leveraged to deliver Liiv M services to set an example in using 
cloud infrastructure for financial services. Our non-face-to-face log 
collection system was also upgraded to strengthen the analytics of 
customer behavior data, creating a financial environment conducive to 
the development of digital financial services.KB Kookmin Bank059Delivering MVNO-based Finance-Telecommunication  
Hybrid Services 
KB Kookmin Bank unveiled the industry’s first MVNO-based 
telecommunication service ‘Liiv M’ to deliver innovative services and 
products that combine finance with telecommunications in order 
to create new customer experience and social value. Following the 
opening of its beta version in November 2019, this service fully opened 
on December 16, and has since provided services differentiated from 
the conventional MNVO counterparts by launching first-ever MVNO 
5G plans and the membership service to turn monthly unclaimed data 
credits into Liiv Mate points.We provide such innovative financial services as the USIM KB Mobile 
Certificate, the USIM personal information storage service, and the 
ATM withdrawal control service designed to prevent voice phishing 
frauds by disallowing the simultaneous use of a phone while making 
withdrawals in order to improve customer safety and convenience. 
Meanwhile, we offer ‘sharing discounts’ to vulnerable individuals 
and opened the Liiv M Zone within our branch to provide face-to-
face counseling support for the digitally-underprivileged in order to 
strengthen our inclusive finance initiative.Improving Diverse Functionalities for Greater  
Customer Convenience 
In keeping with our public certificate log-in policy, which is rather 
complicated due to the inherent features of it being a banking app, we 
introduced a simpler log-in method that allows customers to use their 
mobile phone number as their ID, as the log-in was often cited as one 
of the user pain points. KB Real Estate Liiv ON is available across the PC 
web, mobile web, and mobile app channels, and customers can log in 
on any these channels to access the Liiv ON with their personal mobile 
phone number, which has significantly improved user convenience in 
regards to the log in process. Concerning data searching, our ‘natural 
language’ processing search function was upgraded to allow customers 
to type in single word segments without word spacing in the integrated 
search box to minimize the errors that may arise during real estate 
content research.Providing Real Estate Data Contents to Customers through 
Social Network Channels 
KB Real Estate Liiv ON leverages KB’s real estate price data recognized 
for its market dominance to directly produce season/issue-specific 
real estate information and delivers wide-ranging real estate contents 
across the four leading social network channels of Naver Post, Kakao 
1boon, Youtube, and Facebook. Since this service was launched at 
the end of March 2019, its cumulative views reached 11 million at 
the end of 2019 which goes to demonstrate the huge interest in and 
appreciation for the Liiv ON contents granted by numerous customers 
who are keeping a constant eye on the real estate market.In 2020, we are working to migrate our service platform into the cloud 
environment and improve the flexibility of our platform to allow for 
collaboration with external startup businesses. In so doing, KB Kookmin 
Bank will embrace a UI/UX that delivers digitally-based easy-to-
understand visual contents and maximizes user convenience while 
swiftly catering to customer needs.Plans for 2020 
In 2020, the full-fledged opening of the financial infrastructure through 
the expansion of open banking services and the initiation of My Data 
business will further blur the lines between the financial industry and 
other industries, increase convergence services among heterogenous 
industries, and accelerate the ‘Financial Nomad’ trend with the emergence 
of customers who constantly shift among financial institutions for 
greater benefits. KB Kookmin Bank’s response to these trends will be to 
understand customers and deliver positive customer experience and new 
value in order to advance ‘customer-centric digital finance’.We will analyze log data and gather candid customer feedback when 
it is time for the platform renovation to integrate such feedback into 
our service improvement. We will provide personalized and useful 
information through customer behavior data analytics, identify 
customers’ pain points to resolve any inconvenience they may face, 
and develop necessary benefits and services even before customers 
become aware of such needs in order to improve the qualitative 
competitiveness of our service.We will also change the way we conduct business to swiftly address 
customer needs. While expanding our ‘ACE(Agile, Centric, Efficient)’ 
experience through Agile units to weave Agile into our corporate 
DNA, we will also promote collaboration by embracing co-location for 
our business units and IT operations. We will continue to hire outside 
experts and ICT staff and strengthen digital training for employees to 
nurture our digital workforce in order to reinforce our fundamentals for 
digital finance.Banking Service157

KB Securities opened five more multi-service branches in 2019 to 
expand WM coverage between banking and securities operations, 
which increased the number of these branches to a total of 70 as of 
the end of 2019. The continued improvement of joint business models 
including the KB Kookmin Bank-KB Securities pairing system and 
the offering of customer-centric tailor-made wealth management 
services raised our referral-based WM asset size by 9.5% YoY to KRW 
7.4 trillion as of the end of 2019.In IB business, our referral-based CIB revenue reached nearly KRW 
113.0 billion and our contribution deals amounted to 62, which was 
made possible through the strengthened CIB collaboration system 
which included Partnership RM and Co-RM. Our nine CIB centers 
nationwide strive to enhance efficiency in serving banking-securities 
SME customers. As a product factory within KB Financial Group, 
our S&T Division continuously expands the delivery of wide-ranging 
products that cater to customer needs. Our increased banking-
securities synergy and the resulting operational expansion enabled us 
to post nearly KRW 4.8 trillion in products delivered to banks(KRW 2.9 
trillion in derivative-linked securities and KRW 1.9 trillion in bonds).Strengthening digital competitiveness 
KB Securities pursues company-wide digital transformation to 
improve work efficiency and provide differentiated customer service. 
This allowed us to create a smart work environment enabled by 
Robotics Process Automation and chatbots and to reduce nearly 
30,000 hours of work on a cumulative annual basis through the 
Work Diet initiative. In addition, open APIs were leveraged in offering 
financial services, including account set-ups and account transaction 
inquiries, to build an open platform ecosystem and form partnerships 
with external startups and fintech businesses.Such partnerships continue to expand as we launched a non-face-
to-face discretionary investment robo advisor service app through 
a partnership with a robo advisor company in April 2019 while 
opening a fund care service in our integrated wealth management 
service app in October 2019. These endeavors enabled us to reach 
a total of 190,000 in new accounts opened through non-face-to-
face channels as of the end of 2019, which is up by 27% from 2018, 
and to surpass 350,000 in monthly active users(MAU) by improving 
user convenience – upgrading MTS UI/UX and adopting the Kakao 
authentication for the first time in the industry. Furthermore, we 
became the first in the domestic financial industry to be honored 
with the ‘Digital Transformer Award’ by IDC, a globally-renowned IT 
market research firm.Exceeding KRW 2 trillion in bills issued through KB able 
Since we were granted the short-term financing business license 
from the Financial Services Commission in May 2019, we posted 
nearly KRW 2.1 trillion in bills issued as of the end of 2019. We ensure 
that 50% or more of the funds created as such are invested in 
corporate financing-related assets. This is done in consideration ofKB Securities061the governmental regulation to invest more than 50% of these into 
corporate financing assets as well as internal risk management limits. 
We also intend to gradually increase our investments in innovative 
SMEs and other venture capital.Surpassing 100,000 in Global One Market  
service customers 
In January 2019, KB Securities unveiled the Global One Market service 
to enable customers to trade overseas stocks in six markets including 
the U.S., Hong Kong, Japan, China and Vietnam in Korean won, free 
from foreign exchange charges. This service was so popular that 
there were more than 100,000 users by the end of 2019. KB Securities 
aims to strengthen its competitive edge in global investment service 
by delivering such differentiated products and services that assist 
customers in diversifying their global investment portfolio, which 
include overseas securities, with greater convenience.Ranking first in the DCM for nine consecutive years 
KB Securities posted 22.4% market share(based on Bloomberg) in 
Debt Capital Market(DCM) in 2019, proudly topping the DCM league 
table for nine consecutive years since 2011. In 2019, we also became 
the first Korean business to underwrite the issuance of ESG bonds and 
the first in Korea to arrange the issuance of Arirang bonds through the 
Qualified Institutional Buyers(QIB) system. Furthermore, we became 
the largest corporate bill underwriter to build a short and long-term 
corporate financing platform while initiating bill issuance service as a 
way to offer competitive products to customers. Going forward, we 
plan to solidify our market leadership by exploring optimal financing 
options that satisfy the needs of issuers and investors.Plans for 2020
Uncertainties are forecast to continue for the time being in the real 
economy both at home and abroad and in the financial market. 
The competition in the securities sector will only intensify further, 
especially among big securities firms. This prompts us at KB Securities 
to strengthen our intrinsic core competitive edge and to identify new 
growth drivers and expand our global presence in order to securea leading position in the securities industry. Furthermore, we will 
improve the structural efficiency of our entire operations to sharpen 
our focus on profitability across our business management system.Our business strategy by business area is as follows: in the WM sector, 
we will further reinforce our sales competitiveness to become a solid 
second tier player based on AUM in the WM market. Since building 
long-term customer relationships is the key to a successful WM 
business, our sales system will take a customer-centric approach 
to increase customer returns and prevent any incomplete sales to 
strengthen their protection. In the S&T business, we will continue to 
generate profits based on our strengths in bond management while 
developing best-in-class capabilities in operating overseas bonds, 
in-house assets and ELS hedging to secure solid profits even amid 
diverse financial market conditions.In the IB sector, we will continue to increase profits in those areas 
where we are already competitive, including DCM, growth investment, 
real estate and structured assets while elevating our status as an 
investment bank in corporate financing business – Equity Capital 
Management, acquisition finance, and bill issuance – and in such

KB Insurance leverages KB Financial Group’s wide-ranging business 
areas to share capabilities among subsidiaries and to collaborate 
and generate synergistic value. Facilitating synergy across subsidiary 
planner channels, increasing the use of subsidiary infrastructure, and 
raising awareness among employees and engaging them in synergy 
generation will pave the way to produce synergistic outcomes, and this 
will in turn result in tangible outcomes in 2020 as it has before.In 2019, KB Insurance encouraged its planners to sell products from 
other subsidiaries to expand synergy generated through its own 
planner channel, which raised the number of new cards issued by 24.4% 
YoY to 16,800 at KB Kookmin Card. This helped KB Insurance surpass 
KRW 300 million in CMIP-based product sales to more than triple its 
growth from the previous year. A wide array of synergy activities were 
also undertaken to promote win-win partnerships with other group 
subsidiaries, from payment account campaigns and Magic Car loan 
referral sales to the use of its corporate loan introduction process 
for bank branches. Furthermore, synergy activity reward programs 
and ‘acquaintance referral campaigns’ were operated for subsidiary 
employees to improve their engagement in synergy generation while 
subsidiary databases were analyzed to operate digitally-enabled 
marketing programs in order to broaden the window of marketing 
opportunities and increase cross-subsidiary customers.Long-Term Insurance
In 2019, the long-term insurance market experienced continued 
concerns regarding profitability due to the increasingly fierce 
competition across the industry to generate new sales from term 
insurance products, growth in non-reimbursed claims in relation to the 
Korean government’s policy to expand the national health insurance 
coverage, and increasing loss ratios. Such unfavorable business 
conditions drove down our long-term insurance profit for the year 
by 4.2% to KRW 287 billion while raising our loss ratio by 1.1%p YoY 
to 85.1%. This is mainly attributable to the worsening loss ratio that 
affected the overall industry primarily in indemnity insurance plans. KB 
Insurance will endeavor to refine its contract management and tighten 
its underwriting and claim review process to improve on loss ratios 
while increasing revenues with a focus on contract year-based maturity 
products and diversifying the product portfolio to strengthen its overall 
profit fundamentals.Auto Insurance
While the 2019 car insurance market generally witnessed degrading loss 
ratios due to increases in such costs as minimum wage allowances and 
repair fees, the direct premiums written demonstrated a 5.1% YoY growth 
to reach KRW 17.5 trillion as auto insurance premium rates rose in the first 
half of the year. KB Insurance expanded its sales primarily through direct 
channels, and this raised its new sales from direct premiums by 8.4% YoY 
to KRW 2,206.5 billion and its market share inched up from the previous 
year to 12.6%. In the face of rate increases, our car insurance loss ratio 
rose by 3.7%p YoY to 92.0% in line with the cumulative effects caused 
by costs increases in minimum wage allowances and repair fees. Going 
forward, we aim to reinforce our underwriting competency, secure fair 
and reasonable prices, and improve our claim efficiency to continuously 
control our loss ratio.KB Insurance063General Insurance 
In 2019, the general insurance market grew by 5.5% YoY to KRW 6.2 
trillion based on the direct premiums written. The Korean market 
increased by 4.7% YoY to KRW 5.7 trillion and the overseas market by 
14.4% YoY to KRW 517.3 billion. Our sales based on the direct premiums 
written increased by 5.4% YoY to KRW 981.7 billion, and our prompt 
response to the governmental regulation to make liability insurance 
mandatory in more areas allowed us to rank top in elevator liability 
insurance and data privacy liability insurance sales. As our loss ratio rose 
by 4.6%p YoY to reach 75.6%, the ESS(Energy Storage System) fire that 
occurred in Korea along with other factors set us back considerably. We 
plan to manage our loss ratio through the proactive risk management 
of large-size contracts and improve our portfolio with a focus on high-
quality properties.Asset Management
Our AUM grew by 6.1% YoY to KRW 29 trillion as of the end of 2019, 
with our investment income increasing by KRW 175 billion YoY to KRW 
959 billion and our return on investment 3.46%. We follow the barbell 
asset management strategy to pursue profitability while managing 
asset/liability duration. In line with the adoption of K-ICS and other 
tightening capital adequacy regulations, our new investments are 
focused on profitable real estate and SOC-related assets and swaps are 
utilized to improve our returns on asset management. This will surely 
enable us to expand our asset duration through the purchase of long-
term bonds, relieve the burden of required capital with the decreasing 
ratio of risk assets, and minimize decreases in returns caused by a 
longer asset duration. Furthermore, investment limits are set in advance 
by asset type to manage the profitability and stability of assets under 
management while rigorous risk management is practiced including 
asset-specific limit management to secure stable returns.Risk Management
KB Insurance manages its capital efficiency and profitability through 
performing capital allocations based on internal capital by business 
area in order to systematically support the development of a risk-based 
performance culture. Periodical monitoring is conducted to ensure that 
the company-wide risk appetite remains at an appropriate level against 
available capital. Quarterly Risk Management Committee meetings 
are held to make decisions on major risk-related issues while monthly 
Risk Management Council meetings are hosted to discuss the current 
status and necessary improvements to be made on major issues by 
business area including general insurance, long-term insurance, and car 
insurance.We systematically and independently performed Own Risk and Solvency 
Assessments(ORSA) to earn exceptional scores in all of the eight 
sectors and be chosen as one of the best practices under the ORSA 
operational status reviews conducted by the Financial Supervisory 
Service last June on the insurance industry.Commitment to Greater Customer Convenience 
KB Insurance leads the industry through a differentiated customer 
experience enabled by digital innovation. As the most distinguished 
insurer in the field of insurtech, we became the first in the industry 
in 2018 to unveil the ‘easy premiums claim service’, and moved on tolaunch an integrated tailor-made mobile app and initiate ‘You Self 
Claim’ as a self-directed insurance payment system in 2019 to leverage 
our digital competitive edge to improve customer convenience. Going 
forward, we will create a digital ecosystem with startups and ICT 
businesses to offer differentiated services in order to solidify our status 
as an insurance provider that grows hand-in-hand with customers in 
the digital financial environment.Plans for 2020 
In line with increasing loss ratios across the industry as a whole and 
overall intensifying competition regarding high-risk products, the 
domestic insurance market is forecast to experience abrupt changes 
in 2020 including but not limited to growing financial risks caused by 
shifting external conditions(interest rates and FX) and an accelerated 
digitalization of the financial industry. In response, KB Insurance will 
continue to focus on customers and values in business conduct and on 
the following strategic priorities by business area.In long-term insurance, we will improve our product structure to move 
away from low-profit products, tighten loss ratio management through 
contract management, and expand business growth mainly on such 
strategic revenue-generating products as health insurance packages 
and auto insurance in order to build a stable profit base. Furthermore, 
we will upgrade the entire product-underwriting-claim value chain to 
improve on our mortality profit and other claim efficiency indicators 
while migrating to digitally-based customer-centric product/business 
processes to enhance work efficiency and increase profitability.We aim to secure price fairness in auto insurance by strengthening our 
underwriting capability while adjusting premium rates by customer and 
property and to pursue phased-in premium increases. We will launch 
new on-demand products, respond to the aggregator market, and 
reinforce collaboration with platform and fintech businesses to improve 
customer convenience and build a differentiated competitive edge.In general insurance, we will focus on our key channel – corporate sales 
channel – to increase sales from profitable and high-quality property/
liability insurance products, and also use varying channels spanning 
planners, agencies, and direct channels to broaden our stable profit 
base. This will go hand-in-hand with developing new products to target 
new markets and platform business and strengthening cross sales with 
other subsidiaries to bolster our sales base.Smart App Award Korea 2019No.1Won the ‘Grand Prize in the

in 2018, KB Kookmin Card also unveiled ‘KB Kookmin Deun Deun 
Livelihood Loan 2’ in 2019 that offers mid-range interest rates to its 
credit card holders in an aim to help low-income individuals ease their

customers reduce their interest rate burden through its differentiated

income groups with wide-ranging financial services to proactively 
respond to the government’s inclusive finance policy.Assigned ‘A-‘ rating by Fitch for three consecutive years 
We were assigned ‘A-‘ long-term credit ratings by Fitch for three 
consecutive years, and ‘A2’ by Moody’s in June 2019. This makes us 
the highest-rated specialized credit finance business in Korea, and 
this can be attributed to our continued efforts towards diversification 
to generate stable results amid decreasing merchant fees and other 
challenging business conditions and to our contribution to group-level 
synergy generation as a key subsidiary of KB Financial Group based on 
our stable growth potential and profitability.Initiating connected car pilot service through Hi-pass
Through our partnership with ‘Owin’, a connected car solution 
provider, we launched a connected car pilot service enabled by Hi-pass 
digital electronic cards. As part of the ‘financial regulatory testbed’ 
initiative led by the Korean Financial Services Commission for financial 
institutions to be commissioned the right to use new financial services 
developed by startups and innovators to conduct pilot operations, 
this service allows users to register their car ID granted through the 
digital electronic Hi-pass card as well as user/vehicle/payment card 
information on ‘Owin Pick’, a connected car service mobile application. 
It then allows users to receive onboard assistance in placing location-
based orders and making automatic payments through Bluetooth 
Low Energy. We plan to operate this pilot service and continue with 
follow-up work for its full-fledged release.Signing the SPA to acquire PT. Financia Multi Finance  
of Indonesia 
In November 2019, we signed a share purchase agreement with  
‘PT Finansia Multi Finance’, an Indonesian specialized credit finance 
business offering installment financing for automobiles, motorbikes and 
consumer goods. Multi finance companies are capable of selling local 
currency-related loan products – installment finance, lease, factoring, 
and housing mortgages – and conducting credit card business. Our planKB Kookmin Card065is to acquire its 80% stake at USD 81.3 million (nearly KRW 9.5 billion) 
owned by PEFs, and officially transform the company into our second 
overseas subsidiary in the 2nd half of 2020 following approval by the 
financial authorities and post-merger integration. We aim to assist 
PT Finansia Multi Finance in evolving into a specialized credit finance 
business with products and services ranging from consumer goods 
installment finance to credit card operations: its installment finance 
business will be diversified through the continued transfer of our 
product development, risk management and digital core capabilities, 
and its card operation will be initiated including card processing agency 
business.Becoming the 1st card company to receive the Presidential 
Award for exceptional labor relations  
Kookmin Card became the first-ever card company to be honored 
with the Presidential Award at the ‘Labor-Management Culture Awards 
2019’ in recognition of its contribution to establishing exemplary labor 
relations and a win-win labor-management culture.Supervised by the Ministry of Employment and Labor and the 
Korea Labor Development Foundation, the awards serves to reward 
businesses and organizations for practicing a win-win labor culture, 
and awardees are determined through documentary/on-site reviews 
and case study presentations out of the businesses granted ‘Labor-
Management Culture Top Performer’ certificates. Once awarded, these 
businesses become eligible for wide-ranging administrative/financial 
benefits including the exemption from regular work supervision for 
three years.While KB Kookmin Card, following its establishment in 2011, suffered 
conflicts as labor-management confrontations on major issues resulted 
in repetitive labor dispute arbitration procedures executed by the 
National Labor Relations Commission, it has been positively evaluated 
in recent years for developing win-win labor relations through a range 
of mutual communication programs and for endeavoring to practice an 
advanced labor-management culture.Notably, proactive steps have been taken to improve negotiation 
practices, from setting reasonable rules between labor and 
management and sharing negotiation agendas in advance to honoring 
simple promises, sharing review materials and hosting regular working-
level workshops. The sum of such endeavors has led to the creation of 
outstanding labor relations.The joint labor-management activity program ‘Harmony Created 
Together by KB Kookmin Card Labor and Management’ also allowed us 
to facilitate communication and to join hands in attending labor-related 
academic training and diverse social contribution programs, which 
highlighted our efforts to strengthen mutual cooperation and earned 
us high scores accordingly.Plans for 2020
While the growth of the card market turns sluggish due to worsening 
economic conditions and withering consumer confidence, we are 
encountering new competitive threats including the rapid emergence 
of fintech companies. As we recognize all such changes in the business 
landscape as a turning point to take a renewed step forward, we will 
follow the below three directions in actively conducting all our business 
initiatives.First, we will take a back to ‘basics’ approach that focuses on our 
customers. We will perform detailed analyses of all our processes that 
occur in the customer use of our products and services and utilize their 
outcomes to continuously deliver innovative customer services.Second, we will set ourselves apart from the competition with our top-
notch digital capabilities. To keep pace with the ICT evolution, we will 
continue to embrace new technologies while taking a fresh perspective 
in identifying market and consumer trends and leading the industry.Third, we will continuously expand the scope of our new business. 
Leveraging the existing card business base and data as well as wide-
ranging assets, we will broaden our new business in Korea and abroad 
and diversify our profit base.Card Transaction Volume

Such endeavors resulted in noteworthy investment outcomes mainly 
in China and Vietnam in 2019: our Chinese equity funds reached KRW 
1.6 trillion in AUM and our internal management size rose by 20% YoY 
to KRW 770.0 billion as of the end of 2019. In Vietnam, we became the

our cumulative investments in photovoltaics(PV), wind farm, and other 
renewable energy sources amounted to KRW 1.5 trillion which enabled 
us to rank first in the industry. With our expertise in operating domestic 
infrastructure funds, we are also diversifying our investment destinations 
into overseas real estate and renewable energy. We made KRW 220 
billion-worth GIF(Global Infrastructure Fund) commitments in May 2019 
and increased our overseas infrastructure investments – energy infra 
projects in North America, PV generation in Spain, fund of funds in public 
affordable housing in the U.S., and mezzanine blind funds in Europe – 
to eventually raise the ratio of overseas investments out of the total 
alternative investments from nearly 19% at the end of 2018 to 28% at 
the end of 2019.Broadening the Korean equity ETF line-up
As of the end of 2019, our ETF net asset value amounted to KRW 3.0

line-up and a fund inflow mainly into new ETFs. In 2019, 12 new ETF 
offerings were listed to scale up our product line-up to 73 in total.Plans for 2020
In 2020, we plan to boost our marketing campaign on the existing 
equity funds and pension funds as a way to facilitate the public 
offering fund market while addressing shifting market conditions 
swiftly and flexibly by reinforcing our product line-up with a focus 
on overseas asset allocation funds. Furthermore, we will continue to 
closely collaborate with global fund managers to further develop our 
management competency and continue with our innovative digital 
strategy to reinforce our quant-based management capabilities and 
focus on non-face-to-face channel marketing to keep pace with 
technological changes in the 4th Industrial Revolution era.In alternative investments, we aim to diversify our investment assets 
and the counties in which we provide them to, and expand our overseas 
infrastructure business to offer institutional investors varying profit-
generation opportunities. Furthermore, we will proactively explore new 
products in the areas of domestic infrastructure and real estate to cater 
to the needs of individual investors.KB CapitalKB CapitalKB Capital’s total assets rose by 17.5% YoY to KRW 11.2 trillion

leveraging our customer segment analysis platform to perform wide-
ranging analysis. As part of our digital marketing programs designed to 
secure future financial customers, online customer touchpoints were 
broadened by creating social network marketing channels. We also 
executed influencer marketing to target the millennial population.Responding to changes in the regulatory environment
With the continued implementation of the IFRS17 system development 
project, a stable infrastructure and a management decision-making 
support system were established while our RBC level has remained 
above the set target through the sustained duration extension of the 
assets before the adoption of the Korean Insurance Capital Standard 
(K-ICS). Furthermore, we make use of varying methods to promote 
internal modeling-based risk management and assist value-driven 
product development through the reflection of the new K-ICS and risk 
factor segmentation and improvement.Driving digital transformation 
Our Smart Work Place initiative allowed us to create a mobile work 
environment, and we endeavored tirelessly to bring innovation to 
our value chain by establishing a data analysis system based on the 
DB targeting model, leveraging Robotics Process Automation to 
improve work processes, and developing a Smart UW System. Building 
a collaborative ecosystem with fintech businesses, we are also 
broadening our ecosystem.Plans for 2020
As a business in the life insurance market, we witness continued 
concerns over the profitability and growth potential of the insurance 
industry itself due to low growth, low interest rates and other 
unfavorable business conditions. Furthermore, the spread of high tech-
based digital platforms is imposing numerous changes upon the overall 
financial industry. The insurance industry is also challenged with the 
introduction of IFRS17 and K-ICS, the tightening business regulations 
put in place to protect customers, and systemic and regulatory changes 
concerning business expenses and solicitation commissions. All these 
prompted KB Life Insurance to establish the following strategic steps.First, our growth will be driven by our customers. We will rigorously 
analyze the data we collect regarding our customers and markets 
to constantly deliver products that truly meet the needs of our 
customers, and we will solidify our brand image as an insurer who truly 
puts customers first. Second, we will proactively respond to market 
and system changes to pursue quality and value-driven growth while 
fortifying our corporate value by improving management efficiency 
from the long-term perspective. Third, we will seek digitally-driven 
innovation to strengthen the user experience and optimize our value 
chain and data analytics system. This will undoubtedly expand our 
presence within the digital ecosystem as a business that wholeheartedly 
values customers.KB Real Estate Trust069KB Real Estate TrustKB Real Estate Trust became the first in the industry to launch

focus on profitable project undertakings as a way to secure a stable 
profit base. Notably in the trust business, we endeavor to increase 
orders awarded for completion guarantee management land trust 
projects that are executed on an advanced business structure as well 
as profitable leveraged land trust projects. Our profit base is also being 
diversified through low-risk collateral trusts and other non-land trust 
offerings.In the reconstruction business, we tender for profitable reconstruction 
projects and host promotional presentations to proactively conduct 
business, and are adopting diverse business models such as project 
agency and small-scale reconstruction in addition to the conventional 
project operation model to rebalance our business portfolio.As far as the REITs business goes, the ‘REITs Business Division’ was 
created in 2019 to improve the competitiveness of our REITs operations, 
and our investments were diversified into retail properties and logistics 
centers to generate greater business outcomes.In the risk management sector, periodic monitoring is performed 
on preemptive response processes developed in preparation for 
emergencies and on product-specific limit runout rates while phase-
based progress reviews are made on major parts of the projects being 
implemented to manage risks preemptively.Plans for 2020
It is expected that the year 2020 will witness a deepening economic 
slowdown and continued downturn in the real estate market in Korea 
while the entry of new trust firms will further intensify competition in 
the real estate trust market. As such, KB Real Estate Trust will practice 
risk management based on product-specific risk factors and take swift 
and company-wide actions to address the pending issues of respective 
projects so as to solidify its proactive risk management system and 
push forward with digitalization to maximize business efficiency.In the reconstruction business, we will ensure we obtain governmental 
official designation as either a project operator or a project agent 
on the projects we are currently working on, and increase our orders 
granted by respective business execution models in order to improve 
our performance. In the REITs business, we will diversify our investment 
portfolio and upgrade investment operations while diversifying the 
profit portfolio by participating in public biddings and launching wide-
ranging property-based REITs products. Furthermore, we will advance 
our REITs operations to increase the value of REITs assets and maximize 
our operational outcomes through successful asset sales.070KB Savings BankIn 2019, KB Savings Bank posted KRW 16.3 billion in net income

The KB Savings Bank’s mobile banking app is the first in the 
financial industry to deliver the ‘voice service’ enabled by non-FIDO 
authentication and the ‘mobile certificate’ function that uses QR codes 
to ascertain the authenticity of certificates. Our innovative mobile 
banking improved the UI/UX for greater customer convenience and 
increased the speed of log-ins and screen transition times to the 
highest-possible level in the industry. With the goal of creating a user-
centric financial platform, we elevated security performance based 
on our philosophy of ‘Secure, Simple, and Speedy’, adopted a simple 
certification technique to increase service accessibility and utility, 
and achieved the highest-possible transaction speed in the financial 
industry through the rearrangement of security solutions and the 
improvement of transaction modes.In 2020, we plan to leverage digital transformation to unveil our mobile 
banking services powered by a number of new technologies. We also 
aim to deliver even greater benefits to the working class by providing 
digital finance services for those who find it difficult to visit our brickand mortar branches. This allows for easy and convenient access to 
these financial services by reducing business costs which will keep our 
loan interest rates low and deposit interest rates high.New Products and Most-Popular Products & Services 
We offer wide-ranging financial products that cater to customer 
needs, from our flagship mid-range interest rate loan ‘KB Kind Loan’ 
to the Korea Inclusive Finance Agency’s ‘Sunshine Loan’ and the 
Seoul Guarantee Insurance Company’s ‘Saitdol 2’. In so doing, we 
not only help the working class build their assets but also serve as an 
intermediary in enabling low-credit customers, who are otherwise 
unable to get approved for loans at commercial banks, to benefit from 
the regulated financial system.In May 2019, we launched the gamification product ‘KB Honey Savings’ 
to expand the territory of our business. This daily installment savings 
product comes with a 100-day maturity and offers up to 55,000 Liiv 
Mate points in addition to a 2.2% annual base rate. The Liiv Mate points 
are accumulated when the account holder plays the ‘Cham Cham 
Cham’ game following a daily automatic transfer, recommends this 
product to others, or opens his/her account. This product was named 
based on the idea generated through Gig, a voluntary idea suggestion 
meeting attended by KB Savings Bank employees, and we plan to 
launch diverse digital products that allow customers to experience 
saving money through such an amusing platform.*Gig: The term originates in jazz music and is the name of KB Savings Bank’s 
in-house employee meeting organized voluntarily to meet specific purposes.Becoming the First in the Industry to Achieve the ISO37001 
Anti-Bribery Management Certification 
We became the first in the industry to achieve the ISO37001 
international anti-bribery management certification in 2018, and 
have since maintained our certification through annual assessments 
in 2019. Our strong commitment and endeavors to establish and 
implement a practical and detailed anti-bribery management system 
were highly recognized, which include but are not limited to thorough 
financial policy compliance, mandatory integrity training, strengthened 
disciplinary standards, the proactive identification and improvement 
of anti-bribery risk factors at the department level, and internal 
evaluations and management reviews led by anti-bribery compliance 
managers. This represents a best practice on anti-bribery management 
in the savings bank industry, and we are strengthening our anti-bribery 
and integrity promotion activities.Plans for 2020 
KB Savings Bank will become a ‘Clean Bank’ through preemptive risk 
management and an industry-leading digital bank through the offering 
of differentiated digital customer experiences. To realize this vision, we 
will 1) deliver mobile banking services that offer the greatest-possible 
benefits and convenience to customers, 2) efficiently reallocate our 
human resources through process automation to pursue cost efficiency 
and productivity gains, 3) rebuild our credit rating model to broaden 
the credit spectrum of our mid-range interest rate loan portfolio, and 4) 
advance our IT infrastructure to ensure long-term growth.KB Investment071KB InvestmentIn 2019, KB Investment launched KRW 220.0 billion-worth large 
venture funds as well as new venture funds valued at KRW 275.0 
billion in total, which raised its investments by 36.8% from the 
previous year. Its venture fund AUM surpassed the KRW 1 trillion

Reinforcement Strategy 
Driven by the Korean government’s venture business promotion policy, 
annual venture investments in the venture investment market surged 
by 25% from 2018 to reach nearly KRW 4.2 trillion in 2019, setting a new 
record in the venture investments made. With newly-formed venture 
capitals amounting to KRW 4.1 trillion, both fund creation and new 
investment witnessed rapid growth.The number of new venture capital increased by 16 year on year 
and a record-high number of venture funds was created this year, 
competition has intensified in organizing funds and identifying deals. 
These circumstances prompted KB Investment to strengthen its 
collaboration with group subsidiaries in creating large-size venture 
funds while reinforcing investment in and promotion of new growth 
industries and overseas investment destinations.Large-size Funds and Subsidiary Collaboration Funds    In May 2019, 
KB Investment launched a KRW 220.0 billion large-scale KB Global 
Platform Fund in conjunction with KB Kookmin Bank, KB Securities, KB 
Insurance, KB Capital, and KB Kookmin Card, and made investments in 
the global market based on the funds raised.PEFs and Specialty Venture Funds  KB Investment created the 
‘KB CAPE No.1’ fund with KRW 19.3 billion in total commitments in 
cooperation with CAPE Investment & Securities to invest KRW 18.8 
billion in ‘TNK Factory’s redeemable convertible preferred stocks. In 
addition, We created the KB Culture & Global Digital Contents Fund 
valued at KRW 40 billion to invest in domestic/overseas cultural digital 
content businesses. In addition, the KRW 15 billion KB Social Impact 
Investment Fund was launched to invest in social enterprises.Nurturing New Growth Industries and Making Overseas Investments    
We increased our investments in new growth industries: our ICT service 
investment posted a whopping 270% increase from KRW 37.1 billion 
in 2018 to KRW 137.1 billion in 2019, and our investment in the bio 
and health care sectors also surged by 114% from KRW 29.7 billion in 
2018 to KRW 63.7 billion in 2019. Meanwhile, our Seed and Series A 
investments rose by 49% from KRW 47.2 billion in 2018 to KRW 70.1 
billion in 2019, and our overseas investments skyrocketed by 489% 
from KRW 16.0 billion in 2018 to KRW 94.2 billion in 2019.In 2019, KB Investment’s fund assets under management, including 
PEFs, increased by KRW 294 billion from the previous year to reach 
KRW 1,303 billion, and its investments also set a new record high at 
KRW 267.9 billion.Plans for 2020 
KB Investment will continue with its mid to long-term growth strategy 
to nurture talented employees and strengthen its investment capacity 
with an aim to move beyond being a top-tier venture capital business 
into the Most Influential Venture Capital within three years. We will 
also further broaden our global presence to establish a balanced 
investment portfolio and lay the basis for mid to long-term growth.072KB Data SystemsKB Data Systems reached KRW 41.7 billion in total assets, up by 
3.7% from the previous year, and net income posted KRW 4.7 
billion, up by 62.1% from the previous year, while sales posted 
a 20.3% YoY growth to KRW 158.1 billion in line with increasing 
group-level IT investments. KB Data Systems is also supporting

under the The K ProjectReaping success in building a next-generation system  
for group subsidiaries
In 2019, we successfully completed the development of a next-
generation card system, and redeveloped the call center system under 
the KB Kookmin Bank’s “The K” Project. Furthermore, our professional 
developers took an active role in the information system and data hub 
businesses. As intensifying competition against internet-only banks 
and fintech businesses led to the growth of non-face-to-face channels 
and new IT-related business, KB Data Systems proactively joined the 
IT businesses conducted in digitally-driven core areas on the group 
level to assist KB Financial Group’s digital strategy and accelerate its 
digitalization.Generating synergy through joint group-level  
IT system development 
We developed IT systems that could be shared among group 
subsidiaries, including integrated internal controls for financial 
reporting and an integrated certificate platform while operating a joint 
group-wide IT system from WiseNet(group portal system) and open 
APIs to help improve the IT efficiency of KB Financial Group. In business 
operations, KB Insurance’s IT system operation was transferred to 
KB Data Systems to enable us to secure expertise in serving the IT 
operational service needs of the group and to extend the scope of 
these services into other subsidiaries in the savings bank and capital 
sectors. In line with the increasing demand for group-level operational 
business and SI development, our workforce expanded from 413 to 484 
employees on a YoY basis, and the widened scope of our operational 
service support for insurance, card, capital and other non-banking 
subsidiaries demonstrates our commitment to providing balanced IT 
services at the group level.Creating Digital IT Business Unit and internalizing  
digital competency 
In 2019, Digital IT Business Unit was created to help us serve as a digital 
and IT hub within KB Financial Group and support its wide-ranging 
digital-related IT services. We participated in developing the strategy to 
assist the group’s savings bank business in migrating to digital banking, 
and adopted DevOps-based agile development methodology(CI/CD) 
in supporting the cloud-driven hybrid financing(CLAYON) business, 
thereby internalizing digital capabilities and broadening the width of 
our IT service offerings.Plans for 2020 
In response to KB Kookmin Bank’s “The K” Project and KB Financial 
Group’s digital innovation, KB Data Systems will recruit top performers 
and invest these top-notch human resources in a timely manner to 
assist the successful completion of the group’s next-generation system 
development. In hybrid financing, we will strengthen collaboration on 
major group-level businesses – particularly Cloud platform business and 
life-style financing(Liiv) business – to help generate synergy in the IT 
sector while securing and internalizing exceptional digital capabilities to 
grow into a provider of IT services that truly satisfies customer needs.KB Credit Information073KB Credit InformationIn 2019, KB Credit Information posted an approximately 8.8%  
growth in sales to KRW 38.3 billion, and its total assets rose 
by nearly 6% to KRW 27.8 billion. While financial institutions 
strengthened their asset quality this year to negatively impact 
the amount of debts managed by credit information businesses, 
this also helped to maintain a low level of delinquency ratio 
and non-performing loans on the part of financial institutions 
from the long-term view point, contributing to managing asset 
quality at the group level.Total Assets

in annual debt collectionImproving the Efficiency and Competitiveness of  
Debt Collection 
KB Credit Information proactively recruited top-performing debt 
collectors in the areas of banking and card debts, operated an 
adequate performance management system, and strengthened its 
management system by type of debt in order to maximize group-level 
debt collection and recovery, and these multi-pronged endeavors 
allowed us to significantly increase the efficiency and competitiveness 
of our debt collection business. In 2019, we posted relatively robust 
performance in the face of worsening business conditions with our debt 
collection sales and group-level debt recovery reaching KRW nearly 
28.2 billion and KRW 322.2 billion respectively. We also continuously 
extended our group-level business areas by supporting KB Kookmin 
Card’s credit recovery business, accepting KB Capital’s delinquent 
debts, and increasing the commission of bank debts.By type of debt, the amount of delinquent debts we retrieved was KRW 
154.1 billion at KB Kookmin Bank, KRW 159.7 billion at KB Kookmin 
Card, and KRW 8.9 billion at KB Insurance, KB Capital, and KB Savings 
Bank, which allowed us to remain above KRW 320 billion in annual debt 
collection just as we had last year.As outstanding debt collectors are the key to our debt collection 
business, one of our top priorities for 2019 was to recruit these top-
performing individuals. A total of 75 professional debt collectors were 
hired in the bank and card debt areas. The majority of these collectors 
outperformed their colleagues which served to affirm our expectation 
that their services will play a pivotal role for KB Credit Information in 
building a stronger competitive edge.In lease investigation, our sales reached nearly KRW 9.5 billion, and 
we did our best to advance into diverse businesses derived from 
these investigations by continuing to accept title search work from 
KB Insurance and preparing a bid at the Korea Asset Management 
Corporation.Plans for 2020 
In 2020, the economic slowdown is forecast to continue due to 
external/internal uncertainties and debtors’ moral hazard is also 
expected to aggravate in line with governmental support for the 
underprivileged, which prompted KB Credit Information to further 
reinforce its competitive edge as a debt collector in order to improve 
group-wide asset quality as its top priority. Our management system 
will be bolstered by type of debt and group-level debt collection 
will be maximized while proactive responses will be made to address 
declining debt volume. Meanwhile, we continue to explore new 
sources of revenue – KB Insurance, KB Capital, KB Savings Bank, and 
a business derived from lease investigations. We intend to strengthen 
our business competency through an advanced IT system and improve 
our organizational productivity through appropriate organizational and 
workforce operations while continuously tightening the management 
of delinquent customers in Korea in line with financial consumer 
protection regulations.074Financial 
SectionConsolidated  
Financial StatementsSeparate Financial  
Statements075256075Independent Auditor’s Report(English Translation of a Report Originally Issued in Korean)To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of KB Financial Group Inc.Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of KB Financial Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Group”), 
which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the consolidated statements of comprehensive 
income, consolidated statements of changes in equity and consolidated statements of cash flows for the years then ended, and notes to the consolidated 
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group 
as at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the Republic of Korea (Korean IFRS).Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audits in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the 
ethical requirements of the Republic of Korea that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with the ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion.Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.1. Expected Credit Losses on Loans Measured at Amortized CostWhy it is determined to be a key audit matter :
The impairment guidance under Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments requires determination of significant increases in credit risk and measurement of 
expected credit losses using forward-looking information and others. Accordingly, the Group developed a new measurement model utilizing various types 
of information, which requires a higher level of management’s interpretation and judgment.The Group measures expected credit losses on loans measured at amortized cost, on an individual or collective basis. The identification of loans that 
are deteriorating and the assessment of the present value of expected future cash flows in determining expected credit losses are inherently uncertain, 
involving various assumptions and judgment. In measuring expected losses on a collective basis, a wide range of complex inputs and assumptions are used. 
Given the extent of judgment involved, we considered expected credit losses to be a key audit matter.Loans measured at amortized cost subject to individual or collective assessment are ₩ 342,092,076 million, with loan loss allowances of ₩ 2,408,016 
million, as of December 31, 2019(See Note 4-2, 10, 11). In addition, unused commitments and guarantees are ₩ 163,972,499 million, with related provisions 
of ₩ 291,970 million as of December 31, 2019(See Note 4-2, 23, 40). Significantly affected subsidiaries are Kookmin Bank and KB Kookmin Card.076How our audit addressed the key audit matter :(1) Assessment of expected credit losses on an individual basis
We obtained an understanding and evaluated the processes and controls relating to the assessment of expected credit losses on an individual basis. In 
particular, we focused our effort on the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows. We evaluated whether management’s estimation was reasonable 
and we assessed the key assumptions in the cash flow projection including growth rate of entities subject to individual assessment and valuation of 
collateral. As part of these procedures, we assessed whether sales growth rate, operating income ratio, and assumptions on investment activities were 
consistent with historical performance and current market conditions. Furthermore, we assessed the appropriateness of collateral valuation by conducting 
our own research on recent property prices and engaged independent appraisal specialists in assessing reasonableness of appraisal reports, models and 
methodologies used by management.(2) Assessment of expected credit losses on a collective basis
We obtained an understanding and evaluated the processes and controls relating to management’s calculation of expected credit losses on a collective 
basis in accordance with impairment requirements under Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments. As explained in Note 2, management assesses credit 
ratings to recognize lifetime expected credit losses on loans with significant increase in credit risk and impaired loans. Other than these cases, management 
recognizes twelve-months of expected credit losses. To calculate all expected credit losses, management has applied forward-looking information, 
probability of default, loss given default, and other assumptions estimated through its internal procedures and controls implemented for various 
assumptions.We assessed the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to credit ratings that reasonably reflect both qualitative and quantitative 
information. Our testing over the accuracy and reliability of the information included agreeing qualitative and quantitative information with relevant 
evidence.We reviewed the appropriateness of management policies and procedures to determine significant increases in credit risk, and tested reasonableness of 
expected credit loss model applied by each of the three stages(Stage 1, 2 and 3) depending on how significantly credit risk was increased.Our audit involved risk specialists to statistically analyze the correlation between forward-looking information and probability of default or loss given 
default. We assessed the appropriateness of methodologies for adjusting the probability of default and loss given default to reflect forward-looking 
information on estimation of expected credit losses. We further tested the reasonableness and mathematical accuracy of the information through 
recalculation and inspection of supporting data.We reviewed the methodologies used by management to verify that probability of default and loss given default were calibrated using sufficient and 
reasonable historical data. We determined that the default and loss data used were appropriately gathered and applied in accordance with internal 
control procedures. In addition, we assessed reasonableness and accuracy of probability of default and loss given default through procedures including 
recalculation, and evaluated management’s default and loss data.2. Valuation of Over-The-Counter DerivativesWhy it is determined to be a key audit matter :
Fair value of large portion of over-the-counter derivatives in the consolidated financial statements is calculated through the use of an internally 
developed valuation system. Judgment is required in estimating the fair value of these derivatives held by KB Securities in determining appropriate models, 
assumptions and inputs. Given the extent of judgment involved in valuing these over-the-counter derivatives, we considered this to be a key audit matter. 
Over-the-counter derivatives of KB securities subject to fair value measurement amount to ₩ 14,444,557 million as of December 31, 2019, including 
financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss related to structured securities and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss(See 
Note 6).How our audit addressed the key audit matter :
We obtained an understanding and evaluated processes and controls in relation to fair value measurement. Our focus was particularly on the accuracy of 
underlying transaction data used and mathematical calculation in accordance with management’s internal valuation methodologies.We assessed design and tested operating effectiveness of controls over accuracy and completeness of key inputs such as underlying transaction data 
(notional amount, interest rate, maturity etc.) used in management’s determination of estimated fair value. We tested transaction data used in the valuation 
by examining supporting evidence including contracts and trade confirmations.077We also evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over periodic verification of management’s internal valuation system to 
ensure the valuation methodologies configured in the system were operating as intended. We involved our derivative valuation specialist to independently 
estimate fair values utilizing independent valuation models and variables to see if management’s valuation is outside our ranges.Other Matter
Auditing standards and their application in practice vary among countries. The procedures and practices used in the Republic of Korea to audit such 
consolidated financial statements may differ from those generally accepted and applied in other countries.Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Korean IFRS, and 
for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations.Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:·   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform 
audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.·   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, butnot for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control.·  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made bymanagement.·   Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.·   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether theconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.·   Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.078We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, 
and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report 
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Yeob Yu, Certified Public Accountant.Samil PricewaterhouseCoopersSeoul, Korea
March 5, 2020This report is effective as of March 5, 2020, the audit report date. Certain subsequent events or circumstances, which may occur between the audit report date and the time 
of reading this report, could have a material impact on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Accordingly, the readers of the audit report

KB Financial Group Inc. (the “Parent Company”) was incorporated on September 29, 2008, under the Financial Holding Companies Act of Korea. KB 
Financial Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) derive substantially all of their revenue and income from providing a broad range of banking and 
related financial services to consumers and corporations primarily in Korea and in selected international markets. The Parent Company’s principal business 
includes ownership and management of subsidiaries and associated companies that are engaged in financial services or activities. In 2011, Kookmin Bank 
spun off its credit card business segment and established a new separate credit card company, KB Kookmin Card Co., Ltd., and KB Investment & Securities 
Co., Ltd. merged with KB Futures Co., Ltd. The Group established KB Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in January 2012, acquired Yehansoul Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in 
September 2013, and KB Savings Bank Co., Ltd. merged with Yehansoul Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in January 2014. In March 2014, the Group acquired Woori 
Financial Co., Ltd. and changed the name to KB Capital Co., Ltd. Meanwhile, the Group included LIG Insurance Co., Ltd. as an associate and changed the 
name to KB Insurance Co., Ltd. in June 2015. Also, the Group included Hyundai Securities Co., Ltd. as an associate in June 2016 and included as a subsidiary 
in October 2016 by comprehensive exchange of shares. Hyundai Securities Co., Ltd. merged with KB Investment & Securities Co., Ltd. in December 2016 and 
changed the name to KB Securities Co., Ltd. in January 2017. KB Insurance Co., Ltd. became one of the subsidiaries through a tender offer in May 2017.The Parent Company’s share capital as of December 31, 2019, is ₩ 2,090,558 million. The Parent Company has been listed on the Korea Exchange (“KRX”) 
since October 10, 2008, and on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) for its American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) since September 29, 2008. Number of 
shares authorized in its Articles of Incorporation is 1,000 million.2. Basis of Preparation
2.1 Application of Korean IFRSThe Group maintains its accounting records in Korean won and prepares statutory financial statements in the Korean language (“Hangeul”) in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the Republic of Korea (“Korean IFRS”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements 
have been condensed, restructured and translated into English from the Korean language financial statements.Certain information attached to the Korean language financial statements, but not required for a fair presentation of the Group's financial position, financial 
performance or cash flows, is not presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Korean IFRS. These are the standards, subsequent amendments 
and related interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") that have been adopted by the Republic of Korea.The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. Management also needs to exercise 
judgment in applying the Group’s accounting policies.  The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and 
estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 2.4.The Group recognized an amount of services to customers as expenses in previous consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income but recognized 
as the reduction of revenue in accordance with Korean IFRS 1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Accordingly, certain accounts reported in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018 have been reclassified to facilitate the comparison with the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31. 2019. The reclassification of the accounts does not have any effect on 
the net asset value or profit for the period of the Group as reported in the year ended December 31, 2018.2.1.1 New and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the GroupThe Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual reporting period commencing January 1, 2019.-Enactment of Korean IFRS 1116 LeasesKorean IFRS 1116 Leases, the new standard, replaces Korean IFRS 1017 Leases. Under the new standard, with implementation of a single lease model, 
lessee is required to recognize assets and liabilities for all lease which lease term is over 12 months and underlying assets are not low value assets. A lessee 
is required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.With implementation of Korean IFRS 1116 Lease, the Group has changed accounting policy. The Group has adopted Korean IFRS 1116 retrospectively, as087permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the standard and recognized the cumulative impact of initially applying the standard as at January 
1, 2019, the date of initial application. The Group has not restated comparatives for the 2018 reporting period. The impact of the adoption of the leasing 
standard and the new accounting policies are disclosed in Note 45.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1109 Financial InstrumentsThe narrow-scope amendments made to Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments enable entities to measure certain prepayable financial assets with 
negative compensation at amortized cost. When a modification of a financial liability measured at amortized cost that does not result in the derecognition, 
a modification gain or loss shall be recognized in profit or loss. The amendment does not have a significant impact on the financial statements.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1019 Employee BenefitsThe amendments require that an entity shall calculate current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the reporting period after a plan 
amendment, curtailment or settlement based on updated actuarial assumptions from the date of the change. The amendments also require that a 
reduction in a surplus must be recognized in profit or loss even if that surplus was not previously recognized because of the impact of the asset ceiling. The 
amendment does not have a significant impact on the financial statements.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1028 Investments in Associates and Joint VenturesThe amendments clarify that an entity shall apply Korean IFRS 1109 to financial instruments in an associate or joint venture to which the equity method is 
not applied. These include long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the entity’s net investment in an associate or joint venture. The amendment 
does not have a significant impact on the financial statements.- Enactment of Interpretation of Korean IFRS 2123 Uncertainty over Income Tax TreatmentsThe enactment clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes in the event that the decision of taxation authorities or courts can change tax 
treatment. The enactment presents calculating methods of disclosure amount based on the possibility of future recognition of the income tax treatment 
and requires disclosure of the uncertainty of the amount. The enactment does not have a significant impact on the financial statements.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments, and 1107 Financial Instruments: DisclosureThese amendments provide exceptions applying hedge accounting even though interest rate benchmark reform gives rise to uncertainties. In the hedging 
relationship, an entity shall assume that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedge cash flows are based is not altered as a result of interest rate 
benchmark reform when determining whether a forecast transaction is highly probable and prospectively assessing hedging effectiveness. For a hedge of 
a non-contractually specified benchmark component of interest rate risk, an entity shall apply the requirement that the risk component shall be separately 
identifiable only at the inception of the hedging relationship. The application of this exception is ceased either when the uncertainty arising from interest 
rate benchmark reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedge item, 
or when the hedging relationship that the hedge item is part of is discontinued. These amendments will be effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2020. However, the Group early adopted the amendments as it is permitted. The significant benchmark interest rate indicator for the hedge 
relationship is LIBOR, and the hedge accounting in Note 9 directly affected by these amendments.- Annual Improvements to Korean IFRS 1103 Business CombinationThe amendments clarify that when a party to a joint arrangement obtains control of a business that is a joint operation and had rights to the assets and 
obligations for the liabilities relating to that joint operation immediately before the acquisition date, the transaction is a business combination achieved 
in stages. In such cases, the acquirer shall remeasure its entire previously held interest in the joint operation. The amendment does not have a significant 
impact on the financial statements.- Annual Improvements to Korean IFRS 1111 Joint AgreementsThe amendments clarify that when a party that participates in, but does not have joint control of, a joint operation might obtain joint control of the 
joint operation in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business. In such cases, previously held interests in the joint operation are not 
remeasured. The amendment does not have a significant impact on the financial statements.- Annual Improvements to Paragraph 57A of Korean IFRS 1012 Income TaxThe amendment is applied to all the income tax consequences of dividends and requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of dividends in 
profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity according to where the entity originally recognized those past transactions or events. The amendment 
does not have a significant impact on the financial statements.- Annual Improvements to Korean IFRS 1023 Borrowing CostThe amendments clarify that if a specific borrowing remains outstanding after the related qualifying asset is ready for its intended use (or sale), it becomes 
part of general borrowings. The amendment does not have a significant impact on the financial statements.0882.1.2 New and amended standards and interpretations not yet adopted by the GroupCertain new accounting standards and interpretations that have been published but are not mandatory for the reporting period commencing January 1, 
2019 and have not been early adopted by the Group are set out below.-  Amendments to Korean IFRS 1001 Presentation of Financial Statements and Korean IFRS 1008 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and 
errors – Definition of MaterialThe amendments clarify the explanation of the definition of material and amended Korean IFRS 1001 and Korean IFRS 1008 in accordance with the clarified 
definitions. Materiality is assessed by reference to omission or misstatement of material information as well as effects of immaterial information, and to the 
nature of the users when determining the information to be disclosed by the Group. These amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2020, and earlier application of permitted. The Group does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the financial 
statements.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1103 Business Combination – Definition of a BusinessTo consider the integration of the required activities and assets as a business, the amended definition of a business requires an acquisition to include an 
input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs and excludes economic benefits from the lower costs. 
An entity can apply a concentration test, an optional test, where substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset 
or a group of similar assets, the assets acquired would not represent a business. These amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2020, and earlier application of permitted. The Group does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the financial 
statements.- IFRS Interpretation Committee’s agenda decisions - Lease TermOn December 16, 2019, the IFRS Interpretations Committee announced an interpretation of the “lease term and useful life of leasehold improvements”. 
This interpretation deals with how to determine the lease term of a cancellable lease or a renewable lease and whether the useful life of non-removable 
leasehold improvements is limited by the relevant lease term. According to this interpretation, the Group should identify factors to consider the broader 
economic penalty, reflect identified factors to accounting policies, and calculate lease term again based on accounting policy.However, due to the large number of lease contracts held by the Group and varying terms of the contract, the Group determined that sufficient time would 
be required to set up items to be included in the review of extensive economic penalty and to establish procedures for collecting and analyzing necessary 
information. Therefore, the effect of the changes in accounting policy for the lease term is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the 
current reporting period.If the accounting policy for the lease term is changed in the annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020, the amount of the related right-of-use 
assets and lease liabilities may increase, and the consolidated financial statements may need to be retroactively restated to reflect this effect.2.2 Measurement BasisThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified.2.3 Functional and Presentation CurrencyItems included in the financial statements of each entity of the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
entity operates (“the functional currency”).  The consolidated financial statements are presented in Korean won, which is the Parent Company’s functional 
and presentation currency.2.4 Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions 
that may have a significant impact on the assets (liabilities) and incomes (expenses). Management’s estimates of outcomes may differ from actual outcomes 
if management’s estimates and assumptions based on management’s best judgment at the reporting date are different from the actual environment.Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and any change in an accounting estimate is recognized prospectively by including it in profit or loss 
in the period of the change, if the change affects that period only. Alternatively if the change in accounting estimate affects both the period of change and 
future periods, that change is recognized in the profit or loss of all those periods.Uncertainty in estimates and assumptions with significant risk that may result in material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements are as follows:0892.4.1 Income taxesThe Group is operating in numerous countries and the income generated from these operations is subject to income taxes based on tax laws and 
interpretations of tax authorities in numerous jurisdictions.  There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain.If certain portion of the taxable income is not used for investments, increase in wages, and others in accordance with the Tax System for Promotion of 
Investment and Collaborative Cooperation (Recirculation of Corporate Income), the Group is liable to pay additional income tax calculated based on the 
tax laws. The new tax system is effective for three years from 2018.  Accordingly, the measurement of current and deferred income tax is affected by the 
tax effects from the new system. As the Group’s income tax is dependent on the investments, increase in wages, and others, there exists uncertainty with 
regard to measuring the final tax effects.2.4.2 Fair value of financial instrumentsThe fair value of financial instruments where no active market exists or where quoted prices are not otherwise available is determined by using valuation 
techniques.  Financial instruments, which are not actively traded in the market and those with less transparent market prices, will have less objective fair 
values and require broad judgment on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty in market factors and assumptions in price determination and other risks.As described in the significant accounting policies in Note 3.3, ‘Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments’, diverse valuation techniques are 
used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, from generally accepted market valuation models to internally developed valuation models that 
incorporate various types of assumptions and variables.2.4.3 Provisions for credit lossesThe Group tests impairment and recognizes allowances for losses on financial assets classified at amortized cost, debt instruments measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income and lease receivables through impairment testing and recognizes provisions for guarantees, and unused loan 
commitments. Accuracy of provisions for credit losses is dependent upon estimation of expected cash flows of the borrower for individually assessed 
allowances of loans, and upon assumptions and methodology used for collectively assessed allowances for groups of loans, guarantees and unused loan 
commitments.2.4.4 Net defined benefit liabilityThe present value of net defined benefit liability depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions 
(Note 24).2.4.5 Impairment of goodwillThe recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations to test whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment (Note 15).3. Significant Accounting Policies
The significant accounting policies and calculation methods applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements have been consistently 
applied to all periods presented, except for the impact of changes due to enactment of new standards, amendments and interpretations disclosed in Note 2.1 
and the following paragraph.3.1 Consolidation3.1.1 SubsidiariesSubsidiaries are companies that are controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.  The existence and effects of potential 
voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.  Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date when control is transferred to the Group and de-consolidated from the date when control is lost.If a subsidiary uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar 
circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to make the subsidiary’s accounting policies conform to those of the Group when the subsidiary’s 
financial statements are used by the Group in preparing the consolidated financial statements.090Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Parent Company and to the non-controlling 
interests, if any.  Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the Parent Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in 
the non-controlling interests having a negative balance.Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions; that is, as transactions with the 
owners exercising their entitlement.  The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of 
net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.  Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change 
in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss.  The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained 
interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.  In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that 
entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.  Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive 
income are reclassified to profit or loss.The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations.  The consideration transferred is measured at the fair values of the assets 
transferred, and identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially measured at their fair 
values at the acquisition date.  The Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis in the event of 
liquidation, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognized amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets.  
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.In a business combination achieved in stages, the Group shall remeasure its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value 
and recognize the resulting gain or loss, if any, in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, as appropriate.  In prior reporting periods, the Group may 
have recognized changes in the value of its equity interest in the acquiree in other comprehensive income.  If so, the amount that was recognized in other 
comprehensive income shall be reclassified as profit or loss, or retained earnings, on the same basis as would be required if the Group had disposed directly 
of the previously held equity interest.The Group applies the book amount method to account for business combinations of entities under a common control. Identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their book amounts on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.  In addition, the 
difference between the sum of consolidated book amounts of the assets and liabilities transferred and accumulated other comprehensive income; and the 
consideration paid is recognized as capital surplus.3.1.2 Associates and joint venturesAssociates are entities over which the Group has significant influence in the financial and operating policy decisions. Generally, if the Group holds 20% to 
50% of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the Group has significant influence, it is presumed that the Group has significant influence.Joint ventures are investments in which the Group jointly controls over economic activities pursuant to contractual arrangement.  Decisions on financial 
and operating policies require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.Under the equity method, investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is increased or decreased 
to recognize the Group’s share of the profit or loss of the investee and changes in the investee’s equity after the date of acquisition.  The Group’s share 
of the profit or loss of the investee is recognized in the Group’s profit or loss.  Distributions received from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the 
investment.  Profit and loss resulting from ‘upstream’ and ‘downstream’ transactions between the Group and associates are eliminated to the extent at the 
Group’s interest in associates.  Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that 
there is no evidence of impairment.If associates and joint ventures uses accounting policies other than those of the Group for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, if 
necessary, adjustments shall be made to make the associate’s accounting policies conform to those of the Group when the associate’s financial statements 
are used by the entity in applying the equity method.If the Group’s share of losses of associates and joint ventures equals or exceeds its interest in the associate (including long-term interests that, in substance, 
form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate), the Group discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. After the Group’s interest is 
reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognized, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.The Group determines at each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the investments in the associates are impaired. If this is the 
case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associates and its carrying value and 
recognizes the amount as ‘non-operating income (expense)’ in the statement of comprehensive income.0913.1.3 Structured entityA structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity.  When 
the Group decides whether it has power to the structured entities in which the Group has interests, it considers factors such as the purpose, the form, the practical 
ability to direct the relevant activities of a structured entity, the nature of its relationship with a structured entity and the amount of exposure to variable returns.3.1.4 Trusts and fundsThe Group provides management services for trust assets, collective investment and other funds.  These trusts and funds are not consolidated in the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements, except for trusts and funds over which the Group has control.3.1.5 Intra-group transactionsAll intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized gains arising on intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated 
financial statements.  Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is 
no evidence of impairment.3.2 Foreign Currency3.2.1 Foreign currency transactionsA foreign currency transaction is recorded, on initial recognition in the functional currency, by applying the spot exchange rate between the functional 
currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting period, foreign currency monetary items are translated 
using the closing rate which is the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the spot exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined and non-monetary items that are measured in terms 
of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction.Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were 
translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous consolidated financial statements are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they 
arise, except for exchange differences arising on net investments in a foreign operation and financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment.  
When gains or losses on a non-monetary item are recognized in other comprehensive income, any exchange component of those gains or losses are 
also recognized in other comprehensive income.  Conversely, when gains or losses on a non-monetary item are recognized in profit or loss, any exchange 
component of those gains or losses are also recognized in profit or loss.3.2.2 Foreign operationsThe financial performance and financial position of all foreign operations, whose functional currencies differ from the Group’s presentation currency, are 
translated into the Group’s presentation currency using the following procedures.Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented (including comparatives) are translated at the closing rate at the end of the 
reporting period, unless the functional currency of the foreign operation is in hyper-inflationary economy.  Income and expenses in the statement of 
comprehensive income presented are translated using the average exchange rates for the period. All resulting exchange differences are recognized in other 
comprehensive income.Any goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising from 
the acquisition of that foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation.  Thus, they are expressed in the functional currency of 
the foreign operation and are translated into the presentation currency at the closing rate.On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation, recognized in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the separate component of equity, is reclassified from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification adjustment) 
when the gains or losses on disposal are recognized.  On the partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the Group redistributes the 
proportionate share of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognized in other comprehensive income to the non-controlling interests 
in that foreign operation.  In any other partial disposal of a foreign operation, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss only the proportionate share of the 
cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognized in other comprehensive income.3.2.3 Net investment in a foreign operationIf the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, then  
foreign currency difference arising on the item which in substance is considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation, are recognized 
in the other comprehensive income and shall be reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the investment.0923.3 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments3.3.1 Initial recognitionThe Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.  A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets (a purchase or sale of a financial asset under a contract whose terms require 
delivery of the financial instruments within the time frame established generally by market regulation or practice) is recognized and derecognized using 
trade date accounting.
The Group classifies financial assets as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, 
or financial assets at amortized cost. The Group classifies financial liabilities as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, or other financial liabilities. 
The classification depends on the nature and holding purpose of the financial instrument at initial recognition in the consolidated financial statements.At initial recognition, a financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at 
fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.
The fair value is defined as the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s 
length transaction.  The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (that is, the fair value of the consideration 
given or received) in an arm’s length transaction.3.3.2 Subsequent measurementAfter initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at amortized cost or fair value based on classification at initial recognition.Amortized costThe amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition:- minus the principal repayments
-  plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount 
- or any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance account) due to impairment or uncollectibilityFair valueFair values, which the Group primarily uses for the measurement of financial instruments, are the published price quotations based on market prices or 
dealer price quotations of financial instruments traded in an active market where available.  These are the best evidence of fair value.  A financial instrument 
is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, an entity in the same industry, 
pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis.If the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is determined either by using a valuation technique or independent third-party valuation 
service.  Valuation techniques include using recent arm’s length market transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, if available, referencing to the 
current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.The Group uses valuation models that are commonly used by market participants and customized for the Group to determine fair values of common over-
the-counter (OTC) derivatives such as options, interest rate swaps and currency swaps which are based on the inputs observable in markets.  For more 
complex instruments, the Group uses internally developed models, which are usually based on valuation methods and techniques generally used within the 
industry, or a value measured by an independent external valuation institution as the fair values if all or some of the inputs to the valuation models are not 
market observable and therefore it is necessary to estimate fair value based on certain assumptions.In addition, the fair value information recognized in the statement of financial position is classified into the following fair value hierarchy, reflecting the 
significance of the input variables used in the fair value measurement.Level 1 : quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date
 Level 2 : inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 
 Level 3 : unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety shall be determined on the basis of the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value 
measurement in its entirety.If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 
measurement.093If the valuation technique does not reflect all factors which market participants would consider in setting a price, the fair value is adjusted to reflect those 
factors.  Those factors include counterparty credit risk, bid-ask spread, liquidity risk and others.The chosen valuation technique makes maximum use of market inputs and relies as little as possible on entity-specific inputs.  It incorporates all factors that 
market participants would consider in setting a price and is consistent with economic methodologies applied for pricing financial instruments.  Periodically, 
the Group calibrates the valuation technique and tests its validity using prices of observable current market transactions of the same instrument or based 
on other relevant observable market data.3.3.3 DerecognitionDerecognition is the removal of a previously recognized financial asset or financial liability from the statement of financial position.  The Group derecognizes 
a financial asset or a financial liability when, and only when:Derecognition of financial assetsFinancial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or the financial assets have been 
transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are also transferred, or all the risks and rewards of ownership of 
the financial assets are neither substantially transferred nor retained and the Group has not retained control.  If the Group neither transfers nor disposes 
of substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets, the Group continues to recognize the financial asset to the extent of its 
continuing involvement in the financial asset.If the Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset in its entirety and recognize a financial liability for the consideration received.The Group writes off financial assets in its entirety or to a portion thereof when the principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are 
determined to be no longer recoverable. In general, the Group considers write-off if significant financial difficulties of the debtor, or delinquency in 
interest or principal payments is indicated.  The write-off decision is made in accordance with internal regulations and may require approval from external 
institution, if necessary.  After the write-off, the Group can collect the written-off loans continuously according to the internal policy.  Recovered amounts 
of financial assets previously written-off are recognized at profit or loss.Derecognition of financial liabilitiesFinancial liabilities are derecognized from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or 
expires.3.3.4 OffsettingFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated statement of financial position where there is a legally enforceable 
right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the assets and settle the liability simultaneously. The 
legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, 
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparty.3.4 Cash and Due from Financial InstitutionsCash and due from financial institutions include cash on hand, foreign currency, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and due from financial institutions.  Cash and due from financial 
institutions are measured at amortized cost.3.5 Non-derivative Financial Assets3.5.1 Financial assets at fair value through profit or lossFinancial assets classified as held for trading, financial assets designated by the Group as at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition, and financial 
assets that are required to be mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.The Group may designate certain financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss when the designation eliminates or 
significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as ‘an accounting mismatch’) that would otherwise arise from 
measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on different bases.After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is measured at fair value and gains or losses arising from a change in the fair 
value are recognized in profit or loss.  Interest income and dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are also recognized in 
the statement of comprehensive income.0943.5.2 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive incomeThe Group classifies below financial assets as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income;-  debt instruments that are a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, andconsistent with representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding or;-  equity instruments, not held for trading with the objective of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealer’s margin, designated asfinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive incomeAfter initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income is measured at fair value. Gain and loss from changes in fair 
value, other than dividend income and interest income amortized using effective interest method and exchange differences arising on monetary items 
which are recognized directly in income as interest income or expense, are recognized as other comprehensive income in equity.At disposal of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, cumulative gain or loss is recognized as profit or loss for the reporting 
period. However, cumulative gain or loss of equity instrument designated as fair value through other comprehensive income are not recycled to profit or 
loss at disposal.Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate. Exchange 
differences resulting from changes in amortized cost are recognized in profit or loss, and other changes are recognized as equity.3.5.3 Financial assets measured at amortized costA financial asset, which are held within the business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and consistent with 
representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are classified as a financial asset at amortized cost. 
Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method after initial recognition and interest 
income is recognized using the effective interest method.3.6 Expected Credit Loss of Financial Assets (Debt Instruments)The Group measures expected credit loss and recognizes loss allowance at the end of the reporting period for financial assets measured at amortized cost 
and fair value through other comprehensive income with the exception of financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss.Expected credit losses are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses (i.e. the present value of all cash shortfalls) over the expected life of the financial 
instrument. The Group measures expected credit losses by reflecting reasonable and supportable information that is reasonably available at the reporting 
date without undue cost or effort, including information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.The Group uses the following three measurement techniques in accordance with Korean IFRS:- General approach: for financial assets and off-balance-sheet unused credit line that are not applied below two approaches
- Simplified approach: for receivables, contract assets and lease receivables 
- Credit-impaired approach: for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assetsDifferent measurement approaches are applied depending on significant increase in credit risk. 12 month expected credit losses is recognized when credit 
risk has not significantly increased since initial recognition. A loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses is recognized when 
credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition. Lifetime is presumed to be a period to the contractual maturity date of a financial asset (the 
expected life of the financial asset).One or more of the following items is deemed significant increase in credit risk. 30 days past due presumption is applicable for all consolidated subsidiaries, 
and other standards are selectively applied considering applicability of each subsidiary with its specific indicators. When the contractual cash flows of a 
financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified, the Group determines whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition 
using the following information.- more than 30 days past due;
- decline in credit rating at period end by more than certain notches as compared to that at initial recognition;
- decline in ratings below certain level in the early warning system;
- debt restructuring (except for impaired financial assets); and
- credit delinquency information on Korea Federation of Banks, and etc.Under simplified approach, the Group shall always measure the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Under credit-
impaired approach, the Group shall only recognize the cumulative changes in lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition as a loss allowance 
for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets. In assessing credit impairment, the Group uses definition of default as in the new Basel Accord 
which rules calculation of Capital Adequacy Ratio.095The Group generally deems one or more of the following items credit-impaired:- no less than 90 days past due;
- legal proceedings related to collection;
- a borrower that has received a warning from the Korea Federation of Banks;
- corporate borrowers that are rated C or D;
- refinancing; and
- debt restructuring.3.6.1 Forward-looking informationThe Group uses forward-looking information, when it determines whether the credit risk has increased significantly and measures the expected credit losses.The Group assumes the risk components have a certain correlation with the economic cycle, and uses statistical methodologies to estimate the relation 
between key macroeconomic variables and risk components for the expected credit losses.The correlation between the major macroeconomic variables and the credit risk is as follows:Key macroeconomic variablesCorrelation between the majormacroeconomic variables and the credit riskDomestic GDP growth rate
Composite stock index
Construction investment change rate
Rate of change in housing transaction price index
Interest rate spread
Private consumption growth rate
Change of call rate compared to the last year (%p)
Household loan change rate(-)
(-)
(-)

(+)
(-)Forward-looking information used in calculation of expected credit losses is based on the macroeconomic forecasts utilized by management of 
the Group for its business plan taking into account reliable external agency’s forecasts and others. The forward-looking information is generated 
by KB Research under the Parent Company with comprehensive approach to capture the possibility of various economic forecast scenarios that are 
derived from the internal and external viewpoints of the macroeconomic situation. The Group determines the macroeconomic variables to be used 
in forecasting future condition of the economy, taking into account the direction of the forecast scenario and the significant relationship between 
macroeconomic variables and time series data. And there are some changes compared to the macroeconomic variables used in the previous year.3.6.2 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at amortized costThe amount of the loss on financial assets at amortized cost is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The Group estimates expected future cash flows for financial assets that are individually significant (individual assessment of impairment).For financial assets that are not individually significant, the Group collectively estimates expected credit loss by grouping loans with homogeneous credit 
risk profile (collective assessment of impairment).Individual assessment of impairmentIndividual assessment of impairment losses are calculated using management’s best estimate on present value of expected future cash flows. 
The Group  uses all the available information including operating cash flow of the borrower and net realizable value of any collateral held.Collective assessment of impairmentCollective assessment of loss allowance involves historical loss experience along with incorporation of forward-looking information. Such process 
incorporates factors such as type of collateral, product and borrowers, credit rating, size of portfolio and recovery period and applies ‘probability of 
default’(PD) on a group of assets and ‘loss given default’(LGD) by type of recovery method. Also, the expected credit loss model involves certain assumption 
to determine input based on loss experience and forward-looking information.  These models and assumptions are periodically reviewed to reduce gap 
between loss estimate and actual loss experience.Lifetime expected credit loss as at the end of the reporting period is calculated by product of carrying amount net of expected repayment, PD for each 
period and LGD adjusted by change in carrying amount.963.6.3 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive incomeMeasuring method of expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is equal to the method of financial assets 
at amortized cost, except for loss allowances that are recognized as other comprehensive income. Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income for 
sale or repayment of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.3.7 Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Group enters into numerous derivative financial instrument contracts such as currency forwards, interest rate swaps, currency swaps and others 
for trading purposes or to manage its exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange, amongst others.  These derivative financial 
instruments are presented as derivative financial instruments within the consolidated financial statements irrespective of transaction purpose and 
subsequent measurement requirement.The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an 
unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge) and the risk of changes in cash flow (cash flow hedge).  The Group designates non-derivatives as hedging 
instruments to hedge the risk of foreign exchange of a net investment in a foreign operation (hedge of net investment).At the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the Group’s risk management objective and 
strategy for undertaking the hedge.  This documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of 
the risk being hedged and how the Group will assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair 
value or cash flows  attributable to the hedged risk.Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted 
for as described below.3.7.1 Derivative financial instruments held for tradingAll derivative financial instruments, except for derivatives that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, are measured at fair value.  Gains or losses 
arising from a change in fair value are recognized in profit or loss as part of net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.3.7.2 Fair value hedgesIf derivatives qualify for a fair value hedge, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable 
to the hedged risk are recognized in profit or loss as part of other operating income and expenses. If hedged items are equity instruments and designated 
to present the change in fair value of the hedging instrument in other comprehensive income, recognized hedge ineffectiveness are presented in other  
comprehensive income. Fair value hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or 
the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.  Once fair value hedge accounting is discontinued, the 
adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item is fully amortized to profit or loss by the maturity of the financial instrument using the effective interest 
method.3.7.3 Cash flow hedgesThe effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive 
income, limited to the cumulative change in fair value (present value) of the hedged item (the present value of the cumulative change in the future 
expected cash flows of the hedged item) from the inception of the hedge. The ineffective portion is recognized in gain or loss (other operating income 
or expense). The associated gains or losses that were previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified from equity to profit or loss 
as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast cash flows affects profit or loss. The associated gains or 
losses that were previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the 
same period or periods during which the hedged forecast cash flows affects profit or loss.  Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if the 
hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the 
designation.  When the cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, the cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument that have been recognized in 
other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss over the year in which the forecast transaction occurs.  If the forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses that had been recognized in other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.3.7.4 Hedge of net investmentIf derivatives and non-derivatives qualify for a net investment hedge, the effective portion of changes in fair value of hedging instrument is recognized 
in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognized in profit.  The gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective 
portion of the hedge that has been recognized in other comprehensive income will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss as a 
reclassification adjustment on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation in accordance with Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments.973.7.5 Embedded derivativesIf a hybrid contract contains a host that is not an asset, an embedded derivative is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative if, and 
only if the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract and a separate instrument 
with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative and the hybrid (combined) instrument is not measured at fair 
value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.  Gains or losses arising from a change in the fair value of an embedded derivative separated 
from the host contract are recognized in profit or loss as part of net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.3.7.6 Day one gain and lossIf the Group uses a valuation technique that incorporates data not obtained from observable markets for the fair value at initial recognition of the financial 
instrument, there may be a difference between the transaction price and the amount determined using that valuation technique.  In these circumstances, 
the difference is deferred and not recognized in profit or loss, and is amortized by using the straight-line method over the life of the financial instrument.  If 
the fair value of the financial instrument is subsequently determined using observable market inputs, the remaining deferred amount is recognized in profit 
or loss as part of net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss or other operating income and expenses.3.8 Property and Equipment3.8.1 Recognition and measurementAll property and equipment that qualify for recognition as an asset are measured at cost and subsequently carried at cost less any accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.The cost of property and equipment includes any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be 
capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the 
site on which it is located.Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when they prolong the useful life or enhance values of the assets but the costs of the day-to-day servicing of 
the assets such as repair and maintenance costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.  When part of an item of an asset has a useful life different from 
that of the entire asset, it is recognized as a separate asset.3.8.2 DepreciationLand is not depreciated, whereas other property and equipment are depreciated using the method that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s future 
economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group.  The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value.Each part of an item of property and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.The depreciation method and estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:Property and equipment
Buildings and structures 
Leasehold improvements 
Equipment and vehiclesDepreciation methodStraight-lineDeclining-balance/ Straight-line 
Declining-balance/ Straight-lineEstimated useful lives20~40 years 
4~5 years 
3~15 yearsThe residual value, the useful life and the depreciation method applied to an asset are reviewed at each financial year end.  If expectations differ from 
previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.9 Investment Properties3.9.1 Recognition and measurementProperties held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both are classified as investment properties.  Investment properties are measured initially at 
their cost and subsequently the cost model is used.3.9.2 DepreciationLand is not depreciated, whereas other investment properties are depreciated using the method that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s future 
economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group.  The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value.98The depreciation method and estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:Investment propertiesBuildingsDepreciation methodStraight-lineEstimated useful lives20~40 yearsThe residual value, the useful life and the depreciation method applied to an asset are reviewed at each financial year end.  If expectations differ from 
previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.10 Intangible AssetsIntangible assets are measured initially at cost and subsequently carried at their cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.Intangible assets, except for goodwill and membership rights, are amortized using the straight-line method or double declining balance method with no 
residual value over their estimated useful economic life since the asset is available for use.Intangible assetsIndustrial property rightsSoftwareVOBA

Straight-lineDeclining-balanceStraight-lineEstimated useful lives20~40 years 
3 ~ 5 years 
60 years 
1 ~ 13 yearsThe amortization period and the amortization method for intangible assets with a definite useful life are reviewed at each financial year end.  Where an 
intangible asset is not being amortized because its useful life is considered to be indefinite, the Group carries out a review in each accounting period to 
confirm whether or not events and circumstances still support the assumption of an indefinite useful life.  If they do not, the change from the indefinite to 
definite useful life is accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.10.1 Value of business acquired (VOBA)The Group recorded value of business acquired (VOBA) as intangible assets, which are the differences between the fair value of insurance liabilities and 
book value calculated based on the accounting policy of the acquired company.  VOBA is an estimated present value of future cash flow of long-term 
insurance contracts at the acquisition date.  VOBA is amortized over the above estimated useful life using declining balance method, and the depreciation 
is recognized as insurance expense.3.10.2 GoodwillRecognition and measurementGoodwill arisen from business combinations before January 1, 2010, is stated at its carrying amount which was recognized under the Group’s previous 
accounting policy, prior to the transition to Korean IFRS.Goodwill acquired from business combinations after January 1, 2010, is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, 
fair value of non-controlling interest and the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the net 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the business acquired, the difference 
is recognized in profit or loss.For each business combination, the Group decides whether the non-controlling interest in the acquiree is initially measured at fair value or at the non-
controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date.Acquisition-related costs incurred to effect a business combination are charged to expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services 
are received, except for the costs to issue debt or equity securities.Additional acquisitions of non-controlling interestAdditional acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as equity transactions. Therefore, no additional goodwill is recognized.Subsequent measurementGoodwill is not amortized and is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.  However, goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an 
investment in associates is not separately recognized and an impairment loss recognized is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, which forms part 
of the carrying amount of the investment in the associates.993.10.3 Subsequent expenditureSubsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it enhances values of the assets.  Internally generated intangible assets, such as goodwill and trade name, 
are not recognized as assets but expensed as incurred.3.11 Impairment of Non-financial AssetsThe Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset, except for (i) deferred income tax assets, 
(ii) assets arising from employee benefits and (iii) non-current assets (or group of assets to be sold) classified as held for sale, may be impaired.  If any such 
indication exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.  However, irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, the 
Group tests (i) goodwill acquired in a business combination, (ii) intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and (iii) intangible assets not yet available for 
use for impairment annually by comparing their carrying amount with their recoverable amount.The recoverable amount is estimated for the individual asset.  If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, the Group 
determines the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs (the asset’s cash-generating unit).  A cash-generating unit is 
the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.  
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.  Value in use is the present value of the future cash 
flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit that are discounted by a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.  That 
reduction is an impairment loss and recognized immediately in profit or loss.  For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill arising from in a business 
combination is allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.  The impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the 
basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.  The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there 
is any indication that an impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset, other than goodwill, may no longer exist or may have decreased, and an 
impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill shall be reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used 
to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized.  The increased carrying amount of an asset other than goodwill 
attributable to a reversal of an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) 
had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.3.12 Non-current Assets Held for SaleA non-current asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use.  For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must 
be highly probable.  A non-current asset (or disposal group) classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell which is measured in accordance with the applicable Korean IFRS, immediately before the initial classification of the asset (or disposal group) as 
held for sale.A non-current asset while it is classified as held for sale or while it is part of a disposal group classified as held for sale is not depreciated (or amortized).Impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell.  Gains are recognized 
for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of the cumulative impairment loss that has been recognized.3.13 Financial LiabilitiesThe Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities in accordance 
with the substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of financial liabilities.  
The Group recognizes financial liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the financial liability.3.13.1 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or lossFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading or designated as such upon initial recognition. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognized in profit or loss. Upon 
initial recognition, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.100In relation to securities lending or borrowing transactions, the Group records transaction using memo value when it borrows securities from Korea 
Securities Depository etc. The borrowed securities are treated as financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss when the Group sells them. Changes 
in fair value at the end of the reporting period and difference between carrying amount at redemption and purchased amount are recognized as profit and 
loss.In addition, for the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability, the Group 
presents this change in other comprehensive income, and does not recycle this to profit or loss, subsequently.  When this treatment creates or enlarges an 
accounting mismatch, the Group recognizes this change as profit or loss for the current period.3.13.2 Other financial liabilitiesNon-derivative financial liabilities other than financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are classified as other financial liabilities.  Other financial 
liabilities include Deposits, Debts, Debentures and others.  At the date of initial recognition, other financial liabilities are measured at fair value minus 
transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost, 
and its interest expense is recognized, using the effective interest method.In case an asset is sold under repurchase agreement, the Group continues to recognize the asset with the amount sold being accounted for as borrowing.  
The Group derecognizes a financial liability from the consolidated statement of financial position only when it is extinguished (i.e. when the obligation 
specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires).3.14 Insurance ContractsKB Life Insurance Co., Ltd., and KB Insurance Co., Ltd., the subsidiaries of the Group, issue insurance contracts.Insurance contracts are defined as “a contract under which one party (the insurer) accepts significant insurance risk from another party by agreeing to 
compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder”.A contract that qualifies as an insurance contract remains 
an insurance contract until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire.  Such a contract that does not contain significant insurance risk is classified 
as an investment contract and is within the scope of Korean IFRS 1109, Financial Instruments to the extent that it gives rise to a financial asset or financial 
liability, except if the investment contract contains a Discretionary Participation Features (DPF).  If the contract has a DPF, the contract is subject to Korean 
IFRS 1104, Insurance Contracts.  The Group recognizes assets (liabilities) and gains (losses) relating to insurance contracts as other assets (liabilities) in the 
statement of financial position, and as other operating income (expenses) in the statement of comprehensive income, respectively.3.14.1 Insurance premiumsThe Group recognizes collected premiums as revenue on the due date of collection of premiums from insurance contracts and the collected premium 
which is not earned at the end of the reporting period is recognized as unearned premium.3.14.2 Insurance liabilitiesThe Group recognizes a liability for future claims, refunds, policyholders’ dividends and related expenses as follows:Premium reservePremium reserve refers to an amount based on the net premium method for payment of future claims with respect to events covered by insurance policies 
which have not yet occurred as of the reporting period.  It is calculated as the greater of the amount using standard interest rate and standard loss ratio 
defined by Financial Supervisory Services and the amount using the actual underlying data that have been used in premium calculation.Reserve for outstanding claimsReserve for outstanding claims refers to the amount not yet paid, out of an amount to be paid or expected to be paid with respect to the insured events 
which have arisen as of the end of each fiscal year.Unearned premium reserveThe premiums that are due before the end of the reporting period but applicable to the next period are included.Policyholders’ dividends reservePolicyholders’ dividends reserve including an interest rate guarantee reserve, a mortality dividend reserve and an interest rate difference dividend reserve is 
recognized for the purpose of provisioning for policyholders’ dividends in the future in accordance with statutes or insurance terms and conditions.1013.14.3 Liability adequacy testThe Group assesses at each reporting period whether its insurance liabilities are adequate, using current estimates of all future contractual cash flows 
and related cash flow such as claims handling cost, as well as cash flows resulting from embedded options and guarantees under its insurance contracts in 
accordance with Korean IFRS 1104.  If the assessment shows that the carrying amount of its insurance liabilities is insufficient in light of the estimated future 
cash flows, additional reserve is recognized for the deficient amount. Future cash flows from long-term insurance are discounted at a future rate of return 
on operating assets, whereas future cash flows from general insurance are not discounted to present value.  For liability adequacy tests of premium and 
unearned premium reserves, the Group considers all cash flow factors such as future insurance premium, deferred acquisition costs, operating expenses 
and operating premiums.  In relation to the reserve for outstanding claims, the Group elects to use a model that best reflects the trend of paid claims 
among several statistical methods to perform the adequacy test.3.14.4 Deferred acquisition costsAcquisition cost is deferred in an amount actually spent for an insurance contract and equally amortized over the premium payment period or the period 
in which acquisition costs are charged for the relevant insurance contract.  Acquisition costs are amortized over the shorter of seven years or premium 
payment period; if there is any unamortized acquisition costs remaining as of the date of surrender or lapse, such remainder shall be amortized in the period 
in which the contract is surrendered or lapsed.3.15 ProvisionsProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  The 
risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching the best estimate of provisions, and 
where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of provisions are the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to 
settle the obligation.Provisions on confirmed and unconfirmed acceptances and guarantees, unfunded commitments of credit cards and unused credit lines of consumer and 
corporate loans are recognized using a valuation model that applies the credit conversion factor, probability of default, and loss given default.Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.  If it is no longer probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provisions are reversed.If the Group has an onerous contract, the present obligation under the contract is recognized and measured as provisions.An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected 
to be received under it.  The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the minimum net cost to exit from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of 
fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfill it.3.16 Financial Guarantee ContractsA financial guarantee contract requires the issuer (the Group) to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified 
debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.Financial guarantee contracts are initially recognized at fair value as other liabilities, and are amortized over the contractual term.  After initial recognition, 
financial guarantee contracts are measured at the higher of:- The amount determined in accordance with Korean IFRS 1109, Financial Instruments or
-  The initial amount recognized, less, when appropriate, cumulative amortization recognized in accordance with Korean IFRS 1115, Revenue from Contractswith Customers.3.17 Equity Instruments Issued by the GroupAn equity instrument is any contract or agreement that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.3.17.1 Ordinary sharesOrdinary shares are classified as equity.  Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or the exercise of stock option are deducted from 
the equity, net of any tax effects.3.17.2 Hybrid SecuritiesThe financial instruments can be classified as either financial liabilities or equity in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Group classifies hybrid 
securities as an equity if the Group has the unconditional right to avoid any contractual obligation to deliver financial assets such as cash in relation to 
the financial instruments. As a result, hybrid securities issued by subsidiaries are classified as non-controlling interests, dividends are recognized in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income as profit attributable to non-controlling interests.1023.17.3 Treasury sharesIf the Group acquires its own equity instruments, these are accounted for as treasury shares and are deducted directly from equity.  No gains or losses are 
recognized in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own equity instruments. If an entity within the Group acquires and retains treasury 
shares, the consideration paid or received is directly recognized in equity.3.17.4 Compound financial instrumentsA compound financial instrument is classified as a financial liability or an equity instrument depending on the substance of the contractual arrangement of 
such financial instrument. The liability component of the compound financial instrument is measured at fair value of the similar liability without conversion 
option at initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortized cost using effective interest rate method until it is extinguished by conversion or 
matured. Equity component is initially measured at fair value of compound financial instrument in entirety less fair value of liability component net of tax 
effect and it is not remeasured subsequently.3.18 Revenue RecognitionThe Group recognizes revenues in accordance with the following revenue recognition standard:- Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer.
- Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
- Step 3: Determine the transaction price.
- Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
- Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.3.18.1 Interest income and expenseInterest income of financial assets at amortized cost and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and expense are recognized in 
the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.  The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost 
of a financial asset or a financial liability (or groups of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over 
the relevant period.The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument 
or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.  When calculating the effective interest rate, 
the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider future credit losses.  The calculation 
includes all fees and points paid (main components of effective interest rates only) or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of 
the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.  In those rare cases when it is not possible to estimate reliably the cash 
flows or the expected life of a financial instrument (or group of financial instruments), the Group uses the contractual cash flows over the full contractual 
term of the financial instrument (or group of financial instruments).Interest on impaired financial assets is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the 
impairment loss.Interest earned arising from debt investments at fair value through profit or loss is also classified as interest income in the statement of comprehensive 
income.3.18.2 Fee and commission incomeThe Group recognizes financial service fees in accordance with the accounting standard of the financial instrument related to the fees earned.Fees that are an integral part of the effective interest of a financial instrumentSuch fees are generally treated as adjustments of effective interest.  Such fees may include compensation for activities such as evaluating the borrower’s 
financial condition, evaluating and recording guarantees, collateral and other security arrangements, negotiating the terms of the instrument, preparing 
and processing documents and closing the transaction and origination fees received on issuing financial liabilities measured at amortized cost.  However, 
fees relating to the creation or acquisition of a financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss are recognized as revenue immediately.Fees earned as services are providedSuch fees are recognized as revenue as the services are provided.  Fees which can be earned through the certain periods, including account servicing fees, 
investment management fees, and etc. are recognized when the related services are provided.103Fees that are earned on the execution of a significant actSuch fees are recognized as revenue when the significant act has been completed.Commission on the allotment of shares to a client is recognized as revenue when the shares have been allotted and placement fees for arranging a loan 
between a borrower and an investor is recognized as revenue when the loan has been arranged.A syndication fee received by the Group that arranges a loan and retains no part of the loan package for itself (or retains a part at the same effective 
interest rate for comparable risk as other participants) is compensation for the service of syndication.  Such a fee is recognized as revenue when the 
syndication has been completed.3.18.3 Net gains/losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or lossNet gains/losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss include profit or loss (changes in fair value, dividends, and gain/loss from foreign 
currency translation) from following financial instruments:- Gain or loss from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss 
- Gain or loss from derivatives for trading, including derivatives for hedging that does not meet the condition of hedge accounting3.18.4 Dividend incomeDividend income is recognized in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established.  Dividend income is recognized as relevant items on 
statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in accordance with the classification of equity instruments.3.19 Employee Compensation and Benefits3.19.1 Post-employment benefits: defined contribution plansThe contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due.3.19.2 Post-employment benefits: defined benefit plansAll post-employment benefits, other than defined contribution plans, are classified as defined benefit plans.  The amount recognized as a defined benefit 
liability is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the end of the reporting period.The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit method.  The rate used 
to discount post-employment benefit obligations is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate 
bonds.  The currency and term of the corporate bonds are consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment benefit obligations.  
Actuarial gains and losses including experience adjustments and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in other comprehensive 
income.When the total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation minus the fair value of plan assets results in an asset, it is recognized to the extent of 
the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation, which arises when the Group introduces a defined benefit plan or 
changes the benefits of an existing defined benefit plan.  Such past service cost is immediately recognized as an expense for the reporting period.3.19.3 Short-term employee benefitsShort-term employee benefits are employee benefits (other than termination benefits) that are due to be settled within 12 months after the end of the 
period in which the employees render the related service.  The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for 
that service is recognized as a liability (accrued expense), after deducting any amount already paid.The expected cost of profit-sharing and bonus payments are recognized as liabilities when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to make 
such payments as a result of past events rendered by employees and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.3.19.4 Share-based paymentThe Group has provided its directors and employees with stock grant, and mileage stock programs. When stock grant options are exercised, the Group can 
either select to distribute newly issued shares or treasury shares or compensate in cash based on the share price. When mileage stock options are exercised,  
the Group pays the amount equivalent to KB Financial Group’s share price in cash.For a share-based payment transaction in which the terms of the arrangement provide the Group with the choice of whether to settle in cash or by issuing 
equity instruments, the Group determines that it has a present obligation to settle in cash because the Group has a past practice and a stated policy of 
settling in cash. Therefore, the Group accounts for the transaction in accordance with the requirements of cash-settled share-based payment transactions.104For mileage stock option, the Group accounts for the transaction in accordance with cash-settled share-based payment transactions, which are recognized 
as accrued expenses at the time of vesting.The Group measures the services acquired and the liability incurred at fair value, and the fair value is recognized as expense and accrued expenses over 
the vesting period. Until the liability is settled, the Group remeasures the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting period and at the date of 
settlement, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the reporting period.3.19.5 Termination benefitsTermination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts 
voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.  The Group shall recognize a liability and expense for termination benefits at the earlier of the 
following dates: when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group recognizes costs for a restructuring that is 
within the scope of Korean IFRS 1037 and involves the payment of termination benefits.  Termination benefits are measured by considering the number of 
employees expected to accept the offer in the case of a voluntary early retirement.  Termination benefits over 12 months after the reporting period are 
discounted to present value.3.20 Income Tax ExpensesIncome tax expense comprises current tax expense and deferred income tax expense.  Current and deferred income tax are recognized as income or 
expense for the period, except to the extent that the ax arises from (a) a transaction or an event which is recognized, in the same or a different period 
outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and (b) a business combination.3.20.1 Current income taxCurrent income tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit (loss) for a period.  A difference between the taxable profit and 
accounting profit may arise when income or expense is included in accounting profit in one period, but is included in taxable profit in a different period.  
Differences may also arise if there is revenue that is exempt from taxation, or expense that is not deductible in determining taxable profit (loss).  Current 
income tax liabilities (assets) for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be paid to (recovered from) the taxation authorities, 
using the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.The Group offsets current income tax assets and current income tax liabilities if, and only if, the Group (a) has a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognized amounts and (b) intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.3.20.2 Deferred income taxDeferred income tax is recognized, using the asset-liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax based amount of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amount in the financial statements.  Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary difference can be utilized.  However, deferred income tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition 
of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except for deferred income 
tax liabilities for which the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.The carrying amount of a deferred income tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period.  The Group reduces the carrying amount of a deferred 
income tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred 
income tax asset to be utilized.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability 
is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.  The measurement of 
deferred income tax liabilities and deferred income tax assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group 
expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.The Group offsets deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset 
current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities; and the deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity; or different taxable entities which intend 
either  to  settle  current  income  tax  liabilities  and  assets  on  a  net  basis,  or  to  realize  the  assets  and  settle  the  liabilities  simultaneously, 
in  each  future  period  in  which  significant  amounts  of  deferred  income  tax  liabilities  or  assets  are  expected  to  be  settled  or  recovered.1053.20.3 Uncertain tax positionsUncertain tax positions arise from tax treatments applied by the Group which may be challenged by the tax authorities due to the complexity of the 
transaction or different interpretation of the tax laws, a claim for rectification brought by the Group, or an appeal for a refund claimed from the tax 
authorities related to additional assessments.  The Group recognizes its uncertain tax positions in the consolidated financial statements based on the 
guidance in Korean IFRS 1012.  The income tax asset is recognized if a tax refund is probable for taxes paid and levied by the tax authority.  However, 
interest and penalties related to income tax are recognized in accordance with Korean IFRS 1037.3.21 Earnings per ShareThe Group calculates basic earnings per share amounts and diluted earnings per share amounts for profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders 
of the Parent Company and presents them in the statement of comprehensive income.  Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit or loss 
attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.  For the 
purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the Group adjusts profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Parent Company and the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares including convertible bonds and share options.3.22 LeasesAs explained in Note 2.2 above, the Group has changed its accounting policy for leases. The impact of the new accounting policies is disclosed in Note 45.Lease income from operating leases where the Group is a lessor is recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs 
incurred in obtaining an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the underlying asset and recognized as expense over the lease term on the 
same basis as lease income. The respective leased assets are included in the statement of financial position based on their nature. The Group did not need 
to make any adjustments to the accounting for assets held as a lessor as a result of adopting the new leasing standard.At inception of a contract, the Group is required to assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Also, at the date of initial application, the Group 
has assessed whether the contract is, or contains, a lease in accordance with the standard. However, the Group did not reassess all contracts as the Group 
elected to apply the practical expedient not to apply the standard to contracts that were not previously identified as containing a lease. On the basis of the 
date of initial application, the Group assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease.A lessee is required to recognize a right-of-use asset (lease assets) representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing 
its obligation to make lease payments. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:- Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable
- Variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate
- Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees
- The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and
- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that optionThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is 
used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment 
with similar terms and conditions.Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:- The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
- Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received
- Any initial direct costs, and
- Restoration costsHowever, short-term lease (lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less) and lease of low-value assets (For example, 
underlying leased asset under $ 5,000) are permitted to elect exceptional conditions.The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term.Related to sale and leaseback, an entity (seller-lessee) is required to applying IFRS 1115 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ to determine whether 
the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale of that asset. However, the Group has not reassessed sale and leaseback transactions entered into before 
the date of initial application.Extension and termination options are included in a number of leases across the Group. These terms are used to maximize operational flexibility in terms 
of managing contracts. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor. But the 
Group is evaluating its application in accordance with the IFRIC’s decision about “lease term and useful life of leasehold Improvements”1063.23 Operating SegmentsOperating segments are components of the Group where separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the chief operating 
decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.Segment information includes items which are directly attributable and reasonably allocated to the segment.3.24 Overlay ApproachThe Group applies the overlay approach in accordance with Korean IFRS 1104, and financial asset is eligible for designation for the overlay approach if, and 
only if, the following criteria are met:
-  It is measured at fair value through profit or loss applying Korean IFRS 1109 but would not have been measured at fair value through profit or loss in itsentirety applying Korean IFRS 1039.- It is not held in respect of an activity that is unconnected with contracts within the scope of Korean IFRS 1104.The Group reclassifies between profit or loss and other comprehensive income, and the amount reclassified is equal to the difference between:  
- The amount reported in profit or loss for the designated financial assets applying Korean IFRS 1109.
- The amount that would have been reported in profit or loss for the designated financial assets if the insurer had applied Korean IFRS 1039.The Group is permitted to apply this approach either at initial recognition or it may subsequently designate financial assets that newly meet criterion of not 
being held in respect of activity unconnected with insurance contract, they having previously not met that criterion.The Group continues to apply the overlay approach to a designated financial asset until that financial asset is derecognized. However, the Group 
de-designates a financial asset when the financial asset no longer meets the criterion. In this case, the Group reclassifies from accumulated other 
comprehensive income to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment any balance relating to that financial asset.At the beginning of any annual period, the Group may stop applying the overlay approach to all designated financial assets, and shall not subsequently 
apply the overlay approach, if it stops using this approach because it is no longer an insurer.4. Financial Risk Management
4.1 Summary4.1.1 Overview of financial risk management policyThe financial risks that the Group is exposed to are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and others.The Group’s risk management system focuses on increasing transparency, developing the risk management environment, preventing transmission of risk to 
other related subsidiaries, and the preemptive response to risk due to rapid changes in the financial environment to support the Group’s long-term strategy 
and business decisions efficiently.  Credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk have been recognized as the Group’s key risks.  These risks are 
measured and managed in Economic Capital or VaR (Value at Risk) using a statistical method.4.1.2 Risk management organizationRisk Management CommitteeThe Risk Management Committee establishes risk management strategies in accordance with the directives of the Board of Directors and determines 
the Group’s target risk appetite. The Committee approves significant risk matters and reviews the level of risks that the Group is exposed to and the 
appropriateness of the Group’s risk management operations as an ultimate decision-making authority.Risk Management CouncilThe Risk Management Council is a consultative group which reviews and makes decisions on matters delegated by the Risk Management Committee, and  
discusses the detailed issues relating to the Group’s risk management.Risk Management DivisionThe Risk Management Division is responsible for monitoring and managing the Group’s economic capital limit and managing detailed policies, procedures 
and working processes relating to the Group’s risk management.1074.2 Credit Risk4.2.1 Overview of credit riskCredit risk is the risk of possible losses in an asset portfolio in the event of a counterparty’s default, breach of contract and deterioration in the credit 
quality of the counterparty.  For risk management reporting purposes, the individual borrower’s default risk, country risk, specific risks and other credit risk 
exposure components are considered as a whole.The Group uses definition of default as defined and applied in the calculation of Capital Adequacy Ratio (Basel III) in accordance with the new Basel Accord.4.2.2 Credit risk managementThe Group measures expected losses and economic capital on assets that are subject to credit risk management whether on- or off-balance sheet items 
and uses expected losses and economic capital as a management indicator.  The Group manages credit risk by allocating credit risk economic capital limits.In addition, the Group controls the credit concentration risk exposure by applying and managing total exposure limits to prevent an excessive risk 
concentration to each industry and borrower.The Group has organized a credit risk management team that focuses on credit risk management in accordance with the Group’s credit risk management 
policy. Especially, the loan analysis department of Kookmin Bank, one of the subsidiaries, is responsible for loan policy, loan limit, loan review, credit 
management, restructuring and subsequent event management, independently of operating department.  On the other hand, risk management group of 
Kookmin Bank is responsible for planning risk management policy, applying limits of credit lines, measuring the credit risk economic capital, adjusting credit 
limits, reviewing credit and verifying credit evaluation models.4.2.3 Maximum exposure to credit riskThe Group’s maximum exposures of financial instruments, excluding equity securities, to credit risk without consideration of collateral values as of 
December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:Financial assetsDue from financial institutions at amortized cost1

than financial asset at fair value through profit or loss and recognizes loss allowance. Expected credit losses are a probability-weighted estimate of possible 
credit losses within certain range by reflecting reasonable and supportable information that is reasonably available at the reporting date without undue 
cost or effort, including information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. The Group assesses the expected 
credit losses for loans categorized in financial assets at amortized cost, and presents it with the name of account ‘allowance for loan losses’ netting from 
the related carrying amounts. For the expected credit losses for loans categorized in financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, the 
Group presents it in other comprehensive income.Loans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are classified as follows:The financial

126,814,607Due from financial institutions, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and derivatives that are linked to gold price are mostly relevant to financial 
and insurance industry with high credit ratings.4.3 Liquidity Risk4.3.1 Overview of liquidity riskLiquidity risk is a risk that the Group becomes insolvent due to uncertain liquidity caused by unexpected cash outflows, or a risk of borrowing high interest 
debts or disposal of liquid and other assets at a substantial discount. The Group manages its liquidity risk through analysis of the contractual maturity of 
interest-bearing assets and liabilities, assets and liabilities related to the other financing, and off-balance sheet items related to cash flow of currency 
derivative instruments and others.Cash flows disclosed for the maturity analysis are undiscounted contractual principal and interest to be received (paid) and; thus, are not identical to the 
amount in the financial statements that are based on the present value of expected cash flows in some cases. The amount of interest to be received or paid 
on floating rate assets and liabilities is measured on the assumption that the current interest rate would be the same through the maturity.4.3.2. Liquidity risk management and indicatorThe liquidity risk is managed by risk management policy and liquidity risk management guidelines which are applied to the risk management policies and 
procedures that address all the possible risks that arise from the overall business of the Group.The Group computes and manages cumulative liquidity gap and liquidity rate subject to all transactions that affect cash flow in Korean won and foreign 
currencies and off-balance sheet transactions in relation to the liquidity. The Group regularly reports to the Risk Planning Council and Risk Management Committee.1174.3.3. Analysis of remaining contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilitiesCash flows disclosed below are undiscounted contractual principal and interest to be received (paid) and; thus, are not identical to the amount in the 
consolidated financial statements that are based on the present value of expected cash flows. The amount of interest to be received or paid on floating rate 
assets and liabilities is measured on the assumption that the current interest rate would be the same through the maturity.The remaining contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities, excluding derivatives held for cash flow hedging, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, 
are as follows:(In millions of Korean won)December 31, 2019On demandUp to 1 month1-3

market factors that affect the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments including securities and derivatives amongst others. The most 
significant risk associated with trading positions interest rate risks, currency risks and also, stock price risks.  In addition, the Group is exposed to interest 
rate risks associated with non-trading positions.  The Group classifies exposures to market risk into either trading or non-trading positions. The Group 
measures and manages market risk separately for each subsidiary.4.4.2 Risk managementThe Group sets internal capital limits for market risk and interest rate risk and monitors the risks to manage the risk of trading and non-trading positions. 
The Group maintains risk management systems and procedures including trading policies and procedures, and market risk management guidelines for 
trading positions, and interest rate risk management guidelines for non-trading positions in order to manage market risk efficiently. The procedures 
mentioned are implemented with approval from the Risk Management Committee and Risk Management Council.Kookmin Bank, one of the subsidiaries, establishes market risk management policy, sets position limits, loss limits and VaR limits of each business group and 
approves newly developed instruments through its Risk Management Council. The Market Risk Management Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Risk 
Officer (CRO), is the decision maker and sets position limits, loss limits, VaR limits, sensitivity limits and scenario loss limits for each division, at the level of 
each individual business department.The ALCO of Kookmin Bank determines the operational standards of interest and commission, the details of the establishment and prosecution of the Asset 
Liability Management (ALM) policies and enacts and amends relevant guidelines. The Risk Management Committee and Risk Management Council monitor 
the establishment and enforcement of ALM risk management policies, and enact and amend ALM risk management guidelines. The interest rate risk limit 
is set based on the future assets/liabilities position and interest rate volatility estimation reflects the annual work plan. The ALM Department and Risk 
Management Department measures and monitors the interest risk status and limits on a regular basis. The status and limits of interest rate risks including 
interest gap, duration gap and interest rate VaR (Value at Risk), are reported to the ALCO and Risk Management Council on a monthly basis and to the 
Risk Management Committee on a quarterly basis. To ensure adequacy of interest rate and liquidity risk management, the Risk Management Department 
assigns the limits, monitors and reviews the risk management procedures and tasks conducted by the ALM Department. Also, the Risk Management 
Department independently reports related information to the management.1204.4.3 Trading PositionDefinition of a trading positionTrading positions subject to market risk management are defined under the Trading Policy and Guideline, and the basic requirements are as follows:– The trading position is not restricted for sale, is measured daily at fair value, and its significant inherent risks are able to be hedged in the market.
– The criteria for classification as a trading position are clearly defined in the Trading Policy and Guideline, and separately managed by the trading department.
– The trading position is operated in accordance with the documented trading strategy and managed through position limits.
– The operating department or professional dealers have an authority to enforce a deal on the trading position within predetermined limits without pre-approval.
– The trading position is reported periodically to management for the purpose of the Group’s risk managementObservation method on market risk arising from trading positionsSubsidiaries of the Group calculate VaR to measure the market risk by using market risk management systems on the entire trading portfolio. Generally, the 
Group manages market risk on the trading portfolio. In addition, the Group controls and manages the risk of derivative trading based on the regulations and 
guidelines formulated by the Financial Supervisory Service.VaR (Value at Risk)i. VaR (Value at Risk)Kookmin Bank, one of the subsidiaries, uses the value-at-risk methodology to measure the market risk of trading positions. Kookmin Bank uses the 10-day 
VaR, which estimates the maximum amount of loss that could occur in ten days under an historical simulation model which is considered to be a full 
valuation method. The distributions of portfolio’s value changes are estimated based on the data over the previous 250 business days, and ten-day VaR is 
calculated by subtracting net present market value from the value measured at a 99% confident level of portfolio’s value distribution results.VaR is a commonly used market risk measurement technique. However, the method has some shortcomings. VaR estimates possible losses 
over a certain period at a particular confidence level using past market movement data.  Past market movements are, however, not necessarily 
a good indicator of future events, as there may be conditions and circumstances in the future that the model does not anticipate. As a result, 
the timing and magnitude of the actual losses may vary depending on the assumptions made at the time of the calculation. In addition, the 
time periods used for the model, generally one or ten days, are assumed to be a sufficient holding period before liquidating the relevant 
underlying positions. If these holding periods are not sufficient, or too long, the VaR results may understate or overstate the potential loss.A subsidiary which holds trading positions uses an internal model (VaR) to measure general risk, and a standard method to measure each individual risk. 
When the internal model is not permitted for certain market risk, the Group uses the standard method. Therefore, the market risk VaR may not reflect 
the market risk of each individual risk and some specific positions. And also, non-banking subsidiaries use the same standard method applied to measure 
regulatory capital for improvement of market risk VaR management utility (improvement of relation with regulatory capital).ii. Back-TestingBack-testing is conducted on a daily basis to validate the adequacy of the market risk model. In back-testing, the Group compares both the actual and 
hypothetical profit and loss with the VaR calculations.iii. Stress TestingStress testing is carried out to analyze the impact of abnormal market situations on the trading and available-for-sale portfolio. It reflects changes in 
interest rates, stock prices, foreign exchange rates, implied volatilities of derivatives and other risk factors that have significant influence on the value of the 
portfolio. The Group uses historical scenarios and hypothetical scenarios for the analysis of abnormal market situations. Stress testing is performed at least 
once every year.VaR at a 99% confidence level of interest rate, stock price and foreign exchange rate risk for trading positions with a ten-day holding period by a subsidiary 
as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:Kookmin BankInterest rate risk

movements in the prices of debt securities arising from changes in interest rates. The Group manages interest rate risk on trading positions using market 
value-based tools such as VaR and sensitivity analysis (Price Value of a Basis Point: PVBP).ii. Stock price riskStock price risk only arises from trading securities denominated in Korean won as the Group does not have any trading exposure to shares denominated in 
foreign currencies. The trading securities portfolio in Korean won are composed of exchange-traded stocks and derivative instruments linked to stock with 
strict limits on diversification.iii. Foreign exchange rate riskForeign exchange rate risk arises from holding assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency and foreign currency derivatives.  Net foreign currency 
exposure mostly occurs from the foreign assets and liabilities which are denominated in US dollars and Chinese Yuan. The Group sets both loss limits and 
net foreign currency exposure limits and manages comprehensive net foreign exchange exposures which consider both trading and non-trading portfolios.4.4.4 Non-trading positionDefinition of non-trading positionManaged interest rate risk in non-trading position includes on- or off-balance sheet assets, liabilities and derivatives that are sensitive to interest rate, 
except trading position for market risk. The interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are interest-bearing assets and liabilities that create interest income 
and expenses.Observation method on market risk arising from non-trading positionAs a qualitative methodology, interest rate risk arises from a change in equity and earnings caused by fluctuation in value of interest rate sensitive assets 
and liabilities, and these risks are measured with change in Economic Value of Equity (△EVE) or interest rate VaR and change in Net Interest Income (△NII). 
In addition, as a quantitative methodology, average and longest maturity of interest rate revision for non-maturity deposits are monitored by the Group.Interest rate risk levelsi. Subsidiary Kookmin BankKookmin Bank calculates △EVE by applying six types of rate shock and crisis scenarios, and △NII by applying parallel rise and decline impact scenarios. The 
results as at December 31, 2019 are as follows:Scenario 1 (Parallel rise)
Scenario 2 (Parallel decline)
Scenario 3 (Short-term decline, long-term rise)
Scenario 4 (Short-term rise, long-term decline)
Scenario 5 (Short-term rise)

effect on capital.4.5.2 Risk managementThe purpose of operational risk management is not only to comply with supervisory and regulatory requirements but also to promote a risk management 
culture, strengthen internal controls, innovate processes and provide timely feedback to management and employees.  In addition, Kookmin Bank 
established Business Continuity Plans (BCP) to ensure critical business functions can be maintained, or restored, in the event of material disruptions arising 
from internal or external events. It has constructed replacement facilities as well as has carried out exercise drills for head office and IT departments to test 
its BCPs.4.6 Capital AdequacyThe Group complies with the capital adequacy standard established by the Financial Services Commission. The capital adequacy standard is based on Basel 
III published by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Bank of International Settlements in June 2011 and was implemented in Korea in December 
2013. The Group is required to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 8.0%(2018: 7.125%), a minimum Tier 1 ratio of :9.5%(2018: 8.625%) 
and a minimum Total Regulatory Capital of 11.5%(2018:10.625%) as of December 31, 2019.The Group’s equity capital is classified into three categories in accordance with the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory Regulations on 
Financial Holding Companies:126-  Common Equity Tier 1 Capital: Common equity Tier 1 Capital represents the issued capital that takes the first and proportionately greatest share of any 
losses and represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the Group, and not repaid outside of liquidation. It includes common shares issued, 
capital surplus, retained earnings, non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, accumulated other comprehensive income, other capital surplus 
and others.-  Additional Tier 1 Capital: Additional Tier 1 Capital includes (i) perpetual instruments issued by the Group that meet the criteria for inclusion in AdditionalTier 1 capital, and (ii) stock surplus resulting from the issue of instruments included in Additional Tier 1 capital and others.-  Tier 2 Capital: Tier 2 Capital represents the capital that takes the proportionate share of losses in the liquidation of the Group. Tier 2 Capital includes a 
fund raised by issuing subordinated debentures maturing in not less than five years that meet the criteria for inclusion in Additional Tier 2 capital, and 
the allowance for loan losses which are accumulated for assets classified as normal or precautionary as a result of classification of asset soundness in 
accordance with Regulation on Supervision of Financial Holding Companies and others.Risk weighted asset means the inherent risks in the total assets held by the Group.  The Group calculates risk weighted asset by each risk (credit risk, market 
risk, and operational risk) based on the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory Regulations on Financial Holding Companies and uses it for BIS 
ratio calculation.The Group assesses and monitors its adequacy of capital by using the internal assessment and management policy of the capital adequacy.  The 
assessment of the capital adequacy is conducted by comparing available capital (actual amount of available capital) and internal capital (amount of capital 
enough to cover all significant risks under target credit rate set by the Group).  The Group monitors the soundness of finance and provides risk adjusted 
basis for performance review using the assessment of the capital adequacy.Internal Capital is the amount of capital to prevent the inability of payment due to unexpected loss in the future.  The Group measures, allocates and 
monitors internal capital by risk type and subsidiaries.The Risk Management Council of the Group determines the Group’s risk appetite and allocates internal capital by risk type and subsidiary.  Each subsidiary 
efficiently operates its capital within a range of allocated internal capital.  The Risk Management Department of the Group monitors the limit on internal 
capital and reports the results to management and the Risk Management Council.  The Group maintains the adequacy of capital through proactive review 
and approval of the Risk Management Committee when the internal capital is expected to exceed the limits due to new business or business expansion.Details of the Group’s capital adequacy calculation in line with Basel III requirements as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:Equity Capital:
  Tier 1 Capital
     Common Equity Tier 1 Capital
     Additional Tier 1 Capital

402,284,954₩₩₩₩₩₩The fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an ordinary transaction between market 
participants.  For each class of financial assets and financial liabilities, the Group discloses the fair value of that class of assets and liabilities in a way that 
permits it to be compared with its carrying amount at the end of each reporting period. The best evidence of fair value of financial instruments is a quoted 
price in an active market.131Methods of determining fair value for financial instruments are as follows:Cash and due from financial  
institutionsInvestment securitiesLoans at amortized costDerivatives and Financial  
instruments at fair value  
through profit or lossDepositsDebtsDebenturesOther financial assets 
 
and liabilities6.1.2 Fair value hierarchyThe carrying amounts of cash and demand due from financial institutions and payment due from financial institutions 
are a reasonable approximation of fair values. These financial instruments do not have a fixed maturity and are 
receivable on demand. Fair value of ordinary due from financial institutions is measured using DCF model (Discounted 
Cash Flow Model).
The fair value of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets is determined using the quoted prices. 
Fair value is determined through the use of external professional valuation institution where quoted prices are not 
available.  The institutions use one or more of the following valuation techniques including DCF Model, Free Cash Flow 
to Equity Model, Comparable Company Analysis, Dividend Discount Model, Risk Adjusted Discount Rate Method, and 
Net Asset Value Method.
DCF model is used to determine the fair value of loans. Fair value is determined by discounting the expected cash 
flows, which are contractual cash flows adjusted by the expected prepayment rate, at appropriate discount rate.
For exchange traded derivatives, quoted price in an active market is used to determine fair value and for OTC 
derivatives, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. The Group uses internally developed valuation models 
that are widely used by market participants to determine fair values of plain vanilla OTC derivatives including options, 
interest rate swaps, and currency swaps, based on observable market parameters. However, some complex financial 
instruments are valued using appropriate models developed from generally accepted market valuation models 
including the Finite Difference Method, the Monte Carlo Simulation, Black-Scholes Model, Hull and White Model, 
Closed Form and Tree Model or valuation results from independent external professional valuation institution.
Carrying amount of demand deposits is regarded as representative of fair value because they do not have a fixed 
maturity and are payable on demand. Fair value of time deposits is determined using a DCF model. Fair value is 
determined by discounting the expected cash flows, which are contractual cash flows adjusted by the expected 
prepayment rate, at an appropriate discount rate.
Carrying amount of overdraft in foreign currency is regarded as representative of fair value because they do not have 
a fixed maturity and are payable on demand. Fair value of other debts is determined using a DCF model discounting 
contractual future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate.
Fair value is determined by using the valuations of external professional valuation institution, which are calculated 
using market inputs.
The carrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair values. These financial instruments are temporary accounts used 
for other various transactions and their maturities are relatively short or not defined.  However, fair value of finance lease 
liabilities is measured using a DCF model.The Group believes that valuation methods used for measuring the fair values of financial instruments are reasonable and that the fair values recognized in 
the statement of financial position are appropriate. However, the fair values of the financial instruments recognized in the statement of financial position 
may be different if other valuation methods or assumptions are used. Additionally, as there is a variety of valuation techniques and assumptions used in 
measuring fair value, it may be difficult to reasonably compare the fair value with that of other financial institutions.The Group classifies and discloses fair value of the financial instruments into the three-level hierarchy as follows:Level 1: The fair values are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date.Level 2: The fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.Level 3: The fair values are based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.When the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value 
measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. 
Assessing the significance of a particular input to the entire measurement requires judgment, taking into account factors specific to the asset or liability. If a fair 
value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement.Fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statements of financial positionThe fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statements of financial position as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, are

affected by the unobservable parameters, using a statistical technique. When the fair value is affected by more than two input parameters, the amounts 
represent the most favorable or most unfavorable Level 3 financial instruments subject to sensitivity analysis are (i) equity-related derivatives, currency-related 
derivatives and interest rate related derivatives whose fair value changes are recognized in profit or loss, (ii) financial liabilities designated at fair value through 
profit or loss, and (iii) due from financial institutions, debt securities, equity securities and loan receivables whose fair value changes are recognized in profit or 
loss or other comprehensive income. If overlay approach is applied in accordance with Korean IFRS 1104, changes in fair value of financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss are recognized as other comprehensive income.The results of the sensitivity analysis from changes in inputs are as follows:(In millions of Korean won)Financial assets

the underlying asset or correlation between underlying asset by ± 10%.
2  For Derivatives financial instruments, the changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters; such as, price of underlying asset, volatility 
of stock price, interest rate by ± 10% and the loss given default ratio, discount rate by ± 1%
3  For equity securities, the changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters; such as, correlation between growth rate (0~2.2%) and 
discount rate.
4  Sensitivity of fair values to unobservable parameters of private equity fund is practically impossible, but in the case of equity fund composed of real estates, the changes in 
fair value are calculated by shifting correlation between discount rate (-1~1%) and volatilities of real estate price (-1~1%).(In millions of Korean won)Financial assets

fair value are calculated by shifting correlation between discount rate (-1~1%) and volatilities of real estate price (-1~1%).6.2.4 Day one gain or lossIf the Group uses a valuation technique that incorporates data not obtained from observable markets for the fair value at initial recognition of financial 
instruments, there could be a difference between the transaction price and the amount determined using that valuation technique. In these circumstances, 
the fair value of financial instruments is recognized as the transaction price, and the difference is deferred and not recognized in profit or loss, and is amortized 
by using the straight-line method over the life of the financial instrument. When the fair value of the financial instruments is subsequently determined using 
observable market inputs, the remaining deferred amount is recognized in profit or loss.The aggregate difference yet to be recognized in profit or loss at the beginning and end of the year and a reconciliation of changes in the balance of this 
difference for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:Balance at the beginning of the year

1,457,4591  The Group has an obligation to early redeem the asset-backed debentures upon occurrence of an event specified in the agreement such as when the outstanding balance 
of the eligible asset-backed securitization (ABS), a trust-type ABS, is below the solvency margin ratio(minimum rate: 104.5%) of the beneficiary interest in the trust. To avoid 
such early redemption, the Group entrusts accounts and deposits in addition to the previously entrusted card accounts.The Group transferred held in the previous year the beneficiary certificates to Yuanta Securities at \ 74,853 million and entered into a total return swap 
contract. If the fair value of the transferred asset changes, the risk is attributed to the company in accordance with the contract.Securities under repurchase agreements and loaned securitiesThe Group continues to recognize the financial assets related to repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions on the statements of financial 
position since those transactions are not qualified for derecognition even though the Group transfers the financial assets. A financial asset is sold under 
a repurchase agreement to repurchase the same asset at a fixed price, or loaned under a securities lending agreement to be returned as the same asset. 
Thus, the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. The amounts of transferred assets and related liabilities as

derivative and spot exchange counterparties. Similar netting agreements are also entered into with the Group’s reverse repurchase, securities and others.  
Pursuant to these agreements, in the event of default by one party, contracts are to be terminated and receivables and payables are to be offset. Further, 
as the law allows for the right to offset, domestic uncollected receivables balances and domestic accrued liabilities balances are shown in its net settlement 
balance in the consolidated statement of financial position.147Details of financial assets subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreement as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as

The Group’s derivative operations focus on addressing the needs of the Group’s corporate clients to hedge their risk exposure and to hedge the Group’s 
risk exposure that results from such client contracts. The Group also engages in derivative trading activities to hedge the interest rate and foreign currency 
risk exposures that arise from the Group’s own assets and liabilities. In addition, the Group engages in proprietary trading of derivatives within the Group’s 
regulated open position limits.The Group provides and trades a range of derivatives products, including:- Interest rate swaps, relating to interest rate risks in Korean won
- Cross-currency swaps, forwards and options relating to foreign exchange rate risks,
- Stock price index options linked with the KOSPI index.In particular, the Group applies fair value hedge accounting using cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps and others to hedge the risk of changes in 
fair values due to the changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates of structured debts in Korean won, financial debentures in foreign currencies, 
structured deposits in Korean won, and structured deposits in foreign currencies. In addition, the Group applies net investment hedge accounting by 
designating financial debentures in foreign currencies as hedging instruments to hedge foreign exchange risks on net investments in foreign operations.Details of derivative financial instruments held for trading as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:Notional amount2019

2 Changed corporate name from MARITIME SECURITIES INCORPORATION.Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units, based on management’s analysis, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 
for impairment testing, and cash-generating units consist of an operating segment or units which are not larger than an operating segment. The Group 
recognized the amount of \ 65,288 million related to goodwill acquired in the merger of Housing & Commercial Bank. Of those respective amounts, the 
amounts of \ 49,315 million and \ 15,973 million were allocated to the Retail Banking and Corporate Banking, respectively. Cash-generating units to 
which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the unit may be impaired, by comparing the 
carrying amount of the unit, including the goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the unit.The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is measured at the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The fair value less costs to 
sell is the amount obtainable from the sale in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of disposal. If it is difficult 
to measure the amount obtainable from the sale, the Group measures the fair value less costs to sell by reflecting the characteristics of the measured 
cash-generating unit. If it is not possible to obtain reliable information to measure the fair value less costs to sell, the Group uses the asset’s value in use 
as its recoverable amount. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit. The 
projections of the future cash flows are based on the most recent financial budget approved by management and generally cover a period of five years.  
The future cash flows after projection period are estimated on the assumption that the future cash flows will increase by 1.0% for all other cash-generating 
units. The key assumptions used for the estimation of the future cash flows are the market size and the Group’s market share. The discount rate is a pre-
tax rate that reflects assumptions regarding risk-free interest rate, market risk premium and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow 
estimates have not been adjusted.179Details of intangible assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:Industrial property rights

Defined benefit planThe Group operates defined benefit plans which have the following characteristics:- The Group has the obligation to pay the agreed benefits to all its current and former employees.
- Actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more than expected) and investment risk fall, in substance, on the Group.The defined benefit liability recognized in the statements of financial position is calculated by independent actuaries in accordance with actuarial valuation 
methods.The net defined benefit obligation is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit method (the ‘PUC’). Data used in the PUC such as interest rates, future salary 
increase rate, mortality rate and consumer price index are based on observable market data and historical data which are updated annually.Actuarial assumptions may differ from actual results, due to changes in the market, economic trends and mortality trends which may impact defined benefit 
liabilities and future payments. Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in the period incurred through other 
comprehensive income.Changes in the net defined benefit liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:Present value of definedbenefit obligation2019Fair value of

changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in principal actuarial assumptions is calculated 
using the projected unit credit method, the same method applied when calculating the defined benefit obligations recognized on the statement of financial position.193Expected maturity analysis of undiscounted pension benefits (including expected future benefit) as of December 31, 2019 are as follows:Pension benefits1₩74,718₩153,129₩647,074₩1,365,073Up to 1 year1~2 years2~5 years5~10 years1 Excluded amount to be settled per promotion-incentivized defined contribution planThe weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 1.0 ~ 11.7 years.Expected contribution to plan assets for periods after December 31, 2019 is estimated to be \ 215,290 million.25.

of claims, and is classified as the insurance price risk and the reserves risk. The insurance price risk is the risk of loss that might occur when the actual risk 
exceeds the expected risk rate or expected insurance operating expenses ratios in calculation of premiums. It is the risk of loss that arises from differences 
between actual payment of claims and premiums received from policyholders. The reserves risk is the risk that arises due to a deficit in reserves at the date 
of assessment, making the Group unable to cover the actual claims payment in the future.37.5.2 Purposes, policies and procedures to manage risk arising from insurance contractsThe risks associated with insurance contract that the Group faces are the insurance actuarial risk and the acceptance risk.  Each risk occurs due to insurance 
contract’s pricing and conditions of acceptance. In order to minimize acceptance risk, the Group establishes guidelines and procedure for acceptance and 
outlines specific conditions for acceptance by product. In addition, expected risk level at the date of pricing is compared with actual risk of contracts after 
acceptance and various subsequent measures such as the adjustments in the interest rate and sales conditions, termination of selling specific product and 
others are taken in order to reduce insurance actuarial risk. The Group has a committee to discuss status of product acceptance risk and interest rate policy. 
The committee decides important matters to set the processes that allow minimizing the insurance actuarial risk, the acceptance risk and other business 
related risk.In addition, according to reinsurance operating standards, the Group establishes an operating strategy of reinsurance for large claims expense due to 
unexpected catastrophic events. The Group aims at policy holders’ safety and its stable profit achievement. For the long-term goal, the Group manages 
risk at a comprehensive level to keep its value at the maximum.37.5.3 Exposure to insurance price riskAccording to RBC standard, exposure to insurance price risk is defined as net written premiums for prior one year that is calculated by adding and 
subtracting original insurance premium, assumed reinsurance premium and ceded reinsurance premium.The Group’s exposure to insurance price risk as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, as follows:General

insurances (for private use, for hire, for business, bicycle and other), long-term insurances (long-term non-life, property damage, injury, driver, savings, 
illness, nursing and pension) and various other insurances. The Group’s risk is distributed through reinsurance, joint acceptance and diversified selling. In 
addition, insurances that cover severe level of risk, although there is rare possibility of the occurrence of disaster, such as storm and flood insurance are

changes in interest rates and it is managed to minimize unexpected loss. For long-term, non-life insurance contracts, the Group calculates exposure of 
interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Liabilities exposure is premium reserves less costs of termination deductions plus unearned premium 
reserve. Asset exposure is interest-bearing assets. Assets that receive only fees without interest are excluded from interest bearing assets. Exposures to 
interest rate risk as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:i) Exposure to interest rate riskLiabilitiesFixed interest rate

Duration is used to measure interest rate risk within risk based solvency test. ALM system is utilized to manage interest rate risk internally. In addition, Risk 
Management Committee sets ALM strategy every year to manage interest rate risk.iii) Sensitivity to changes in interest rates
Generally, when interest rates rise, the value and duration of assets and liabilities fall when interest rates fall, value and duration of assets and liabilities 
increase. Where duration of assets is shorter than that of liabilities with the interest rates fall, the interest risk is increased since the incremental portion of 
liabilities exceeds that of assets.iv) Negative spread risk control
In order to manage the reverse margins risk between interest expenses from liabilities and investment incomes on assets, the Group set the disclosure rate 
every month considering the market interest rate and the managing portfolio’s profit ratio.37.6 Risk management of life insurance37.6.1 OverviewInsurance risk is the risk of loss arising from the actual risk at the time of claims exceeding the estimated risk at the time of underwriting. Insurance risk is 
classified by insurance price risk and policy reserve risk.Insurance price risk is the risk of loss arising from differences between received from policyholders and actual claims paid.Policy reserve risk is the risk of loss arising from differences between policy reserves the Group holds and actual claims to be paid.The Group measures only insurance price risk under RBC requirement because life insurance claim payout is mainly in a fixed amount with less volatility in 
policy reserve and shorter waiting period before payment.22037.6.2 Concentration of insurance risk and reinsurance policyThe Group uses reinsurance to mitigate concentration of insurance risk seeking an enhanced capital management.The Group categorized reinsurance into group and individual contracts, and reinsurance is ceded through the following process:The Group’s reinsurance is ceded through the following process:i.  In the decision-making process of launching a new product, the Group makes a decision on ceding reinsurance. Subsequently, a reinsurer is selectedthrough bidding, agreements with the relevant departments and final approval by the executive management.ii. The reinsurance department analyzes the object of reinsurance, the maximum limit of reinsurance and the loss ratio with the relevant departments.37.6.3 The characteristic and exposure of insurance price riskThe exposure of insurance price risk is measured by the risk premium for all insurance contracts held for one year prior to the calculation date. The premium 
for risk retention is calculated by adding direct insurance premium and reinsurance assumed premium, and deducting reinsurance ceded premium (which is 
paid to reinsurance companies). If the holding risk premium is less than zero, the exposure of the insurance price is measured as zero.The insurance risk of a life insurance company is measured by insurance price risk. As the life insurance coverage is in the form of a fixed payment, the 
fluctuation of policy reserve is small and the period from insured event to claims payment is not long. The policy reserve risk is managed by assessments of 
adequacy of the policy reserve.The insurance price risk is managed through insurance risk management regulation established by Risk Management Committee.The maximum exposures to insurance price risk as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:Death

certificate of credit guarantee amounting to \ 400,000 million as collateral to a financial syndicate consisting of the Group and five other institutions.45. Changes in Accounting Policies - Implementation of Korean IFRS 1116 Leases
The Group applied Korean IFRS 1116 retrospectively as of January 1, 2019. However, the financial statements for the year ended 2018 was not restated 
using the method allowed by transitional provisions. Therefore reclassification and adjustments under the new IFRS were recognized in the financial 
statements beginning on January 1, 2019.A lessee shall apply this standard to its leases either:- retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented applying Korean IFRS 1008 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors (Full 
retrospective application); or
- retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application.The Group applied Korean IFRS 1116 retrospectively with recognizing the cumulative effect of initial adoption of the standard as at January 1, 2019. The 
Group did not restate any comparative financial statements.For leases previously classified as ‘finance leases’, the Group recognized the carrying amount of the lease asset and lease liability immediately before 
transition as the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of initial application. The measurement principles of Korean 
IFRS 1116 are only applied after that date. The remeasurements to the lease liabilities were recognized as adjustments to the related right-of-use assets 
immediately after the date of initial application.Right-of-use assetOperating lease commitments disclosed at December 31, 20181

The issuance of the Group’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, was initially approved on February 6, 2020 
and re-approved due to revision on March 4, 2020 by the Board of Directors.256Independent Auditor’s Report(English Translation of a Report Originally Issued in Korean)To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of KB Financial Group Inc.Opinion
We have audited the accompanying separate financial statements of KB Financial Group Inc.(the Company), which comprise the separate statements of 
financial position as at December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the separate statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the years 
then ended, and notes to the separate financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.In our opinion, the accompanying separate financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the separate financial position of the Company as at 
December 31, 2019 and 2018, and its separate financial performance and cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the Republic of Korea (Korean IFRS).We also have audited, in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing, the Company’s Internal Control over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2019, 
based on Conceptual Framework for Designing and Operating Internal Control over Financial Reporting and our report dated March 5, 2020 expressed an 
unqualified opinion.Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audits in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical 
requirements of the Republic of Korea that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with the ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.Key Audit Matters
No key audit matter is identified to be described in this audit report.Other Matter
Auditing standards and their application in practice vary among countries. The procedures and practices used in the Republic of Korea to audit such 
financial statements may differ from those generally accepted and applied in other countries.Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the separate financial statements in accordance with Korean IFRS, and for such 
internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company 
or to cease operations.Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.257Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout 
the audit. We also:·   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.·   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances·   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.·    Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a 
material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.·    Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statementsrepresent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our 
report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Yeob Yu, Certified Public Accountant.Samil PricewaterhouseCoopersSeoul, Korea

KB Financial Group Inc. (the “Company”), in accordance with Financial Holding Companies Act, was established on September 29, 2008, through stock 
transfers with the former shareholders of Kookmin Bank, KB Investment & Securities Co., Ltd., KB Asset Management Co., Ltd., KB Real Estate Trust Co., Ltd., 
KB Investment Co., Ltd., KB Futures Co., Ltd., KB Credit Information Co., Ltd., and KB Data Systems Co., Ltd. in order to provide management services and 
financing to associated companies. The headquarters are located at 26, Gukjegeumyung-ro-8-gil, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul. The Company’s share capital 
as of December 31, 2019, is ₩ 2,090,558 million. In 2011, Kookmin Bank spun off its credit card business segment and established a new separate credit 
card company, KB Kookmin Card Co., Ltd., and KB Investment & Securities Co., Ltd. merged with KB Futures Co., Ltd. The Company established KB Savings 
Bank Co., Ltd. in January 2012, acquired Yehansoul Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in September 2013, and KB Savings Bank Co., Ltd. merged with Yehansoul Savings 
Bank Co., Ltd. in January 2014. In March 2014, the Company acquired Woori Financial Co., Ltd. and changed the name to KB Capital Co., Ltd. Meanwhile, 
the Company included LIG Insurance Co., Ltd. as an associate and changed the name to KB Insurance Co., Ltd. in June 2015. Also, the Company included 
Hyundai Securities Co., Ltd. as an associate in June 2016 and included as a subsidiary on October 2016 by comprehensive exchange of shares. Hyundai 
Securities Co., Ltd. merged with KB Investment & Securities Co., Ltd. in December 2016 and changed the name to KB Securities Co., Ltd. in January 2017. KB 
Insurance Co., Ltd. became one of the subsidiaries through a tender after in May 2017.The Company has been listed on the Korea Exchange (“KRX”) since October 10, 2008, and on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) for its American 
Depositary Shares (“ADS”) since September 29, 2008. Number of shares authorized on its Articles of Incorporation is 1,000 million.2. Basis of Preparation
2.1 Application of Korean IFRSThe Company maintains its accounting records in Korean won and prepares statutory financial statements in the Korean language (“Hangeul”) in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the Republic of Korea (“Korean IFRS”). The accompanying separate financial 
statements have been condensed, restructured and translated into English from the Korean language financial statements.Certain information attached to the Korean language financial statements, but not required for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, 
financial performance or cash flows, is not presented in the accompanying separate financial statements.The separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Korean IFRS. These are the standards, subsequent amendments 
and related interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) that have been adopted by the Republic of Korea.The preparation of separate financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. Management also needs to exercise judgment in 
applying the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are 
significant to the separate financial statements are disclosed in Note 2.4.The separate financial statements were prepared in accordance with Korean IFRS 1027, Separate Financial Statements.2.1.1 New and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the CompanyThe Company has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual reporting period commencing January 1, 2019.- Enactment of Korean IFRS 1116 LeasesKorean IFRS 1116 Leases replaces Korean IFRS 1017 Leases. Under Korean IFRS 1116, with implementation of a single lease model, lessee is required 
to recognize assets and liabilities for all lease which lease term is over 12 months and underlying assets are not low value assets. A lessee is required to 
recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.With implementation of Korean IFRS 1116 Lease, the Company has changed accounting policy. The Company has adopted Korean IFRS 1116 retrospectively, 
as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the standard, and recognized the cumulative impact of initially applying the standard as of January 
1, 2019, the date of initial application. The Company has not restated comparatives for the 2018 reporting period. The impact of the adoption of the leasing 
standard and the new accounting policies are disclosed in Note 31.263- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1109 Financial InstrumentsThe narrow-scope amendments made to Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments enable entities to measure certain prepayable financial assets with 
negative compensation at amortized cost. When a modification of a financial liability measured at amortized cost that does not result in the derecognition, 
a modification gain or loss shall be recognized in profit or loss. The amendment does not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1019 Employee BenefitsThe amendments require that an entity shall calculate current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the reporting period after a plan 
amendment, curtailment or settlement based on updated actuarial assumptions from the date of the change. The amendments also require that a 
reduction in a surplus must be recognized in profit or loss even if that surplus was not previously recognized because of the impact of the asset ceiling. The 
amendment does not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1028 Investments in Associates and Joint VenturesThe amendments clarify that an entity shall apply Korean IFRS 1109 to financial instruments in an associate or joint venture to which the equity method is 
not applied. These include long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the entity’s net investment in an associate or joint venture. The amendment 
does not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.- Enactment of Interpretation of Korean IFRS 2123 Uncertainty over Income Tax TreatmentsThe Interpretation explains how to recognize and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax 
treatment, and includes guidance on how to determine whether each uncertain tax treatment is considered separately or together. It also presents 
examples of circumstances where a judgement or estimate is required to be reassessed. The enactment does not have a significant impact on the 
Company’s financial statements.- Annual Improvements to Korean IFRS 1103 Business CombinationThe amendments clarify that when a party to a joint arrangement obtains control of a business that is a joint operation, and had rights to the assets and 
obligations for the liabilities relating to that joint operation immediately before the acquisition date, the transaction is a business combination achieved in 
stages. In such cases, the acquirer shall remeasure its entire previously held interest in the joint operation. The amendments have no significant effect on 
the Company’s financial statements.- Annual Improvements to Korean IFRS 1111 Joint AgreementsThe amendments clarify that when a party that participates in, but does not have joint control of, a joint operation might obtain joint control of the 
joint operation in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business. In such cases, previously held interests in the joint operation are not 
remeasured. The amendments have no significant effect on the Company’s financial statements.- Annual Improvements to Paragraph 57A of Korean IFRS 1012 Income TaxThe amendment is applied to all the income tax consequences of dividends and requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of dividends 
in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity according to where the entity originally recognized those past transactions or events. The 
amendments have no significant effect on the Company’s financial statements.- Annual Improvements to Korean IFRS 1023 Borrowing CostThe amendments clarify that if a specific borrowing remains outstanding after the related qualifying asset is ready for its intended use (or sale), it becomes 
part of general borrowings. The amendments have no significant effect on the Company’s financial statements.2.1.2 New and amended standards and interpretations not yet adopted by the CompanyCertain new accounting standards and interpretations that have been published but are not mandatory for the reporting period commencing January 1, 
2019 and have not been early adopted by the Company are set out below.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1001 Presentation of Financial Statements and Korean IFRS 1008 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and 
errors – Definition of MaterialThe amendments clarify the explanation of the definition of material and amended Korean IFRS 1001 and Korean IFRS 1008 in accordance with the clarified 
definitions. Materiality is assessed by reference to omission or misstatement of material information as well as effects of immaterial information, and to the 
nature of the users when determining the information to be disclosed by the Company. These amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning 
on or after January 1, 2020, and earlier application of permitted. The Company does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the 
financial statements.264- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1103 Business Combination – Definition of a BusinessTo consider the integration of the required activities and assets as a business, the amended definition of a business requires an acquisition to include an 
input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs and excludes economic benefits from the lower costs. 
An entity can apply a concentration test, an optional test, where substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset 
or a group of similar assets, the assets acquired would not represent a business. These amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2020, and earlier application of permitted. The Company does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on the financial 
statements.- IFRS Interpretation Committee’s agenda decisions - Lease TermOn December 16, 2019, the IFRS Interpretations Committee announced an interpretation of the “lease term and useful life of leasehold improvements”. 
This interpretation deals with how to determine the lease term of a cancellable lease or a renewable lease and whether the useful life of non-removable 
leasehold improvements is limited by the relevant lease term. According to this interpretation, the Company should identify factors to consider the broader 
economic penalty, reflect identified factors to accounting policies, and calculate lease term again based on accounting policy.However, due to the large number of lease contracts held by the Company and varying terms of the contract, the Company determined that sufficient 
time would be required to set up items to be included in the review of extensive economic penalty and to establish procedures for collecting and analyzing 
necessary information. Therefore, the effect of the changes in accounting policy for the lease term is not reflected in the separate financial statements for 
the current reporting period.If the accounting policy for the lease term is changed in the annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020, the amount of the related right-of-use 
assets and lease liabilities may increase, and the separate financial statements may need to be retroactively restated to reflect this effect.2.2 Measurement BasisThe separate financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified.2.3 Functional and Presentation CurrencyItems included in the separate financial statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Company operates (“the functional currency”). The separate financial statements are presented in Korean won, which is the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency.2.4 Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of separate financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that 
may have a significant impact on the assets (liabilities) and incomes (expenses). Management’s estimates of outcomes may differ from actual outcomes if 
management’s estimates and assumptions based on management’s best judgment at the reporting date are different from the actual environment.Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and any change in an accounting estimate is recognized prospectively by including it in profit or loss 
in the period of the change, if the change affects that period only. Alternatively, if the change in accounting estimate affects both the period of change and 
future periods, that change is recognized in the profit or loss of all those periods.Uncertainty in estimates and assumptions with significant risk that may result in material adjustment to the separate financial statements are as follows:2.4.1 Income taxesThe Company is operating in numerous countries and the income generated from these operations is subject to income taxes based on tax laws and 
interpretations of tax authorities in numerous jurisdictions. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain.If certain portion of the taxable income is not used for investments, increase in wages, and others in accordance with the Tax System for Promotion of 
Investment and Collaborative Cooperation (Recirculation of Corporate Income), the Company is liable to pay additional income tax calculated based on the 
tax laws.  The new tax system is effective for three years from 2018. Accordingly, the measurement of current and deferred income tax is affected by the tax 
effects from the new system.  As the Company’s income tax is dependent on the investments, increase in wages, and others, there exists uncertainty with 
regard to measuring the final tax effects.2652.4.2 Fair value of financial instrumentsThe fair value of financial instruments where no active market exists or where quoted prices are not otherwise available is determined by using valuation 
techniques. Financial instruments, which are not actively traded in the market and those with less transparent market prices, will have less objective fair 
values and require broad judgment on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty in market factors and assumptions in price determination and other risks.As described in the significant accounting policies in Note 3.1, ‘Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments’, diverse valuation techniques are 
used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, from generally accepted market valuation models to internally developed valuation models that 
incorporate various types of assumptions and variables.2.4.3 Net defined benefit liabilityThe present value of net defined benefit liability depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions (Note 16).3. Significant Accounting Policies
The significant accounting policies and calculation methods applied in the preparation of these separate financial statements have been consistently 
applied to all periods presented, except for the impact of changes due to enactment of new standards, amendments and interpretations disclosed in Note 2.1 
and the following paragraph.3.1 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments3.1.1 Initial recognitionThe Company recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.  A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets (a purchase or sale of a financial asset under a contract whose terms require 
delivery of the financial instruments within the time frame established generally by market regulation or practice) is recognized and derecognized using 
trade date accounting.The Company classifies financial assets as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, 
or financial assets at amortized cost.  The Company classifies financial liabilities as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, or other financial 
liabilities.  The classification depends on the nature and holding purpose of the financial instrument at initial recognition in the separate financial statements.At initial recognition, a financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at 
fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.The fair value is defined as the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s 
length transaction.  The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (that is, the fair value of the consideration 
given or received) in an arm’s length transaction.3.1.2 Subsequent measurementAfter initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at amortized cost or fair value based on classification at initial recognition.Amortized costThe amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition:- minus the principal repayments
- plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount
- or any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance account) due to impairment or uncollectibilityFair valueFair values, which the Company primarily uses for the measurement of financial instruments, are the published price quotations based on market prices or 
dealer price quotations of financial instruments traded in an active market where available.  These are the best evidence of fair value.  A financial instrument 
is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, an entity in the same industry, 
pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis.266If the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is determined either by using a valuation technique or independent third-party valuation 
service.  Valuation techniques include using recent arm’s length market transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, if available, referencing to the 
current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.The Company uses valuation models that are commonly used by market participants and customized for the Company to determine fair values of common 
over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives such as options, interest rate swaps and currency swaps which are based on the inputs observable in markets.  For more 
complex instruments, the Company uses internally developed models, which are usually based on valuation methods and techniques generally used within 
the industry, or a value measured by an independent external valuation institution as the fair values if all or some of the inputs to the valuation models are 
not market observable and therefore it is necessary to estimate fair value based on certain assumptions.In addition, the fair value information recognized in the statement of financial position is classified into the following fair value hierarchy, reflecting the 
significance of the input variables used in the fair value measurement.Level 1 : quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date
 Level 2 : inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 
 Level 3 : unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety shall be determined on the basis of the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value 
measurement in its entirety.If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 
measurement.If the valuation technique does not reflect all factors which market participants would consider in setting a price, the fair value is adjusted to reflect those 
factors.  Those factors include counterparty credit risk, bid-ask spread, liquidity risk and others.The chosen valuation technique makes maximum use of market inputs and relies as little as possible on entity-specific inputs.  It incorporates all factors 
that market participants would consider in setting a price and is consistent with economic methodologies applied for pricing financial instruments.  
Periodically, the Company calibrates the valuation technique and tests its validity using prices of observable current market transactions of the same 
instrument or based on other relevant observable market data.3.1.3 DerecognitionDerecognition is the removal of a previously recognized financial asset or financial liability from the statement of financial position.  The Company 
derecognizes a financial asset or a financial liability when, and only when:Derecognition of financial assetsFinancial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or the financial assets have been 
transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are also transferred, or all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the financial assets are neither substantially transferred nor retained and the Company has not retained control.  If the Company neither transfers nor 
disposes of substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets, the Company continues to recognize the financial asset to the extent 
of its continuing involvement in the financial asset.If the Company transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset, the Company continues to recognize the transferred asset in its entirety and recognize a financial liability for the 
consideration received.The Company writes off financial assets in its entirety or to a portion thereof when the principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are 
determined to be no longer recoverable. In general, the Company considers write-off if significant financial difficulties of the debtor, or delinquency in 
interest or principal payments is indicated.  The write-off decision is made in accordance with internal regulations and may require approval from external 
institution, if necessary.  After the write-off, the Company can collect the written-off loans continuously according to the internal policy.  Recovered 
amounts of financial assets previously written-off are recognized at profit or loss.Derecognition of financial liabilitiesFinancial liabilities are derecognized from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or 
expires.2673.1.4 OffsettingFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the separate statement of financial position where there is a legally enforceable 
right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the assets and settle the liability simultaneously.  The 
legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, 
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty.3.2 Cash and Due from Financial InstitutionsCash and due from financial institutions include cash on hand, foreign currency, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and due from financial institutions.  Cash and due from financial 
institutions are measured at amortized cost.3.3 Non-derivative Financial Assets3.3.1 Financial assets at fair value through profit or lossFinancial assets classified as held for trading, financial assets designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition, and 
financial assets that are required to be mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.The Company may designate certain financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss when the designation eliminates or 
significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as ‘an accounting mismatch’) that would otherwise arise from 
measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on different bases.After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is measured at fair value and gains or losses arising from a change in the fair 
value are recognized in profit or loss.  Interest income and dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are also recognized in 
the statement of comprehensive income.3.3.2 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive incomeThe Company classifies below financial assets as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income;-  debt instruments with a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and consistentwith representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding or;-  equity instruments, not held for trading with the objective of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealer’s margin, designated asfinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive incomeAfter initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income is measured at fair value. Gain and loss from changes in fair 
value, other than dividend income and interest income amortized using effective interest method and exchange differences arising on monetary items 
which are recognized directly in income as interest income or expense, are recognized as other comprehensive income in equity.At disposal of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, cumulative gain or loss is recognized as profit or loss for the reporting 
period. However, cumulative gain or loss of equity instrument designated as fair value through other comprehensive income are not recycled to profit or 
loss at disposal.Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate. Exchange 
differences resulting from changes in amortized cost are recognized in profit or loss, and other changes are recognized as equity.3.3.3 Financial assets measured at amortized costA financial asset, which are held within the business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and consistent with 
representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are classified as a financial asset at amortized cost.Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method after initial recognition and interest 
income is recognized using the effective interest method.3.4 Expected Credit Loss of Financial Assets (Debt Instruments)The Company measures expected credit loss and recognizes loss allowance at the end of the reporting period for financial assets measured at amortized 
cost and fair value through other comprehensive income with the exception of financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss.268Expected credit losses are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses (i.e. the present value of all cash shortfalls) over the expected life of the financial 
instrument.  The Company measures expected credit losses by reflecting reasonable and supportable information that is reasonably available at the 
reporting date without undue cost or effort, including information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.The Company uses the following three measurement techniques in accordance with Korean IFRS:- General approach: for financial assets and off-balance-sheet unused credit line that are not applied below two approaches
- Simplified approach: for receivables, contract assets and lease receivables 
- Credit-impaired approach: for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assetsDifferent measurement approaches are applied depending on significant increase in credit risk. 12 month expected credit losses is recognized when credit 
risk has not significantly increased since initial recognition. A loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses is recognized when 
credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition. Lifetime is presumed to be a period to the contractual maturity date of a financial asset (the 
expected life of the financial asset).One or more of the following items is deemed significant increase in credit risk.  When the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or 
otherwise modified, the Company determines whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition using the following information.- more than 30 days past due;
- decline in credit rating at period end by more than certain notches as compared to that at initial recognition;
- debt restructuring (except for impaired financial assets); and
- credit delinquency information on Korea Federation of Banks, and etc.Under simplified approach, the Company shall always measure the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Under credit-
impaired approach, the Company shall only recognize the cumulative changes in lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition as a loss allowance 
for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets. In assessing credit impairment, the Company uses definition of default as in the new Basel 
Accord which rules calculation of Capital Adequacy Ratio.The Company generally deems one or more of the following items credit-impaired:- no less than 90 days past due;
- legal proceedings related to collection;
- a borrower that has received a warning from the Korea Federation of banks;
- corporate borrowers that are rated C or D;
- debt restructuring.3.4.1 Forward-looking informationThe Company uses forward-looking information, when it determines whether the credit risk has increased significantly and measures the expected credit losses.The Company assumes the risk components have a certain correlation with the economic cycle, and uses statistical methodologies to estimate the relation 
between key macroeconomic variables and risk components for the expected credit losses. The correlation between the major macroeconomic variables 
and the credit risk is as follows;Key macroeconomic variablesCorrelation between the majormacroeconomic variables and the credit riskDomestic GDP growth rate
Composite stock index
Construction investment change rate
Rate of change in housing transaction price index
Interest rate spread
Private consumption growth rate(-)
(-)
(-)
(-)
(+)
(-)Forward-looking information used in calculation of expected credit losses is based on the macroeconomic forecasts utilized by management of the 
Company for its business plan taking into account reliable external agency’s forecasts and others. The forward-looking information is generated by KB 
Research under KB Financial Group with comprehensive approach to capture the possibility of various economic forecast scenarios that are derived from 
the internal and external viewpoints of the macroeconomic situation. The Company determines the macroeconomic variables to be used in forecasting 
future condition of the economy, taking into account the direction of the forecast scenario and the significant relationship between macroeconomic 
variables and time series data. And there are some changes compared to the macroeconomic variables used in the previous year.2693.4.2 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at amortized costThe amount of the loss on financial assets at amortized cost is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.The Company estimates expected future cash flows for financial assets that are individually significant (individual assessment of impairment).For financial assets that are not individually significant, the Company collectively estimates expected credit loss by grouping loans with homogeneous credit 
risk profile (collective assessment of impairment).Individual assessment of impairmentIndividual assessment of impairment losses are calculated using management’s best estimate on present value of expected future cashflows.  The Company 
uses all the available information including operating cash flow of the borrower and net realizable value of any collateral held.Collective assessment of impairmentCollective assessment of loss allowance involves historical loss experience along with incorporation of forward-looking information. Such process 
incorporates factors such as type of collateral, product and borrowers, credit rating, size of portfolio and recovery period and applies Probability of 
Default(PD) on a group of assets and Loss Given Default(LGD) by type of recovery method. Also, the expected credit loss model involves certain assumption 
to determine input based on loss experience and forward-looking information.  These models and assumptions are periodically reviewed to reduce gap 
between loss estimate and actual loss experience.Lifetime expected credit loss as at the end of the reporting period is calculated by product of carrying amount net of expected repayment, PD for each 
period and LGD adjusted by change in carrying amount.3.4.3 Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive incomeMeasuring method of expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is equal to the method of financial assets 
at amortized cost, except for loss allowances that are recognized as other comprehensive income. Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income for 
sale or repayment of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.3.5 Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the following revenue recognition standard:- Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer.
- Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
- Step 3: Determine the transaction price.
- Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
- Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.3.5.1 Interest income and expenseInterest income of financial assets at amortized cost and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and expense are recognized in 
statements of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.  The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of 
a financial asset or a financial liability (or groups of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the 
relevant period.The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument 
or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.  When calculating the effective interest rate, 
the Company estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider future credit losses.  The calculation 
includes all fees and points paid (main components of effective interest rates only) or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of 
the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.  In those rare cases when it is not possible to estimate reliably the cash 
flows or the expected life of a financial instrument (or group of financial instruments), the Company uses the contractual cash flows over the full contractual 
term of the financial instrument (or group of financial instruments).3.5.2 Fee and commission incomeThe Company recognizes financial service fees in accordance with the accounting standard of the financial instrument related to the fees earned.270Fees that are an integral part of the effective interest of a financial instrumentSuch fees are generally treated as adjustments of effective interest.  Such fees may include compensation for activities such as evaluating the borrower’s 
financial condition, evaluating and recording guarantees, collateral and other security arrangements, negotiating the terms of the instrument, preparing 
and processing documents and closing the transaction and origination fees received on issuing financial liabilities measured at amortized cost.  However, 
fees relating to the creation or acquisition of a financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss are recognized as revenue immediately.Fees earned as services are providedSuch fees are recognized as revenue as the services are provided.  Fees which can be earned through the certain periods, including account servicing fees, 
investment management fees, and etc, are recognized when the related services are provided.Fees that are earned on the execution of a significant actSuch fees are recognized as revenue when the significant act has been completed.3.5.3 Net gains/losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or lossNet gains/losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss include profit or loss (changes in fair value, dividends, and gain/loss from foreign 
currency translation) from following financial instruments:- Gain or loss from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss 
- Gain or loss from derivatives for trading, including derivatives for hedging that does not meet the condition of hedge accounting3.5.4 Dividend incomeDividend income is recognized in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established.  Dividend income is recognized as relevant items on 
statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in accordance with the classification of equity instruments.3.6 Investments in Subsidiaries and AssociatesInvestments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted at cost method in accordance with Korean IFRS 1027.  The Company determines at each reporting 
period whether there is any objective evidence that the investments in the subsidiaries and associates are impaired.  If this is the case, the Company 
calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the subsidiaries or associates and its carrying value.3.7 Property and EquipmentRecognition and MeasurementAll property and equipment that qualify for recognition as an asset are measured at its cost and subsequently carried at cost less any accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.The cost of property and equipment includes any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be 
capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the 
site on which it is located.Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when they prolong the useful life or enhance values of the assets but the costs of the day-to-day servicing of 
the assets such as repair and maintenance costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.  When part of an item of an asset has a useful life different from 
that of the entire asset, it is recognized as a separate asset.DepreciationLand is not depreciated, whereas other property and equipment are depreciated using the method that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s future 
economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Company.  The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value.Each part of an item of property and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.The depreciation method and estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:Property and equipment
Leasehold improvements
Equipment and vehiclesDepreciation methodDeclining-balance
Declining-balanceEstimated useful life4 years
4 years271The residual value, the useful life and the depreciation method applied to an asset are reviewed at each financial year-end and, if expectations differ from 
previous estimates or if there has been a significant change in the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset, 
the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.8 Intangible AssetsIntangible assets are measured initially at cost and subsequently carried at their cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.Intangible assets, except for membership right, are amortized using the straight-line method with no residual value over their estimated useful economic 
life since the asset is available for use.Intangible assetsSoftware
OthersAmortization methodStraight-line
Straight-lineEstimated useful life4 years4 ~ 19 yearsThe amortization period and the amortization method for intangible assets with a definite or limited useful life are reviewed at each financial year end.  
Where an intangible asset is not being amortized because its useful life is considered to be indefinite, the Company carries out a review in each accounting 
period to confirm whether or not events and circumstances still support the assumption of an indefinite useful life.  If they do not, the change from the 
indefinite to definite or limited useful life is accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.9 Impairment of Non-financial AssetsThe Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset except for (i) deferred income tax 
assets, (ii) assets arising from employee benefits and (iii) non-current assets (or group of assets to be sold) classified as held for sale, may be impaired.  If 
any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.The recoverable amount is estimated for the individual asset.  If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, the Company 
determines the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs (the asset’s cash-generating unit).  A cash-generating unit is 
the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.  
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.  Value in use is the present value of the future cash 
flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit that are discounted by a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.  That 
reduction is an impairment loss and recognized immediately in profit or loss.3.10 ProvisionsProvisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching the best estimate of provisions, and 
where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of provisions are the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to 
settle the obligation.Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.  If it is no longer probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provisions are reversed.3.11 Equity Instrument Issued by the CompanyAn equity instrument is any contract or agreement that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.3.11.1 Ordinary shareOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted, net of tax, from the equity.3.11.2 Hybrid SecuritiesThe financial instruments can be classified as either financial liabilities or equity in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Company classifies hybrid 
securities as an equity if the Company has the unconditional right to avoid any contractual obligation to deliver financial assets such as cash in relation to 
the financial instruments.2723.12 Employee Compensation and Benefits3.12.1 Post-employment benefit:Defined benefit plansAll post-employment benefit, other than defined contribution plans, is classified as defined benefit plans.  The amount recognized as a defined benefit 
liability is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the end of the reporting period.The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit method.  The rate used to 
discount post-employment benefit obligations is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds.  
The currency and term of the corporate bonds are consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment benefit obligations.  Actuarial 
gains and losses including experience adjustments and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in other comprehensive income.When the fair value of plan assets deducted from the total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation results in an asset, it is recognized to the 
extent of any cumulative unrecognized past service cost and the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or 
reductions in future contributions to the plan.Past service cost arises when the Company introduces a defined benefit plan that attributes to past service or changes the benefits payable for past service 
under an existing defined benefit plan.  Such past service cost is recognized immediately in profit or loss.Defined contribution plansThe contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due.3.12.2 Short-term employee benefitsShort-term employee benefits are employee benefits (other than termination benefits) that are due to be settled within 12 months after the end of the 
period in which the employees render the related service.  The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for 
that service is recognized as a liability (accrued expense), after deducting any amount already paid.The expected cost of profit-sharing and bonus payments are recognized as liabilities when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to 
make such payments as a result of past events rendered by employees and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.3.12.3 Share-based paymentThe Company has share grant programs to directors and employees of the Company.  When the stock grants are exercised, the Company can either select 
to distribute newly issued shares or treasury shares, or compensate in cash based on the share price.For a share-based payment transaction in which the terms of the arrangement provide the Company with the choice of whether to settle in cash or by 
issuing equity instruments, the Company determined that it has a present obligation to settle in cash because the Company has a past practice and a stated 
policy of settling in cash.  Therefore, the Company accounts for the transaction in accordance with the requirements of cash-settled share-based payment 
transactions.The Company measures the services acquired and the liability incurred at fair value, and the fair value is recognized as expense and accrued expenses over 
the vesting period.  Until the liability is settled, the Company remeasures the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting period and at the date of 
settlement, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the year.3.12.4 Termination benefitsTermination benefits are employee benefits provided in exchange for the termination of an employee’s employment as a result of either (a) the Company 
decision to terminate an employee’s employment before the normal retirement date; or (b) an employee’s decision to accept an offer of benefits in 
exchange for the termination of employment.  The Company recognizes liabilities and expenses for termination benefits at the earlier of the following 
dates: when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Company recognizes costs for a restructuring that is within the 
scope of Korean IFRS 1037 and involves the payment of termination benefits.  Termination benefits are measured by considering the number of employees 
expected to accept the offer in the case of a voluntary early retirement.  Termination benefits which are not expressed to be settled wholly before 12 
months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present values.3.13 Income Tax ExpensesIncome tax expense comprises current tax expense and deferred income tax expense.  Current and deferred income tax are recognized as income or 
expense and included in profit or loss for the year, except to the extent that the tax arises from (a) a transaction or event which is recognized either in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity and (b) a business combination.273Current income taxCurrent income tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit (loss) for a period.  A difference between the taxable profit and 
accounting profit may arise when income or expense is included in accounting profit in one period but is included in taxable profit in a different period.  
Differences may also arise if there is revenue that is exempt from taxation or expenses that is not deductible in determining taxable profit (loss).  Current 
income tax liabilities (assets) for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be paid to (recovered from) the taxation authorities, 
using the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.The Company offsets current income tax assets and current income tax liabilities if, and only if, the Company (a) has a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognized amounts and (b) intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.Deferred income taxDeferred income tax is recognized, using the asset-liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax based amount of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amount in the financial statements.  Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary difference can be utilized.  However, deferred income tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition 
of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.The carrying amount of a deferred income tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period.  The Company reduces the carrying amount of a 
deferred income tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that 
deferred income tax asset to be utilized.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the period when the asset is realized or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.  The measurement 
of deferred income tax liabilities and deferred income tax assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company 
expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.The Company offsets deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities when the Company has a legally enforceable right to offset current 
income tax assets against current income tax liabilities; and the deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity; or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current income tax 
liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of 
deferred income tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.Uncertain tax positionsUncertain tax positions arise from a claim for rectification brought by the Company, an appeal for a refund of tax levied by the tax authorities, or others 
due to different interpretation of tax laws or others.  The Company recognizes its uncertain tax positions in the separate financial statements based on 
the guidance in Korean IFRS 1012.  The income tax asset is recognized if a tax refund is probable for taxes paid and levied by the tax authority.  However, 
interest and penalties related to income tax are recognized in accordance with Korean IFRS 1037.3.14 Earnings per ShareThe Company calculates basic earnings per share amounts and diluted earnings per share amounts for profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders 
and presents them in the statement of comprehensive income.  Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to ordinary 
equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.  For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, 
the Company adjusts profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the effects of all 
dilutive potential ordinary shares including convertible bond and share option.3.15 LeasesAs explained in Note 2 above, the Company has changed its accounting policy for leases. The impact of the new accounting policies is disclosed in Note 31.Lease income from operating leases where the Company is a lessor is recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs 
incurred in obtaining an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the underlying asset and recognized as expense over the lease term on the 
same basis as lease income. The respective leased assets are included in the statement of financial position based on their nature. The Company did not 
need to make any adjustments to the accounting for assets held as a lessor as a result of adopting the new leasing standard.At inception of a contract, the Company is required to assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Also, at the date of initial application, the 
Company has assessed whether the contract is, or contains, a lease in accordance with the standard. However, the Company did not reassess all contracts 
as the Company elected to apply the practical expedient not to apply the standard to contracts that were not previously identified as containing a lease. On 
the basis of the date of initial application, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease.274A lessee is required to recognize a right-of-use asset (lease assets) representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing 
its obligation to make lease payments. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:- Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable
- Variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate
- Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees
- The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and
- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that optionThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is 
used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment 
with similar terms and conditions.Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:- The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
- Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received
- Any initial direct costs, and
- Restoration costsHowever, short-term lease (lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less) and lease of low-value assets (For example, 
underlying leased asset under $ 5,000) are permitted to elect exceptional conditions.The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term.Related to sale and leaseback, an entity (seller-lessee) is required to applying Korean IFRS 1115 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ to determine 
whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale of that asset. However, the Company has not reassessed sale and leaseback transactions entered 
into before the date of initial application.3.16 Operating SegmentsThe Company is composed of a single operating segment.  Therefore, disclosures on segments are omitted in accordance with Korean IFRS 1108, Operating Segments.4. Financial Risk Management
4.1 Summary4.1.1 Overview of financial risk management policyThe financial risks that the Company is exposed to are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and others.The note regarding financial risk management provides information about the risks that the Company is exposed to, including the objectives, policies, 
assessment and management process of risks.  Additional quantitative information is disclosed throughout the separate financial statements.The Company’s risk management system focuses on increasing transparency, developing the risk management environment, and the preemptive response 
to risk due to rapid changes in the financial environment to support the Company’s long-term strategy and business decisions efficiently. Credit risk, market 
risk and liquidity risk have been recognized as the Company’s key risks. These risks are measured and managed in Internal Capital or VaR (Value at Risk) 
using a statistical method.4.1.2 Risk management organizationRisk Management CommitteeThe Risk Management Committee establishes risk management strategies in accordance with the directives of the Board of Directors and determines the 
Company’s target risk appetite. The committee approves significant risk matters and reviews the level of risks that the Company is exposed to and the 
appropriateness of the Company’s risk management operations as an ultimate decision-making authority.275Risk Management CouncilThe Risk Management Council is a consultative group which reviews and makes decisions on matters delegated by the Risk Management Committee, and 
discusses the detailed issues relating to the Company’s risk management.Risk Management DivisionThe Risk Management Division is responsible for conducting detailed policies, procedures and working processes relating to the Company’s risk management.4.2 Credit Risk4.2.1 Overview of credit riskCredit risk is the risk of possible losses in an asset portfolio in the event of counterparty’s default, breach of contract and deterioration in the credit quality 
of the counterparty. For risk management reporting purposes, the individual borrower’s default risk is considered.4.2.2 Credit risk managementThe Company measures expected losses on assets that are subject to credit risk management and uses it as a management indicator.4.2.3 Maximum exposure to credit riskThe Company’s maximum exposures of financial instruments to credit risk without consideration of collateral values as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:Due from financial institutions

than financial asset at fair value through profit or loss and recognizes loss allowance. Expected credit losses are a probability-weighted estimate of possible 
credit losses within certain range by reflecting reasonable and supportable information that is reasonably available at the reporting date without undue cost 
or effort, including information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. For financial assets at amortized cost, 
the Company measures the expected credit losses and presents it in the financial statements netting the allowance from the related loans; for financial 
assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the Company presents it in the statements using other comprehensive income.Credit risk exposureLoans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, are classified as follows:The financial

344,302Liquidity risk is a risk that the Company becomes insolvent due to uncertain liquidity caused by unexpected cash outflows, or a risk of borrowing high 
interest debts or disposal of liquid and other assets at a substantial discount. The Company manages its liquidity risk through analysis of the contractual 
maturity of interest-bearing assets and liabilities, assets and liabilities related to the other cash flow, and off-balance sheet items related to cash flow of 
currency derivative instruments and others.Cash flows disclosed for the maturity analysis are undiscounted contractual principal and interest to be received (paid) and; thus, are not identical to the 
amount in the financial statements that are based on the present value of expected cash flows in some cases. The amount of interest to be received or paid 
on floating rate assets and liabilities is measured on the assumption that the current interest rate would be the same through the maturity.4.3.2. Liquidity risk managementThe liquidity risk is managed by liquidity management principles and related guidelines which are applied to the risk management policies and procedures 
that address all the possible risks that arise from the overall business of the Company.2794.3.3.

2 Hybrid securities included in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are included in the ‘Over 5 years’ category since the point of disposal is uncertain.4.4 Market Risk4.4.1 ConceptMarket risk is the risk of possible losses which arise from changes in market factors; such as, interest rate, stock price, foreign exchange rate and other 
market factors that affect the fair value of future cash flows of financial instruments. The most significant risk of the Company is interest rate risk.4.4.2 Interest rate riskDefinition of interest rate riskInterest rate risk is the risk that may occur due to changes in interest rates; such as, the value (fair value) change risk in statement of financial position line 
items and cash flow change risk in interest income and expense arising from investing and financing activities.280Observation method and management indicator on interest rate riskThe main objective of interest rate risk management is to protect asset values against interest rate fluctuations. The Company manages the risk through 
measurement and management of Value at Risk for the interest rate.Interest Rate VaRInterest rate VaR is the maximum possible loss due to interest rate risk at a 99.9% confidence level.  The measurement results of risk as of December 31, 
2019 and 2018, are as follows:Interest rate VaR4.5 Capital Adequacy(In millions of Korean won)20192018\146,472\149,774The Company complies with the capital adequacy standard established by the Financial Services Commission.  The capital adequacy standard is based 
on Basel III published by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Bank for International Settlements in June 2011, and was implemented in Korea in 
December 2013.  The Company is required to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 8.0%(2018: 7.125%), a minimum Tier 1 ratio of 
9.5%(2018: 8.625%) and a minimum Total Regulatory Capital ratio of 11.5%(2018: 10.625%) as of December 31, 2019.The Company’s equity capital is classified into three categories in accordance with the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory Regulations on 
Financial Holding Companies as below:-  Common Equity Tier 1 Capital: Common equity Tier 1 Capital represents the issued capital that takes the first and proportionately greatest share of any 
losses and represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the Company, and not repaid outside of liquidation.  It includes common shares issued, 
capital surplus, retained earnings, non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, accumulated other comprehensive income, other capital surplus 
and others.-  Additional Tier 1 Capital: Additional Tier 1 Capital includes (i) perpetual instruments issued by the Company that meet the criteria for inclusion inAdditional Tier 1 capital, and (ii) stock surplus resulting from the issue of instruments included in Additional Tier 1 capital and others.-  Tier 2 Capital: Tier 2 Capital represents the capital that takes the proportionate share of losses in the liquidation of the Company.  Tier 2 Capital includes 
a fund raised by issuing subordinated debentures maturing in not less than 5 years that meet the criteria for inclusion in Additional Tier 2 capital, and 
the allowance for loan losses which are accumulated for assets classified as normal or precautionary as a result of classification of asset soundness in 
accordance with Regulation on Supervision of Financial Holding Companies and others.Risk weighted asset means the inherent risks in the total assets held by the Company. The Company calculates risk weighted asset by each risk (credit risk, 
market risk, and operational risk) based on the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory Regulations on Financial Holding Companies and uses it 
for BIS ratio calculation.The Company assesses and monitors its adequacy of capital by using the internal assessment and management policy of the capital adequacy.  The 
assessment of the capital adequacy is conducted by comparing available capital (actual amount of available capital) and Internal Capital (amount of capital 
enough to cover all significant risks under target credit rate set by the Company).  The Company monitors the soundness of finance and provides risk 
adjusted basis for performance review using the assessment of the capital adequacy.Internal Capital is the amount of capital to prevent the inability of payment due to unexpected loss in the future.  The Company measures, allocates and 
monitors Internal Capital by risk type and subsidiaries.The Risk Management Council of the Company determines the Company’s risk appetite and allocates Internal Capital by risk type and subsidiary.  Each 
subsidiary efficiently operates its capital within a range of allocated Internal Capital.  The Risk Management Department of the Company monitors the limit 
on Internal Capital and reports the results to management and the Risk Management Council.  The Company maintains the adequacy of capital through 
proactive review and approval of the Risk Management Committee when the Internal Capital is expected to exceed the limits due to new business or 
business expansion.281Details of the Company’s capital adequacy calculation in line with Basel III, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:Equity Capital:

 5,718,609282Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability could be settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length 
transaction. For each class of financial assets and financial liabilities, the Company discloses the fair value of that class of assets and liabilities in a way that 
permits it to be compared with its carrying amount at the end of each reporting period. The best evidence of fair value of financial instruments is quoted 
price in an active market.Methods of determining fair value of financial instruments are as follows:Cash and due from financial  
   institutionsThe carrying amounts of cash and demand due from financial institutions and payment due from financial institutions 
are a reasonable approximation of fair values. These financial instruments do not have a fixed maturity and are 
receivable on demand. Fair value of ordinary due from financial institutions is measured using DCF model.Investment securitiesDerivativesLoans at amortized costDebtsDebenturesOther financial assets  
   and liabilitiesFair value hierarchyThe fair value of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets is determined using the quoted prices. 
Fair value is determined through the use of external professional valuation institution where quoted prices are not 
available. The institutions use one or more of the following valuation techniques including DCF Model, Free Cash Flow 
to Equity Model, Imputed Market Value Model, Dividend Discount Model, Risk Adjusted Discount Rate Method, and 
Net Asset Value Method.
For exchange traded derivatives, quoted price in an active market is used to determine fair value and for OTC 
derivatives, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. The Company uses internally developed valuation 
models that are widely used by market participants to determine fair values of plain vanilla OTC derivatives including 
options, interest rate swaps, and currency swaps, based on observable market parameters. However, some complex 
financial instruments are valued using appropriate models developed from generally accepted market valuation 
models including the Finite Difference Method and the Monte Carlo Simulation or valuation results from independent 
external professional valuation institution.
DCF model is used to determine the fair value of loans. Fair value is determined by discounting the expected cash 
flows, which are contractual cash flows adjusted by the expected prepayment rate, at appropriate discount rate.DCF model is used to determine the fair value of debts, but in the case of short-term maturity, the carrying amount is 
used as the fair value.
Fair value is determined by using the valuations of external professional valuation institution, which are calculated 
using market inputs.
The carrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair values.  These financial instruments are temporary accounts 
used for other various transactions and their maturities are relatively short or not defined.The Company believes that valuation methods used for measuring the fair values of financial instruments are reasonable and that the fair values recognized 
in the statement of financial position are appropriate. However, the fair values of the financial instruments recognized in the statement of financial position 
may be different if other valuation methods or assumptions are used. Additionally, as there is a variety of valuation techniques and assumptions used in 
measuring fair value, it may be difficult to reasonably compare the fair value with that of other financial institutions.The Company classifies and discloses fair value of the financial instruments into the three-level hierarchy as follows:Level 1Level 2 
Level 3The fair values are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date.
The fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The fair values are based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.When the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value 
measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. 
Assessing the significance of a particular input to the entire measurement requires judgment, taking into account factors specific to the asset or liability. 
If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 
measurement.283Fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statements of financial positionThe fair value hierarchy of financial assets measured at fair value in the statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:Financial assets

5,718,6091  Because due from financial institutions classified as level 2 are deposits on demand, carrying amounts   are reasonable approximations of fair values. And due from financial 
institutions classified as level 3 are due from financial institutions with residual maturity of less than 3 months, carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values.
2 Because loans at amortized cost classified as level 3 are loans with residual maturity of less than one year, carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values.
3 For other financial assets and other financial liabilities classified as level 3, carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values.
4 Since the remaining maturity of debts classified as level 2 is less than a year, carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values.Valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurementFor financial assets and liabilities whose carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value, we do not disclose valuation techniques and inputs.Valuation techniques and inputs of financial assets and liabilities whose fair values are disclosed and classified as Level 2 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018,

affected by the unobservable parameters, using a statistical technique. When the fair value is affected by more than two input parameters, the amounts 
represent the most favorable or most unfavorable outcome. There are hybrid securities whose fair value changes are recognized in profit or loss.The results of the sensitivity analysis from changes in inputs are as follows:(In millions of Korean won)Financial assets

Net Defined Benefit Liabilities
Defined benefit planThe Company operates defined benefit plans which have the following characteristics:- The Company has the obligation to pay the agreed benefits to all its current and former employees.
- Actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more than expected) and investment risk fall, in substance, on the Company.The net defined benefit liability recognized in the statements of financial position is calculated in accordance with actuarial valuation methods using market 
data; such as, interest rates, future salary increase rate and mortality rate based on historical data. Actuarial assumptions may differ from actual results, due 
to changes in the market, economic trends and mortality trends.Changes in the defined benefit obligation for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:Present value of definedbenefit obligation2019Fair value of

and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.  The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in principal actuarial assumptions is 
calculated using the projected unit credit method, the same method applied when calculating the defined benefit obligations recognized on the statement 
of financial position.Expected maturity analysis of undiscounted pension benefits (including expected future benefits) as of December 31, 2019, are as follows:Up to

Our responsibility is to express opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted the audit in accordance 
with Korean Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective 
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.An audit of internal control over financial reporting involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about whether a material weakness exists. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks that a material weakness exists. An audit includes obtaining 
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over 
financial reporting based on the assessed risk.315Definition and Inherent Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
An entity’s internal control over financial reporting is a process effected by those charged with governance, management, and other personnel, designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the Republic of Korea. An entity’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the Republic of Korea, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of management and those charged with governance; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention, or timely detection and 
correction of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements. Also, projections of any 
assessment of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Yeob Yu, Certified Public Accountant.Samil PricewaterhouseCoopersSeoul, Korea
