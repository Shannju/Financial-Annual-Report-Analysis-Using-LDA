contributed to corporate profit growth and market share performance. As monetary 
policies  normalize  across  the  world’s  major  central  banks,  European  economies 
managed to achieve better-than-expected recovery, while the USD index weakened 
due to Fed’s halt on further rate hike. Stimulated by the global recovery, Taiwan’s 
economy expanded by more than 2% for the year, attracting an inflow of foreign 
capital that strengthened the NTD currency. Taiwan should continue to benefit from 
global expansion in 2018, but uncertainties associated with tightened liquidity and 
rising trade protectionism worldwide and the outlook of the NTD currency will all 
pose a challenge to Taiwan’s economic growth in the coming year.Despite intensifying volatility and competition within the global market, the 
Bank still managed to maintain high growth by relying on its extensive experience 
and strong business team. Not only has the Bank out-performed peers in earnings, 
the organization also won recognition from local and foreign major awards such as: 
Euromoney - “Best Bank in Taiwan 2017,” The Asian Banker - “Best Credit Card 
Product” and “Best Retail Risk Management Initiative,” Asian Banking & Finance 
- “Taiwan Domestic Trade Finance Bank of the Year,” The Asset” - “Best Private 
Bank,  Taiwan,”  and  Wealth  Magazine  -  “Best  Wealth  Management”  and  “Best 
Digital  Service.”  It  is  evident  that  financial  products  and  services  offered  by  the 
Bank have been well-perceived by experts local and abroad.In the domestic market, the Bank offers diverse and complete services via a 
comprehensive  banking  network,  and  currently  operates  the  highest  number  of 
branches as a private banking institution in Taiwan. At the end of 2017, the Bank 
had a total of 164 branches located throughout Taiwan. With respect to key overseas 
markets,  the  Bank  currently  operates  1  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  1  joint  venture 
bank, 12 branches (sub-branches), and 5 representative offices in total. In the China 
market,  the  Bank  has  adopted  the  approach  of  connecting  local  sub-branches  to 
create  a  complete  service  network  that  caters  to  the  local  market.  Meanwhile, 
actions are being taken to establish and re-organize subsidiary banks to maximize 
business  opportunities. As  for  the  Southeast Asian  market,  the  Bank  has  already 
established presence in 9 of the 10 ASEAN countries, making it the Taiwanese bank 
with  the  broadest  service  coverage  in  Southeast Asia. The  Bank  is  committed  to 
investing  group  resources  into  key  markets  and  bringing  diverse,  quality  and 
complete financial services to local customers either through branch establishment 
or strategic alliance.1In  terms  of  innovation,  integration  between  banking  service  and  digital 
technology remains the primary focus, given the wide popularity of mobile devices. 
In  addition  to  being  the  first  wave  of  banks  to  support Apple  Pay,  the  Bank  also 
extended support for Samsung Pay and Android Pay devices, and adopted big data 
technologies  to  develop  its  own  artificial  decision-making  logic  for  various 
consumer  banking  products  and  services.  This  new  technology  even  led  to  the 
development  of  smart  investment  services  that  are  aimed  toward  providing 
customers with better digital experience and added value.For  more  effective  fulfillment  of  corporate  social  responsibilities,  the  Bank 
transformed into Taiwan’s first Equator Bank in 2015 and has since been combining 
financial expertise with environmental issues to support a low-carbon economy. The 
Bank has long been supporting domestic and foreign solar energy industries through 
project  lending,  while  exerting  positive  influence  as  a  financial  institution  to 
minimize impact of industrial activities on the environment and society.Talent is the foundation for future growth in a market environment so full of 
opportunities and challenges at the same time, and the Bank’s dedication to training 
talent  was  recognized  by  the  Association  for  Talent  Development  in  its  BEST 
Awards  in  2017.  In  the  future,  the  Bank  will  continue  integrating  resources 
throughout the financial group to build a stronger organization, and actively expand 
business in size and scope under rigorous risk control and strict compliance with 
local as well as foreign laws to fulfill its long-term vision.II.  2017 business reportChanges in the local and foreign financial environment and outcomes of theBank’s business plan and strategy for 2017 are explained below:(I)Consumer banking serviceThe  Bank  has  been  improving  basic  services  to  customers  by 
adopting  a  needs-driven  approach.  With  a  comprehensive  network  of 
physical and digital channels available at its disposal, the Bank is able to 
introduce integrated financial services and the ultimate one-stop shopping 
experience  for  customers.  The  Bank  also  cooperated  pro-actively  with 
other subsidiaries of the financial group to introduce new digital services, 
source new customers and attract deposits into the Bank. This enhanced 
coordination  has  generated  synergies  and  created  financial  service 
opportunities  that  were  favorably  reflected  in  terms  of  profitability, 
competitiveness, and customer scale.With  regards  to  housing  loans,  the  Bank  continued  to  focus  on 
stability  and  credit  quality  by  making  optimal  adjustments  to  customer 
structure and capital utilization. As for unsecured lending, steps were taken2to  expand  target  customers  and  distribution,  including  the  use  of  digital 
channels, and to explore high-margin lending opportunities for improved 
profitability.The Bank’s deposit balance amounted to NT$2,808 billion at the end 
of  2017,  up  NT$66.2  billion  and  3.3%  from  the  end  of  2016,  and

cooperated with Family Mart and 85°C Cafe, respectively, to integrate 
credit card and debit card with APPs of the two major retail chains for 
express  payment  and  membership  point  collection.  By  introducing 
exclusive  mobile  payment  features  to  the  two  merchants,  consumers 
are able to complete transactions entirely over their mobile phone, and 
thereby relieve storekeepers of the hassle associated with cash handling 
while  helping  merchants  realize  their  vision  of  a  cashless  business 
model.3. Automated channels: In addition to maintaining an exclusive presence 
at Taipei Metro Stations, the Bank managed to expand its service reach 
and obtain exclusive right to place ATMs in FamilyMart and PXMart 
chains.  The  Bank  is  also  in  the  midst  of  negotiating  with  the  above 
partners  to  introduce  cash  flow  and  digital  payment  services.  By  the 
end of 2017, the Bank had deployed 3,201 ATMs, ranking 3rd with a 
market share of 11.31%.3(III)  Credit card service1. Utilizing an  AI-driven  decision-making  model,  the  Bank  was  able  to

contribution.2. Total outstanding cards exceeded 6 million in 2017 while the number 
of  active  cards  reached  4.36  million,  ranking  first  in  the  market.  In

experience and loyalty among cardholders.(IV)  Wealth management serviceIn terms of wealth management service, the Bank continued to offer asset

many  of  the  Bank’s  initiatives  including  differentiated  customer

businesses  such  as  hotels  to  accommodate  the  mandatory  trust 
requirements imposed by law. The size of charity trust expanded 26% 
from  2016  to  NT$37.9  billion  in  2017;  total  assets  managed  under

young  customers  (99%  of  cardholders  had  applied  for  digital

product  suitability  assessments  in  accordance  with  Article  3  of  the6amended “Regulations Governing Offshore Structured Products” released 
by  FSC  on  March  3,  2017  for  all  transactions  involving  derivatives  in

experience,  wealth,  trading  purpose,  product  knowledge  and  suitability

Future strategies(I)  Consumer banking service1. Introduce integrated financial products with the support of group resources,and create synergy from coordination with affiliated branches.2. Optimize services from a “customer experience” standpoint across physical 
and digital channels; introduce differentiated financial services for specific 
customers and strengthen relationship with simpler, faster and more refined 
services for improvement of overall operating performance.3. Strengthen  customer  relationship  management  and  enhance  cross-sellingefforts to maximize customer value and prevent the loss of customers.4. Grow  e-commerce  service  by  integrating  across  devices,  platforms  and 
physical/virtual  channels;  provide  digital  cash  flow  service  and  enhance 
account  collection/payment  functions  to  become  customers’  primary 
banker.5. The Bank will be adding a new target customer group called “Sophisticated 
Customers”  to  expand  its  corporate  customer  and  related  business 
opportunities, whereas an SME Transformation Program will be launched 
with a dedicated SME team assembled to provide differentiated services. 
The  team  will  also  be  cooperating  with  branches  to  satisfy  the  needs  of 
personal/corporate  banking  customers  with  a  “professional”  and 
“localized” focus. A dedicated credit assessment team will be assembled to 
serve as a centralized hub for all credit assessments throughout the nation, 
and  thereby  improve  efficiency  and  quality  of  the  credit  assessment 
process. By bringing credit assessment from the back office toward the mid-
office,  we  hope  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  our  internal  procedures  and 
enhance customers’ experience.(II)  Financial Payment Service1. Transaction acquisition: The Bank plans to grow this market by applying 
different strategies for different categories of merchant, including “strategic 
merchant,”  “total  solution  merchant”  and  “acquisition-only  merchant.” 
This  relationship  would  also  enable  other  group  affiliates  to  extend  cash 
flow  services  such  as  salary  transfer,  mortgage,  personal  loan,  insurance 
etc. to the merchants for risk reduction and strengthened loyalty at the same 
time.  Furthermore,  new  terminal  equipment  incorporating  e-ticket  and 
third-party payment services will be introduced to serve as incentives for 
merchants.132. New  payment  service:  The  Bank  will  continue  seeking  cooperation  with 
prominent  channels  and  merchants,  and  incorporate  the  latest  financial 
technologies  to  open  up  new  financial  service  opportunities  and  provide 
merchants  with  total  solutions,  thereby  bringing  innovative  banking  into 
people’s lives.3. Automated  channels:  Adhere  to  the  “customer  experience”  focus  andenhance cash flow services in ways that improve channel performance.(III)  Credit card service1. By identifying the needs of target customers and offering suitable products 
at high precision, the Bank will be cross-selling on a larger scale to acquire 
high net worth and young customers. With a solid customer base, the Bank 
will be able to assure the sustainability and competitiveness of its business.2. Alliances  will  be  formed  with  strategic  partners  to  expand  payment 
scenarios,  whereas  lifestyle  banking  services  will  be  developed  based  on 
customer  experience  to  create  a  financial  ecosystem  that  benefits  both 
consumers and merchants.3. Given the Bank’s leading advantage in mobile payment, more attention will 
be  devoted  toward  exploring  application  of  wearable  devices  and 
development  of  digital  credit  cards  that  would  strengthen  customers’ 
loyalty and the competitiveness of the Bank.4. In addition to exploring new payment scenarios, the Bank will also adopt 
the  use  of  big  data  to  offer  customized  privileges  and  raise  service 
experience, which in turn improves brand differentiation and awareness.(IV)  Wealth management service1.  Differentiated customer management: As part of the Bank’s emphasis on 
diverse asset allocation, a professional team of financial consultants will be 
assembled  to  provide  total  investment  advisory  service,  including 
customized  asset  allocation  plans  aimed  at  helping  customers  build  up 
assets and realize investment goals for a mutual win.2.  Enhanced financial advisory: The Bank will aim to ensure quick response 
to  market  and  customer  demands,  offer  differentiated  financial  advisory, 
provide  suitable  and  relevant  products,  services  and 
investment 
information,  assist  customers  with  trading  needs,  and  introduce  smart 
investment tools for a better digital experience.14(V)Corporate banking serviceThe Bank will strategically strengthen corporate customers’ attachment and 
revenue  contribution,  expand  into  Greater  China  and  key  Southeast Asian 
markets,  develop  conglomerate  management,  enhance  group-wide  risk 
management,  offer  total  financial  service  to  customers  and  aim  toward 
becoming a regional financial institution in the Asia Pacific.(VI)  Foreign currency serviceThrough expansion of foreign currency product line, optimization of foreign 
exchange  platform,  integration  of  physical  and  virtual  channels  and 
introduction of diverse foreign currency services, the Bank aims to increase 
the efficiency of customers’ capital allocation as well as their attachment to 
the Bank’s services, which ultimately improves the Bank’s competitiveness 
in the international market.(VII)  Digital banking servicesGiven  FSC’s  ongoing  encouragement  for  financial  innovation  and  digital 
banking, the Bank will continue development of new financial products and 
services  and  incorporate  them  into  virtual  as  well  as  physical  channels  for 
enhanced digital experience. Assistance will also be given to help employees 
transform and develop innovative capacity.(VIII)  Overseas operations1. The  Bank  will  aim  to  expand  its  customer  base  overseas  through  active 
deployment  of  overseas  channels,  planning,  training  overseas  talent, 
implementation  of  robust  platform  and  procedures,  and  offering 
differentiated and diverse products.2. The  Bank  as  a  whole  will  be  growing  overseas  markets  and  deploying 
branches  in  line  with  government  policies,  while  adopting  a  localized 
business  strategy  at  various  locations.  In  the  meantime,  the  Head  Office 
will escalate management efforts and assistance to overseas operations to 
ensure that proper frameworks and models are implemented. A high-quality 
and  complete  range  of  financial  services  will  be  introduced  to  meet  the 
needs of regional customers and to connect with international standards; by 
increasing the percentage of overseas profits, the Bank strives to become a 
leading financial institution in the Asia Pacific.3. Resources  will  be  coordinated  throughout  the  Bank  to  create  synergiesbetween overseas operations and support local business development at the15same time. In doing so, the Bank hopes to identify growth opportunities inoverseas markets and develop new products that not only take advantage ofdemographic  dividends,  but  increase  brand  visibility  internationally  aswell.  If  laws  permit,  the  Bank  may  even  engage  overseas  partners  instrategic  cooperative  relationships  through  arrangements  such  as  equityownership, merger, acquisition, or joint ventures.V.  Impacts of the competitive environment, regulatory environment,and overall business environment(I)  External competitionHaving  predicted  stable  recovery  in  Europe  and  USA  combined  withincreased growth in Asian emerging markets, the International Monetary Fundexpects  the  global  economy  to  sustain  strong  growth  in  the  coming  year.Although  the  market  is  generally  optimistic  toward  the  outlook  of  theeconomy,  the  fact  that  governments  are  turning  away  from  expansionarymonetary  policy  and  increasing  geopolitical  risks  present  uncertainties  toeconomic growth. For this reason, the Bank will focus its operating strategieslargely  on  the  control  of  credit  exposure,  while  targeting  service  fees  andcross-selling as the main sources of income, and monitor market changes withcaution.Mobile  technology  and  digital  transformation  continue  to  challengetraditional  banking  practices  and  intensify  competition  within  the  industry.Meanwhile, the government has been actively introducing deregulations andcreating collaborative opportunities as a means to inspire financial creativityand growth. Given how digital banking has flourished, conventional practicesand  channels  alone  could  no  longer  satisfy  customers’  needs  for  financialproducts  and  services;  furthermore,  ongoing  deregulation  and  policyincentives have attracted banking institutions to direct investment toward newareas and undertake transformations that are gradually changing how banksare run today. In addition to introducing a multitude of online banking servicesand  satisfying  customers’  needs  with  a  customer-centric  “full  channelnetwork,” the Bank also incorporates digital and social networking featuresinto its financial service for enhanced user experience, which in turn benefitscustomers and the Bank at the same time.Competition  for  overseas  businesses  has  already  intensified  asgovernments in the Greater China Region and Southeast Asia have  become16more  open  to  foreign  investors;  additionally,  technology  and  internetcompanies are also finding ways to compete for financial service, escalatingthe competition to an unprecedented level. In response to the new competitivelandscape,  the  Bank  will  actively  explore  the  needs  of  local  customers  andcontinue to satisfy them by delivering the best experience and more innovativeservices.(II)  The regulatory environmentGiven  the  supervisory  trend  in  Asia  Pacific,  we  expect  financialsupervision to tighten across all local authorities, for which the Bank will berequired  to  respond  with  enhanced  information  security  measures,  a  morerobust business continuity plan, rigorous anti-money laundering and counterfinancing  of  terrorism  (AML/CFT)  practices,  and  more  thorough  customerdue  diligence  investigation.  While  these  requirements  pose  additionalcompliance  costs,  they  also  present  opportunities  to  align  banking  practicewith international standards.The  Bank  continues  to  enforce  its  compliance  and  internal  controlsystems  in  line  with  international  supervisory  trends  and  instructions  of  thehome  country  authority,  and  makes  timely  changes  to  internal  policies  toensure  conformity  with  external  regulations.  In  preparation  for  the  mutualevaluation by the “Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering” (APG) in 2018,the  Bank  has  implemented  a  “risk-based”  management  framework  thatintroduces  a  number  of  emphases  including  enhanced  identification  andassessment  of  ML/FTrisk,  enhanced  know-your-customer(KYC)investigation, suspicious transaction monitoring and reporting, and optimizedAML  system  for  more  effective  combat  against  money  laundering  andterrorism  financing  activities.  The  Bank  has  programs  in  place  to  helpemployees react to FSC’s policy on financial technologies (FinTech), and paysclose  attention  to  the  legislative  progress  of  FSC’s  “Financial  TechnologyDevelopment and Innovative Experimentation Act” (commonly referred to as“Regulatory  Sandbox”) and application of regulatory technology (RegTech)so that innovative financial services, products and risk management measurescan be introduced in conformity with ongoing trends to take advantage of newmarket  opportunities  while  at  the  same  time  contribute  to  the  long-termgrowth, risk control, integrity, innovation, and sustainability of the financialindustry as a whole.The  FSC  has  relaxed  the  “Capital  Requirement  Risk  Weight”  on  realestate  loans  in  favor  of  local  banks  since  December  31,  2017.  This  new17measure  not  only  frees  up  resources  for  financial  institutions  to  expandbusiness, but also allows capital to be allocated more efficiently to competeon a global scale.(III)  The overall business environmentOverall,  the  global  economy  is  expected  to  sustain  its  current  rate  ofexpansion, and according to an analysis by the Central Bank, future economicoutlook  remains  positive  with  leading  indicators  suggesting  further  growthrecovery driven by the manufacturing sector in 2018. However, global tradegrowth  may  level  due  to  weakened  demand  from  China  relative  to  theprevious  year,  which  puts  world’s  major  economies  at  risk  of  an  economicdownturn.  In  response,  the  Bank  will  continue  supporting  multi-nationalcorporate customers with timely advisory and helping them weather throughchallenging times.The  Bank  remains  committed  to  maintaining  stability,  and  strives  todevelop banking relationship with diverse customers of good credit quality.The organization uses risk-weighted returns and eliminates non-performers tooptimize  its  portfolio;  percentage  of  high-margin  loans  is  constantlymonitored  for  improved  profitability.  More  complete  financial  services  andaccount  features  are  being  offered  to  customers  as  well  as  a  solid  depositsbase,  while  providing  demand-oriented  integrated  products.  The  Bank  alsotakes advantage of group synergy by cross-selling through platforms of otherCathay subsidiaries online as well as offline to attract new capital.VI.

Bank profileI.  Date of EstablishmentJanuary 4, 1975II.  Bank historyThe  United  World  Chinese  Commercial  Bank  (UWCCB)  and  CathayCommercial Bank (CCB) was merged and renamed Cathay United Bank. UWCCBwas  found  in  September  1971  during  the  4th  Cathay  Financial  AssociationGathering where representatives of Chinese  entrepreneurs  around the world gavetheir determined support to the economy of their motherland. A total of 17 nationaland  regional  overseas  Chinese  leaders  as  well  as  17  members  of  The  BankersAssociation of Taipei provided 50% of the investment shares to establish UWCCB.In May 1974, the Conference of Sponsors was convened, creating a bank with anapproved capital sum of US$ 12 million. Shares would be divided into equal halvesto  domestic  shareholders  and  overseas  shareholders.  In  December  1974,  theMinistry  of  Finance  submitted  the  relevant  applications  to  the  Executive  Yuan,which then approved the establishment of Cathay United Bank. UWCCB flagshipoffice  at  No.  10, Yongsui  Street, Taipei  City  formally  opened  for  business  on  20May  1975.  Cathay  United  Bank  later  acquired  Overseas  Chinese  Trust  andInvestment Co., Ltd. on 17 April 1995.Cathay Commercial Bank (CCB) was originally founded as the First Trust andInvestment Co., Ltd. which established in June 1971. The reelection of the entireboard of directors and election of Chen-yu Tsai as Chairperson of the Board in 1993served  as  a  turning  point  for  this  Company.  Mr.  Tsai  initiated  the  5-YearReformation  Program  and  successfully  renamed  the  Company  as  HuitongCommercial Bank Co., Ltd. on 16 November 1998. Cathay United Bank was laterrenamed as Cathay Commercial Bank (CCB) on 3 July 2002.We  have  initiated  financial  reformations  in  response  to  the  government'sFinancial  Holding  Company  Act.  Since  Taiwan's  entry  to  the  World  TradeOrganization  (WTO),  we  have  faced  intense  competition  from  multinationalfinancial  conglomerates.  We  thus  provided  our  clients  with  improved  andcomprehensive  financial  services.  Both  Cathay  Commercial  Bank  (CCB)  andUnited  World  Chinese  Commercial  Bank  (UWCCB)  joined  Cathay  FinancialHoldings Co., Ltd. in 22 April 2002 and 18 December 2002 respectively, becomingtwo wholly-owned subsidiary banks under Cathay Financial Holdings. To maximize19the  combined  performance  of  Cathay  Financial  Holding,  we  have  implementedmeasures  such  as  integrating  the  resources  of  the  two  banks,  streamliningoperational  costs,  improving  operational  efficiency,  and  expanded  our  services.Both  UWCCB  and  CCB  have  been  merged  in  compliance  with  the  FinancialInstitution  Merger Act  and  other  relevant  laws.  UWCCB  would  be  the  survivingcompany  while  CCB  would be dissolved in  the  merger. The  merger contract  andother associated issues were resolved and passed in the Board of Directors meetingon 21 April 2003 and approved in 26 June by the Ministry of Finance. The referencedate for the merger was 27 October 2003. The merged bank was renamed “CathayUnited Bank Co., Ltd.”.To  expand  the  scope  of  services  provided  and  our  market  share,  we  thenacquired Diqi Shangye Yinhang (Seventh  Commercial  Bank) on 1 January 2007.Further  growth  was  achieved  by  accepting  specific  asset  debt  balances  andoperations of Zhonglian Xintuo on 29 December 2007. Since these acquisitions andmergers, Cathay United Bank has  continued  to expand its local branch offices inTaiwan, becoming a private bank with the largest number (164) of branches.20Three.

If the Bank has established corporate social responsibility principles based on “Corporate Social Responsibility Best Practice Principlesfor TWSE/TPEx Listed Companies”, please describe any discrepancy between the principles and their implementation: 
In light of rising CSR awareness throughout the world, Cathay FHC not only assembled a  “Corporate Sustainability (CS) Committee” 
directly under its board of directors but also assigned independent directors to supervise corporate sustainability-related affairs.VI.  Other information material to the understanding of the implementation of corporate social responsibility:(I)  The  Bank  was  the  pioneer  in  the  financial  industry,  starting  with  the  establishment  of  Cathay  United  Bank  Foundation  in  1980 
followed by the founding of Cathay United Art Center in 2000. Driven by its mission to “give back to society,” the Bank has since 
been active in public  welfare activities including offering study  aid,  supporting charity  sponsorship,  holding cultural/arts/charity 
events, and consignment charity. The Bank is highly committed in fulfilling corporate social responsibilities and organizes charity 
events through Cathay United Bank Foundation. A list of major events organized by the Foundation in 2017 are presented as follows:1. “Elevated Tree Program－  Grow A Big Tree From A Shoot” series:① Elevated Tree Program Scholarship:In April and October, the Foundation made 2 donations under the Elevated Tree Program for a total of NT$10 million.

tragic  events.  Donations  were  made  to  713  elementary  and  junior  high  schools  in  Miaoli  County,  Changhua  County, Yunlin 
County, Chiayi County, Taitung County and Yilan County to a total of 6,937 beneficiaries. Since the program started in 2004, 
more than NT$145 million in donations have been made to the benefit of nearly 93,000 children. Cathay United Bank Chu Lai

Lai Branch and the foundation jointly donated VND 590 million in scholarship that benefited 980 people.②Donating coats in collaboration with Ever Shine Y&F Co., Ltd. and Ever Shine I&F Co., Ltd.:Ever Shine Y&F and Ever Shine I&F are two of the world’s top-20 suppliers of fabric materials, and are two very important 
customers  to  Cathay  United  Bank.  Ever  Shine  Y&F  Chairman  Johnny  Shen  and  Ever  Shine  I&F  Chairman  Sally  Yeh  had 
sponsored the “Elevated Tree Program” through action, donating nearly  3,600 winter coats to students in remote  locations in 
2017.③ Elevated Tree Program Public Welfare Lectures:15 lectures were held in Taipei City, Taichung City and Taitung County to an audience size of nearly 2,900 people. Since the 
Program first began in 2008, more than 140 lecture sessions have been held to an audience size of more than 20,000 people.④ Love Without Barriers:In order to fully preserve the contents of “Elevated Tree Program Public Welfare,” the Bank published the 5th volume of “Love 
Without  Barriers,”  which  features  a  collection  of  knowledge  verbally  communicated  by  experts  and  scholars  of  parental 
education. 15,000 copies of the publication were printed and placed at  the Bank’s branches where customers and  the general 
public may access free of charge. A total of 75,000 copies have been printed to date since the first publication was made in 2013.2.

hosted 130 exhibitions since it was founded in 2000.②“Art Talk Lectures” held at Cathay United Art Center:The 2017 Art Talk Lectures focused on two main themes:  “abstract art” and “human culture and scenery.” They  provided the 
audience with opportunities to explore the “inner beauty” expressed through abstract art, and learn how to appreciate the “human 
culture and scenery” in realistic artworks and see the symbolism in paintings. Meanwhile, several artists are invited to support 
the themes of the exhibitions.③ Charity auction of specially designed calendar:In  2017,  the  Bank  designed  a  2018  calendar  with  the  theme  “Happiness  through Arts,”  which  featured  the  paintings  of  12 
renowned Taiwanese artists including Shou-Ying Wang, Fu-Rong Hsiao, Hsien-Fa Su, Yung-Fu Yang, Lung-Chi Lee, Mai-Hua 
Chi, Fan-Rong Yeh, Chang-Ta Chien, Chin-Lung Huang, Cheng-Lang Li, Rong Lin and Ruei-Ming Su. By presenting life, nature 
and beauty through the eyes of these artists, the art center hopes to bring colors into people’s lives throughout the year and help 
them rediscover happiness. Proceeds from the auction of albums, calendars and artworks were entirely donated to support the 
studies of disadvantage children.3. Sponsored events:① Dining and Sharing Campaign:Cathay United Bank makes regular donations through the Foundation to purchase breakfast meals for students in remote locations.

into the future” that incorporated a number of topics from human, arts, culture to investment, and offered young students a multitude 
of courses to learn useful knowledge. “Giving Winter Warmth” - an event that enabled children in remote areas to receive care from 
the society. “Cathay Scholarship” - a program that sponsors top-performing high school students from financially disadvantaged 
families, and rewards young talents for their special contribution, international honor, or devotion to culture, education, community 
management, environment, or financial technology development. “New Immigrant and Offspring Education” - a series of activities 
including: “Multi-cultural Learning,” “Tutor’s Workshop,” “International Conference for Experienced-based Cultural Education,” 
and “Eden Charity Auction” were organized under this program to raise public awareness and direct the public’s attention to the 
socially disadvantaged. The charity auction was held at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall, and proceeds from the auction were entirely 
donated  to  Eden  Social Welfare  Foundation,  where  they  were  used  to  care  for  new  immigrants  and  their  offspring.  The  diverse 
activities and services mentioned above are a good indication of the Bank’s commitment in charity and social responsibilities. In the 
future, the Foundation will continue to support charity events of all kinds so that love and warmth can be spread to all corners of the 
society.(II)  To support the government’s policies of helping social enterprises grow and obtain the required funding, the Bank collaborated with 
the  Taipei  City  Government  on  the  launch  of  “Social  Enterprise  Financing  Program”  and  worked  with  the  Small  and  Medium 
Enterprise Credit Guarantee Fund to provide guarantee on low-interest loans for borrowers that met the required eligibility criteria.94Scope of assessmentYesNoSummaryImplementation StatusDeviation(s) from Corporate 
Social Responsibility BestPractice Principles for 
TWSE/GTSM-ListedCompanies and Reason(s)By leveraging the strength of the government, organizations and enterprises, the Bank hoped to introduce a financing platform in 
favor  of  social  enterprises.  Since  the  program  started  in  April  2017,  the  Bank  has  lent  3  social  enterprises  for  a  sum  of  NT$14 
million, and supported their efforts toward caring for the socially disadvantaged and fostering a sustainable environment. The Bank 
pays constant attention to society’s needs and movements, and was the first in the industry to apply its expertise into introducing 
“Social Enterprise Financing Program”. This initiative was intended to provide liquidity for social enterprises in Taiwan and create 
a better commercial and social environment where they may thrive and realize their visions of an inclusive society.(III)  The  Bank’s  credit  cards  have  been  designed  with  the  function  to  store  electronic  invoices,  and  cardholders  are  constantly  being 
encouraged to receive statements and terms and conditions in electronic form as part of the Bank’s goal towards paperless process 
for the eco-friendly life. The Bank also organizes donation campaigns as a way to fulfill its social responsibilities. The following is 
a summary of main credit card campaigns organized in 2017:1. High  Speed  Rail  (HSR)  bonus  redemption:  When  purchasing  HSR  tickets  in  the  “Credit  Card  Promotions”  section  of  the  HSR 
official website or over counter, cardholders may choose to spend 5,600 reward points for an upgrade to Business Car, available in 
limited quantities. This privilege has been offered as an incentive for using public transport, and therefore reduce air pollution from 
motorcycles and cars. From 2014 until December 2017, cardholders spent a total of 5.92 million reward points on Taiwan High 
Speed Rail business car upgrades (equivalent to NT$2.56 million), representing approximately a 10% annual growth.2. Credit card online donation: Cardholders can make donations to 44 partnered charity organizations using credit card. The ability to 
make credit card donations online without leaving home serves as a great incentive for cardholders. In 2017, Cathay cardholders 
donated a total of NT$360 million to partnered charity organizations by credit cards.3. Reward point online donation: The Bank currently works with  6 charity organizations to accept online  donations in the form  of 
credit card reward points. From the website of each charity organization, cardholders may specify to donate NT$60 for every 1,000 
reward points held. Up to 100% of the current reward point balance can be redeemed to offset the amount of donation specified 
(donation amount over redemption of reward point can be paid by Cathay United Bank credit card). In 2017, cardholders made a95Scope of assessmentYesNoSummaryImplementation StatusDeviation(s) from Corporate

Foundation then submitted requests for refurbished computers from ASUS Foundation and donated them to remotely located schools 
or disadvantaged groups long-sponsored by Cathay United Bank Foundation. This process not only recycles and avoids wastage, 
but also helps reduce the digital divide of remotely located schools and the socially disadvantaged.(V)  Below is a summary of main health promotion events the Bank had organized in 2017:1. Cathay Financial Group organized a “Weight Loss Program” to promote healthy weight loss, proper exercise habits, and healthy

These advantages combined with theavailability of both physical and virtual channels has enabled the Bankto support customers with timely, suitable, and local services.② The  government  continues  to  relax  its  restrictions  on  the  creditactivities of local banks, and has kept an open mind towards Bank 3.0integration and new financial services that emerge from it. This levelof  active  support  helps  local  banks  develop  innovative  capacitytoward  financial  technologies,  which  opens  up  new  businessopportunities and new customer prospects for the banking industry.③ The Bank operates a network of 164 branches. This extensive branchcoverage  brings  the  Bank  close  to  local  customers  and  allows  it  toengage SME customers and related parties in total and timely financialinteractions that not only  enhance the depth and breadth of bankingrelationships, but increases revenues for the Bank as well.④ Spending from a growing base of credit card customers continues tocontribute  to  big  data,  which  helps  the  Bank  identify  customers’needs.⑤ The  Bank  is  the  largest  credit  card  issuer  in  Taiwan,  and  has  theadvantage to support merchants with full range of cash flow, productsand services with the support of group resources.⑥ Owing  to  the  government’s  ongoing  support  for  the  “Electronic158Payment  Popularity  Enhancement  Program,”  which  aims  to  raisepopularity  of  electronic  payment  to  52%  by  2020  and  popularity  ofmobile payment to 90% by 2025, convenience stores and many othermerchants  characterized  by  small,  high-frequency  purchases  havebegun accepting credit card as a payment tool. Over time, the programshould develop consumers’ credit card payment habit and strengthentheir attachment towards credit cards. In the future, we expect largemerchants to be the more capable ones supporting government policy,while small and medium merchants may also become more receptiveto  the  new  payment  option,  and  contribute  their  efforts  to  attractgeneral consumers into using new payment tools.⑦ With respect to automated channels, regulations are being amended toprovide  greater  flexibility.  Furthermore,  the  domestic  economyappears to be recovering steadily.⑧ Expansion  of  the  global  economy  continues.  The  world’s  majorresearch  institutions  are  generally  optimistic  about  the  futureeconomic  outlook;  withleadingindicators  pointing  upwards,economic recovery should continue into 2018 with the manufacturingsector  taking  charge.  Demand  for  capital  and  investor  confidenceshould  rise  among  the  corporate  world,  which  favors  banksparticularly  with  regards  to  their  lending  service.  The  Bank  willcapitalize on this trend by providing corporate customers with moreprofessional  and  diverse  services,  and  ultimately  improve  operatingperformance.  Threats① It is difficult for banks to enjoy excess profit margins due to saturationof  the  domestic  financial  market  and  the  prevailing  low-interestenvironment.  Furthermore,  given  the  rapid  changes  in  financialproducts  and  the  banking  environment,  banks  have  to  constantlyadjust  and  adapt,  which  presents  major  challenges  to  futureoperations.② Banks are facing challenges from new financial service providers asrecent deregulations no longer make banking an exclusively chartered159business.③ The  financial  industry  as  a  whole  is  struggling  to  improvecompetitiveness  due  to  slow  regulatory  adjustments,  a  saturatedfinancial  market,  and  the  low-interest  environment  they  operate  in.Furthermore, the types of service activities offered among peers are sohighly homogeneous that there is little margin to be generated fromconventional banking products. As a result, the local financial industryhas been unable to achieve any significant improvement in businessperformance, and has fallen substantially behind other banks in AsiaPacific in terms of growth and profitability.④ Credit cards are now being used solely as a payment tool, which makescommissions and fees the primary form of income. In an attempt toacquire new customers, banks are promising higher levels of productprivilege  and  incurring  high  marketing  costs  that  undermine  theindustry’s profit potentials.⑤ The Bank  made a late  entry into the transaction acquisition service,and due to intensive competition among  peers, this service segmenthas proven difficult to profit from.⑥ Competition of new payment tools should remain intense throughout2018. The most difficult challenge now is to stand out amidst the manybanking  and  non-banking  payment  tools  and  win  the  acceptance  ofconsumers and merchants.⑦ With  regards  to  automated  channels,  enhanced  information  securitymeasures have the potential to undermine system performance, and itmay  be  difficult  to  find  the  right  balance  between  convenience  andmoney laundering prevention.160  Response measures① Integrating  across  devices,  platforms  and  physical/virtual  channels,provide  digital  cashflowservice  and  enhance  accountcollection/payment  functions  to  become  the  customers’  primarybanker.② Leverage  existing  customers  for  service  referral,incorporategovernment resources for debt assurance, and grow relationship withhigh-potential  customers  through  local,  professional  and  efficientservices.③ Adopt  a  customer-centric  business  model  that  integrates  services,products and distribution to satisfy customers’ banking requirementsand deliver uniform service experience across channels.④ Enhance information-gathering capacity and analyze relevant data foridentification  of  potential  customers.  Combine  digital  banking  withbranch  services  to  deliver  sound  customer  experience  and  raisecustomers’ satisfaction.⑤ Form  strategic  alliance  with  business  partners  and  explore  newpayment  applications  in  line  with  mobile  payment  trends;  optimizecustomer  experience  and  developlifestyle-associated  bankingservices for brand differentiation.⑥ Enhance the banking relationships with high net worth customers andattract  young  customers.  Explore  customers’  potential  needs  andsatisfy them with suitable products and services. Create group synergyfrom cross-selling.⑦ In terms of transaction acquisition, the Bank will aim to make moreeffective  use  of  group  resources  and  expand  distribution  throughbranches and Cathay Life Insurance’s sales representatives. The Bankwill also explore hardware integration with business partners such asFamilyMart for cost reduction benefits.⑧ As  for  new  payment  services,  the  Bank  will  continue  searching  forsuitable  applications,  aim  to  cooperate  with  merchants  on  multiplelevels  through  group  affiliates,  and  create  a  complete  serviceecosystem by developing user habits among target customers.161⑨ With regards to automated channels, the Bank will actively anticipatefuture  deregulations  and  make  preparations  and  procedureoptimizations accordingly for improved customer experience.⑩ Given the rapid evolution of financial products, the financial industryremains  desperately  in  need  of  competent  talents,  which  is  why  theBank will continue implementing systematic training for talents localand abroad, and aim to build a workforce of adequate quality, quantityand professional characters to support corporate banking growth.(2)  Opportunities, threats, and response strategies in overseas markets  OpportunitiesThe  Bank’starget  markets  still  presents  significant  businessopportunities  given  their  strong  growth  potentials  and  favorableconditions.  ThreatsSupervisory  standards  have  tightened  around  the  world,  increasingoverall compliance cost.  Response measures① Enhance the robustness of compliance and risk management systemsand enforce accordingly.② Enhance risk  management and customer analysis for  more  effectivemanagement  of  risk;  grow  overseas  markets  with  an  innovative  yetconsistent strategy.(V)  Research and development of new financial instruments1.

to society,” the Bank has since been active in public welfare activities including 
offering of study aid, supporting charity sponsorship, holding cultural/arts events, 
and  consignment  charity.  The  Bank  is  highly  committed  in  fulfilling  corporate 
social responsibilities and organizes charity  events through Cathay United Bank

students  a  multitude  of  courses  to  learn  useful  knowledge.  “Giving  Winter 
Warmth” - an event that enabled children in remote areas to receive care from 
the society. “Cathay Scholarship” - a program that sponsors top-performing high 
school  students  from  financially  disadvantaged  families,  and  rewards  young 
talents for their special contribution, international honor, or devotion to culture, 
education,  community,  environment,  or  financial  technology  development.

Experienced-based  Cultural  Education,”  and  “Eden  Charity  Auction”  were 
organized under this program to raise public awareness and direct the public’s 
attention to the socially disadvantaged. The charity auction was held at Sun Yat-
Sen  Memorial  Hall,  and  proceeds  from  the  auction  were  entirely  donated  to 
Eden  Social  Welfare  Foundation,  where  they  were  used  to  care  for  new 
immigrants  and  their  offspring. The  diverse  activities  and  services  mentioned 
above  are  a  good  indication  of  the  Bank’s  commitment  in  charity  and  social

1.  [NPL ratio] increased: Loans to government agencies reduced significantly by NT$15.2 billion at the end of 2017 compared to 2016, which resulted in a NT$1.2-billiondecrease in total loan balance. Furthermore, hardship endured by certain industries resulted in deterioration of solvency, and affected asset quality to 
a certain degree.2.  [Profitability growth rate] increased: Due to higher interest revenues in 2017 compared to 2016.

3.  [Cash flow ratio], [cash flow adequacy ratio] and [cash flow coverage ratio] increased: Due to increased net cash flow from operating activities in 2017.(Note): Net cash flow from investing activities was negative, hence not calculated.* Companies that prepare standalone financial statements are also required to provide financial analysis on a standalone basis. 
* Companies that prepare IFRS-compliant financial information for less than 5 years are also required to complete Table (2) below and report financial information using financial accounting standards ofthe R.O.C.Note 1: Data from 2013 to 2016 have been audited and certified by the independent auditors. 
Note 2: Figures are unaudited, and were neither audited nor reviewed by CPAs. 
Note 3: Formulas of various analyses are defined below:1911. Operating ability(1) Deposit to loan ratio = total loan/ total deposit 
(2) NPL ratio = total non-performing loan / total loan 
(3) Interest Expense to Average Total Deposits = total interest expense on deposits / yearly average deposit balance 
(4) Interest Revenue to Average Total Loans = total interest revenue from credit / yearly average creditbalance 
(5) Total asset turnover = net income / average total assets 
(6) Average revenues per employee (Note 7) = net income / total employees 
(7) Average earnings per employee = net profit after tax/ total employees2. Profitability(1) Return on tier 1 capital =net profit before tax / average tier 1 capital. 
(2) ROA = net profit after tax / average total assets. 
(3) ROE = net profit after tax/ average shareholders’ equity. 
(4) Net profit margin =net profit after tax/net income 
(5) Earnings per share (EPS) = (attributable to shareholders’ equity of the parent – preferred stock dividends)/weighed average quantity of outstanding shares. (Note 5)3. Financial structure(1) Liabilities to assets ratio = total liabilities / total assets. 
(2) Ratio of property & equipment to shareholders' equity = net property & equipment / shareholders’ equity.4. Growth rate(1) Asset growth rate = (total assets in current period – total assets in previous period)/total assets in previous period 
(2) Profitability growth rate = (net profit before tax in current period – net profit before tax in previous period)/ net profit before tax in previous period5. Cash flows (Note 8)(1) Cash flow ratio = net cash flow from operating activities / (interbank borrowing and overdraft + commercial papers payable + financial liability at fair value through profit or loss + Notes and 
bonds issued under repurchase agreements + account payable within one year). 
(2) Cash flow adequacy = net cash flows from operating activities in the last 5 years/(capital expenditure + cash dividend) in the last 5 years 
(3) Cash flow coverage ratio = net cash flow from operating activities /net cash flow from investing activities6. Liquidity reserve ratio = liquid assets mandated by The Central Bank/ mandatory liquidity reserves. 
7. Scale of operation(1) Market share of assets = total assets/ total assets of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activities (Note 6) 
(2) Market share of net worth = net worth/ total net worth of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activities 
(3) Market share of deposits = total deposit/ total deposit of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activities 
(4) Market share of loans = total loan/ total loan of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activitiesNote 4: Total liabilities are net of provisions for guarantees and accidental losses. 
Note 5: Attention to the following is required when the aforementioned equations for the calculation of EPS are applied to assessment:1. The weighted average quantity of outstanding common shares shall be used as the standard, not the quantity of outstanding shares at the end of the year. 
2. In case of raising capital through issuing new shares or transactions of treasury stocks, calculate also the weighted average quantity of outstanding shares in the period of circulation. 
3. In case of capitalization of retained earnings or capitalization of capital surplus into new shares, adjustment shall be made in retrospect to the size of capitalization for each instance when calculatingthe earnings per shares annually or semi-annually. The time of issuance can be neglected.4. If the preferred shares are non-convertible accumulated preferred shares, the dividend declared in current period (whether paid or unpaid) shall be deducted from corporate earnings or as additionto earnings after taxation.5. If the preferred shares are not accumulative in nature, dividend for preferred shares shall be deducted from net profit after tax, if any. In case of loss, no adjustment shall be made.Note 6: Financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan-related activities include local banks, Taiwanese branches of Mainland banks, Taiwanese branches of foreign banks, credit cooperativeassociations, and credit departments of farmers/fishermen associations.Note 7: Revenue refers to the sum of interest and non-interest revenues. 
Note 8: The cash flow analysis takes into account the following:1. Net cash flow from operating activities is taken from the amount of net cash flow from operating activities presented in the cash flow statement. 
2. Capital expenditure refers to the amount of annual cash outflow for capital investments. 
3. Cash dividends include cash dividends to both common shares and preferred shares. 
4. Gross property, plant, and equipment refers to the amount before deducting accumulated depreciation192Analysis ItemYearCapitalCommon share equityTier 1 non-common share equityTier 2 capitalCapitalCredit RiskRisk weightedOperationassetsRiskMarketRiskStandardized approachInternal ratings based

(1) Capital = common share equity + Tier 1 non-common share equity + Tier 2 capital. 
(2) Total risk weighted assets = credit risk weighted assets + required capital for (operational risk + market risk) × 12.5. 
(3) Capital adequacy ratio = capital/ total risk weighted assets. 
(4) Tier 1 capital as a % of risk-weighted assets = (common share equity + other tier 1 capital that is not common share equity) / total risk-weighted assets. 
(5) Common share equity as a % of risk-weighted assets = common share equity / total risk-weighted assets. 
(6) Leverage ratio = net tier 1 capital / total risk exposure.

Operational risk management and the required capital.Operational risk refers to the risk of loss attributed to inappropriateor  failed  internal  process,  personnel  error,  system  malfunction,  orexternal  event.  It  includes  legal  risks  but  excludes  strategy  risks  andreputation risks.Operational risk management system2017DetailsThe  Bank  has  effective  operational  risk  management  framework 
and  systems  in  place  to  manage  banking  operations,  improve 
efficiency, reduce risk exposure, and secure assets. 
Apart  from  converting  operational  risk  strategies  into  feasible 
policies  and  procedures,  the  Bank  also  conducts  operational  risk 
self-assessment,  gathers  operational  risk  incidents,  and  uses  key 
risk indicators to help identify, assess, and monitor risks: 
(1)  “Operational  risk  self-assessment”:  Identify  risks  associated 
with operational activities as well as the underlying cause and 
control  methods;  devise  response  plans  based  on  risk 
exposure.(2)  “Operational  risk  incident  gathering”:  Initiate  reporting 
process  when  operational  risk  incident  occurs;  identify  and 
assess the underlying cause and discuss for improvement.(3)  “Key  risk  indicators”:  Develop  indicators  for  the  potential 
risks identified to facilitate evaluation of changes in exposure. 
The  board  of  directors  is  the  Bank’s  ultimate  decision-making 
authority  in  regards  to  operational  risk  management.  The  Risk 
Management  Division  has  specialized  units  established  to  help 
plan  and  implement  operational  risk  management  system,  assist 
departments in the establishment of standard operating procedures, 
and  consolidate/analyze/monitor  operational  risks  for  the  entire 
bank.  The  Risk  Management  Division  reports  to  the  board  of

and  low  level.  Response  measures  have  been  devised  for  the 
different levels of risk identified to enable effective monitoring and 
improve  operational  risk  exposure.  The  operational  risk  event

uses insurance and engages external parties to mitigate or transfer 
potential exposures. The Bank has business continuity policies and 
rules  in  place  to  address  risk  events  that  are  likely  to  cause 
disruption to business operations. Drills are conducted from time

Liquidity risk management factors include:(a)  Deposit to loan ratio (%):1.  The Bank strictly controls the relative weight of its deposits and loans 
out  of  liquidity  concerns. A  high  loan-to-deposit  ratio  presents  high 
liquidity risk to the Bank.2.  The Bank aims to maintain its loan-to-deposit ratio below 90%.(b)  Deposit diversity measures:The Bank constantly assesses the percentage of deposits held by large 
customers to avoid concentration. By diversifying the source of deposit, the 
Bank  is  able  to  prevent  major  liquidity  gaps  due  to  withdrawal  by  large-
sum deposit holders.2141.2.3.Balance of top 10 NTD deposit holdersTotal NTD deposit balanceBalance of top-10 foreign currency depositholdersTotal foreign currency deposit balanceBalance of top-10 deposit holdersTotal deposit balance> 20%> 40%> 20%4.

The  Bank  also  has  rules  in  place  to  regulatesecurity  investments  in  a  way  that  achieves  diversification  and  avoidsconcentration.(d)  Diversification of capital source:The Bank’s funding channels include (but are not limited to) the following:1.  Loans from peer banks:The Bank borrows from peers in the money market to meet its cashoutlays. Total interbank borrowing is capped at 200% of the Bank’s networth. If the following conditions are met simultaneously, the TreasuryDepartment will escalate to Asset and Liability Management Committeefor proper management of the situation.Balance of NTD interbank borrowing from top 10 peersSum of NTD loans + NTD security investments> 10%2.  Issuance of negotiable certificates of deposit (NCD):The sum of NCDs issued to financial industry is capped at 20% of theBank’s total NTD deposit balance.B. The following reports are prepared as means to monitor and manage liquidity risk:(a)  The  Treasury  Operations  Department  prepares  a  Liquidity  ReserveAdjustment Report and submits it to the authority on a daily basis. Liquidityreserve ratio is calculated by dividing actual liquidity reserve with requiredliquidity reserve. The ratio is controlled using the following standards:215Risk gradeGrade 1  Grade 2  Grade 3  Grade 4  Grade 5Risk levelLow riskMedium-MediumMedium-low riskriskhigh riskHigh riskLiquidityreserve ratio≧27%  ≧22%  ≧17%  ≧12%  ＜12%(b)  The  Finance  and  Accounting  Department  is  required  to  prepare  “NTDMaturity Analysis Report” on a monthly basis to calculate the percentage ofnegative  gaps  (excluding  committed  credit  lines)  accumulated  in  eachmaturity interval relative to the Bank’s current net worth, then determine thegrade and level of risk of the current situation. The department aims to avoidsituations  where:  negative  liquidity  gap  within  the  0-90  days  intervalaccumulates  to  20%  of  total  current  liabilities,  or  negative  liquidity  gapwithin the 0-30 days interval falls below -3% of total NTD assets.

Any  irregularities  noticed  on  the  reports  are  escalated  to  theTreasury  Department,  and  escalated  by  the  Finance  and  AccountingDepartment during Asset and Liability Management Committee meetings toadjust the Bank’s asset and liability structure.(d)  A  “Foreign  Currency  Liquidity  Gap Analysis”  is  prepared  if  any  foreigncurrency accounts for more than 5% of total liability. If mismatch of foreigncurrency asset and liability amounts to a negative gap higher than 40% oftotal  foreign  currency  assets  in  any  maturity  interval,  the  Finance  andAccounting Department will have to notify the Market Risk Management216Department  call  an  extraordinary  Asset  and  Liability  ManagementCommittee  meeting  to  discuss  the  Bank’s  foreign  currency  asset  andliability structure and pricing principles.(e)  The Bank calculates liquidity coverage ratios on a monthly basis. If liquiditycoverage ratio falls below 150% of the level stipulated by the authority, abriefing is made during Asset and Liability  Risk Management Committeemeeting and a notice will be issued to the Treasury Department to adjust theBank’s asset and liability structure.(f)The Bank is required to comply with deposit reserve and minimum liquidityrequirements stipulated by the authority in “The Requirement for MinimumRatio  of  Current Assets  to  Liabilities  Ratio  of  Financial  Institutions”  and“Directions for Auditing Liquidity of Financial Institutions.”(II)Impact  on  the  Bank’s  financial  standing  and  business  operations  due  tochanges  in  domestic  or  foreign  policies  and  laws,  and  correspondingcountermeasures to such changes:In  light  of  tightening  compliance  and AML/CTF  requirements  around  theworld,  the  Bank  has  not  only  implemented  controls  in  the  form  of  system,software and hardware, but also completed training for compliance officers,AML officers and CTF officers of various departments, and thereby compliedwith the latest regulatory amendments (2017). Employees are also trained onrelevant topics so that they offer the Bank’s financial services with consumerprotection  and  risk  control  in  mind.  The  Bank  anticipates  amendment  andimplementation of the Labor Standards Act and makes adequate preparationsto  ensure  effective  allocation  of  manpower.  The  work  hour  managementsystem is constantly reviewed for conformity with operational requirements.(III)  Impact  on  the  Bank’s  financial  standing  due  to  technological  or  industrialchanges, and corresponding countermeasures:1. Digital  banking  opens  up  innovations  while  payment  service  reducespeople’s dependency on cash. Together, they create a cashless environmentand  give  rise  to  new  payment  channels  that  not  only  change  customers’shopping  needs  and  behaviors,  but  also  enable  gathering  of  transactioninformation for the creation of a banking environment that conforms withpeople’s  needs.  This  integration  between  payment  service  and  mobiledevice allows merchants to develop new ways to interact with customersand presents banks with new profit models.2. Innovation of financial service models will only accelerate as technologies217progress, which is why the Bank has been focusing on the development ofcustomer-oriented, “full-channel” digital banking services in recent years.Apart from making improvements to the existing digital platform, severalapplication  services  have  also  been  introduced  online  to  promote  digitalinteraction, create value and satisfy customers’ needs. The success of whichhas  presented  the  Bank  with  a  new  profit  model.  Technologicaladvancement, Fintech and innovation not only bring more diverse range offinancial service to customers, but also help young people manage financewith ease.3.

The Bank continues to collaborate with internationalas well as local partners on the creation of convenient and lifestyle-drivendigital  banking  experience  from  payment  to  account  management  byincorporating  mobile  services.  The  use  of  digital  solutions  also  enablesgathering  of  useful  information  that  further  improves  managementperformance.4. In  response  to  ongoing  development  of  financial  innovation  policies  andFintech,  the  Bank  has  taken  the  initiative  to  deliver  unique  experiencethrough  creation  of  an  innovative  digital  platform,  and  use  it  as  a  mainchannel for serving customers of the digital age.5.

Sum  ofprivate placement is approved at NT$14,998,000,080. 
This private placement of common shares was priced in 
reference to the price-to-book ratio of Cathay FHC (the 
parent  company)  after  taking  into  consideration  the 
potential  benefits  and  profitability  of  the  Bank,  at  no 
lower than the Bank’s net worth per share and no lower 
than 80% of the reference price. Pricing method for the 
private  common  share  placement,  as  described  above, 
has been reviewed by CPAs, for which they have issued 
a letter of opinion to support the underlying rationality. 
Given the Bank’s status as a 100%-owned subsidiary of 
Cathay  FHC,  this  private  placement  was  entirely 
subscribed by a single corporate shareholder.The  Bank  is  a  public  company  organized  by  a  single 
corporate shareholder. The cash issue did not proceed in 
the form of public offering due to the Bank’s intention 
to  maintain  the  simplicity  of  its  shareholder  structure. 
Sum  of  this  private  cash  issue  was  capped  below  the 
sum  of  new  capital  that  Cathay  FHC  (the  parent 
company) had received from its recent cash issue, and 
is  expected  to  provide  the  Bank  with  the  additional 
working  capital  needed  to  increase  capital  adequacy 
ratio, enhance risk tolerance and support future business 
growth local and abroad.231Item2017 first private placement (Note 1)Issuing date: June 13, 2017Payment completionJune 13, 2017dateSubscriber ofCathay Financial Holding Co., Ltd.Subscriber’sbackgroundprivateplacement(Note 5)Eligibility(Note 6)Subparagraph 1, Paragraph 1, Article43-6 of the Securities and ExchangeAct.

BusinessCathay United Bank (“the Bank”), originally named United World Chinese Commercial 
Bank  (“UWCCB”),  was  enfranchised  by  the  government  of  the  Republic  of  China 
(“ROC”)  in  January  1975.    The  Bank  started  its  operations  on  20  May  1975  and  is 
engaged in the following operations: (1) all commercial banking operations authorized 
by  the  ROC  Banking  Act  (“Banking  Act”);  (2)  international  banking  business  and 
related  operations;  (3)  trust  business;  (4)  off-shore  banking  business;  and  (5)  other 
financial operations related to the promotion of investments by overseas Chinese.    The 
Bank’s registered office and the main business location is at No.7, Songren Rd., Xinyi 
District, Taipei City, Republic of China (R.O.C.). 
 
The  Bank’s  stock  was  traded  on  the Taiwan  Stock  Exchange  (the  “TWSE”)  until  18 
December 2002. On 18 December 2002, the Bank became a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of  Cathay  Financial  Holding  Co.,  Ltd.  (“Cathay  Financial  Holdings”)  through  a 
conversion  transaction  and  delisted  from  TWSE.  Under  the  Financial  Institutions 
Merger Act,  the  Bank  engaged  in  a  merger  with  the  former  Cathay  United  Bank,  a 
wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Cathay  Financial  Holdings.  The  record  date  for  such 
merger was 27 October 2003 and UWCCB survived and was renamed Cathay United 
Bank. 
 
The Bank merged with Lucky Bank on 1 January 2007. The Bank was the surviving 
entity after this merger and Lucky Bank was the extinguished entity. In addition, the 
Bank  acquired  specific  assets,  liabilities,  and  business  of  China  United  Trust  & 
Investment Corporation (“CUTIC”) on 29 December 2007. 
 
Cathay Financial Holding Co., Ltd. is the Bank’s parent company and ultimate parent 
company.2.  Date and procedures of authorization of financial statements for issueThe consolidated financial statements of the Bank and subsidiaries (“the Group”) were 
authorized for issue in accordance with the Board of Directors’ resolution on 15 March 
2018.3.  Newly issued or revised standards and interpretations(1)  Changes  in  accounting  policies  resulting  from  applying  for  the  first  time certainstandards and amendments:The Group applied for the first time International Financial Reporting Standards, 
International Accounting Standards, and Interpretations issued, revised or amended 
which  are  endorsed  by  Financial  Supervisory  Commission  (“FSC”)  and  become 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. The nature and 
the impact of each new standard and amendment that has a material effect on the 
Group is described below:271IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” (Amendment) 
 
This amendments relate to the amendment issued in May 2011 and require entities 
to  disclose  the  recoverable  amount  of  an  asset  (including  goodwill)  or  a  cash-
generating unit when an impairment loss has been recognized or reversed during 
the period. The amendments also require detailed disclosure of how the fair value 
less  costs  of  disposal  has  been  measured  when  an  impairment  loss  has  been 
recognized  or  reversed,  including  valuation  techniques  used,  level  of  fair  value 
hierarchy  of  assets  and  key  assumptions  used  in  measurement.  The  Group 
evaluated that the amendment only affected the related disclosure.(2)  Standards  or  interpretations  issued,  revised  or  amended,  which  are  endorsed  by 
FSC, but  not  yet  adopted by the Group as at  the end of the reporting period  are 
listed below:A. IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”The core principle of the new Standard is for companies to recognize revenue 
to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in amounts 
that  reflect  the  consideration  to  which  the  Bank  expects  to  be  entitled  in 
exchange  for  those  goods  or  services.  An  entity  recognizes  revenue  in 
accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps: 
 
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer 
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract 
Step 3: Determine the transaction price 
Step  4: Allocate  the  transaction  price  to  the  performance  obligations  in  the 
contract 
Step  5:  Recognize  revenue  when  (or  as)  the  entity  satisfies  a  performance 
obligationThe  new  Standard  includes  a  cohesive  set  of  disclosure  requirements  that 
would  result  in  an  entity  providing  users  of  financial  statements  with 
comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty 
of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity's contracts with customers. 
The Standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2018.B. IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”The IASB has issued the final version of IFRS 9, which combines classification 
and  measurement,  the  expected  credit  loss  impairment  model  and  hedge 
accounting.  The  standard  will  replace  IAS  39  Financial  Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments 
issued  on  classification  and 
measurement of financial assets and liabilities and hedge accounting).include  standards(which272Classification  and  measurement:  Financial  assets  are  measured  at  amortized 
cost,  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  or  fair  value  through  other 
comprehensive  income,  based  on  both  the  entity’s  business  model  for 
managing the financial assets and the financial assets’ contractual cash flow 
characteristics. Financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost or fair value 
through profit or loss. Furthermore there is requirement that “own credit risk” 
adjustments are not recognized in profit or loss. 
 
Impairment:  Expected  credit  loss  model  is  used  to  evaluate  impairment. 
Entities are required to recognize either 12-month or lifetime expected credit 
losses, depending on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk 
since initial recognition. 
 
Hedge  accounting:  Hedge  accounting  is  more  closely  aligned  with  risk 
management activities and hedge effectiveness is measured based on the hedge 
ratio. 
 
The  new  standard  is  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1 
January  2018.    Consequential  amendments  on  the  related  disclosures  also 
become effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.C. IFRS  10  “Consolidated  Financial  Statements”  and  IAS  28”  Investments  in 
Associates  and  Joint  Ventures”  –  Sale  or  Contribution  of Assets  between  an 
Investor and its Associate or Joint VenturesThe amendments address the inconsistency between the requirements in IFRS 
10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates 
and Joint Ventures, in dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is 
contributed to an associate or a joint venture. IAS 28 restricts gains and losses 
arising  from  contributions  of  non-monetary  assets  to  an  associate  or  a  joint 
venture to the extent of the interest attributable to the other equity holders in 
the associate or joint ventures. IFRS 10 requires full profit or loss recognition 
on the loss of control of the subsidiary. IAS 28 was amended so that the gains 
or  losses  resulting  from  the  sale  or  contribution  of  assets  that  constitute  a 
business  as defined in  IFRS 3 between an investor and its associate or joint 
venture is recognized in full.   
 
IFRS 10 was also amended so that the gains or losses resulting from the sale 
or contribution of a subsidiary that does not constitute a business as defined in 
IFRS 3 between an investor and its associate or joint venture is recognized only 
to  the  extent  of  the  unrelated  investors’  interests  in  the  associate  or  joint 
venture.     
 
The  effective  date  of  the  amendments  has  been  postponed  indefinitely,  but 
early adoption is allowed.273D. IAS  12 “Income Taxes” – Recognition  of Deferred Tax Assets  for  UnrealizedLossesThe amendments clarify how to account for deferred tax assets for unrealized 
losses. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2017.E. Disclosure Initiative – Amendment to IAS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows”The amendments relate to changes in liabilities arising from financing activities 
and  to  require  a  reconciliation  of  the  carrying  amount  of  liabilities  at  the 
beginning  and  end  of  the  period.  The  amendments  are  effective  for  annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.F.  IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” – Clarifications to IFRS 15The amendments clarify how to identify a performance obligation in a contract, 
determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent, and determine whether 
the revenue from granting a licence should be recognized at a point in time or 
over  time. The  amendments  are  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or 
after 1 January 2018.G. IFRS 2 “Shared-Based Payment” – Amendments to IFRS 2The amendments contain a. clarifying that vesting conditions other than market 
condition, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value of the cash-
setteled share-based payment at the measurement date. Instead, these are taken 
into account by adjusting the number of awards included in the measurement of 
the liability arising from the trasaction, b. clarifying if tax laws or regulations 
oblige  the  employer  to  withhold  a  certain  amount  for  an  employee’s  tax 
obligation  to  the  tax  authority  on  the  employee’s  behalf  in  order  to  meet  the 
employee’s  tax  obligation  associated  with  the  share-based  payment,  such 
transactions  will  be  classified  in  their  entirety  as  equity-settled  share-based 
payment transactions if they would have been so classified in the absence of the 
net share settlement feature, and c. clarifying that if the terms and conditions of 
a cash-settled share-based payment transaction are modified, with the result that 
it becomes an equity-settled share-based payment transaction, the transaction is 
accounted for as an equity-settled transaction from the date of the modification. 
The equity-settled share-based payment transaction is measured by reference to 
the fair value of the equity instruments granted at the modification date and is 
recognized in equity, on the modification date, to the extent to which goods or 
services  have  been  received.  The  liability  for  the  cash-settled  share-based 
payment  transaction  as  at  the  modification  date  is  derecognized  on  that  date. 
Any difference between the carrying amount of the liability derecognized and 
the  amount  recognized  in  equity  on  the  modification  date  is  recognized 
immediately in profit or loss. The amendments are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018.274H. Applying IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” with IFRS 4 “Insurance Contracts”– Amendments to IFRS 4The amendments help to resolve issues arising from the different effective dates 
for  IFRS  9  “Financial  Instruments”  (1  January  2018)  and  the  new  insurance 
contracts standard about to be issued by the IASB (not before 1 January 2021). 
The amendments allow entities issuing insurance contracts within the scope of 
IFRS 4 to mitigate certain effects of applying IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” 
before  the  IASB’s  new  insurance  contracts  standard  becomes  effective.  The 
amendments introduce two approaches: an overlay approach and a temporary 
exemption. The overlay approach allows an entity applying IFRS 9 to remove 
from profit or loss the effects of some of the accounting mismatches that may 
occur  from  applying  IFRS  9  before  the  new  insurance  contracts  standard  is 
applied.  The  temporary  exemption  enables  eligible  entities  to  defer  the 
implementation  date  of  IFRS  9  until  the  effective  date  of  new  insurance 
contracts  standard  (these  entities  that  defer  the  application  of  IFRS  9  will 
continue to apply IAS 39).I.  Transfers of Investment Property – Amendments to IAS 40The amendments relate to the transfers of investment property. The amendments 
clarify that a change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet, 
the definition of investment property and there is evidence of the change in use, 
the  entity  should  transfer  property  into  and  out  of  investment  property 
accordingly. A mere change in management’s intentions for the use of a property 
does not provide evidence of a change in use. The amendments are effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.J.  Improvements  to  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (2014–2016cycle)IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” 
 
The amendments revise and amend transition requirements relating to  certain 
standards  and  delete  short-term  exemptions  under Appendix  E  for  first-time 
adopter. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018. 
 
IFRS 12 “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities” 
 
The amendments clarify that the disclosure requirements in IFRS 12, other than 
those in paragraphs B10–B16, apply to an entity’s interests that are classified as 
held  for  sale  or  discontinued  operations.  The  amendments  are  effective  for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.275IAS 28 “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures” 
 
The  amendments  clarify  that  when  an  investment  in  an  associate  or  a  joint 
venture is held by, or is held indirectly through, an entity that is a venture capital 
organisation, or a mutual fund, unit trust and other qualifying entities including 
investment-linked  insurance  funds,  the  entity  may  elect  to  measure  that 
investment  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  in  accordance  with  IFRS  9 
“Financial  Instruments”  on  an  investment-by-investment  basis.  Besides,  if  an 
entity that is not itself an investment entity has an interest in an associate or joint 
venture that is an investment entity, the entity may, when applying the equity 
method, elect to retain the fair value measurement applied by that investment 
entity  associate  or  joint  venture  to  the  investment  entity  associate's  or  joint 
venture's  interests  in  subsidiaries  on  an  investment-by-investment  basis.  The 
amendments  are  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1  January 
2018.K. IFRIC 22 “Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration”The interpretation clarifies that when applying paragraphs 21 and 22 of IAS 21 
“The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”, in determining the spot 
exchange  rate  to  use  on  initial  recognition  of  the  related  asset,  expense  or 
income (or part of it), the date of the transaction is the date on which an entity 
initially  recognizes  the  non-monetary  asset  or  non-monetary  liability  arising 
from  the  advance  consideration.  If  there  are  multiple  payments  or  receipts  in 
advance,  then  the  entity  must  determine  a  date  of  the  transactions  for  each 
payment or receipt of advance consideration. The interpretation is effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.The abovementioned standards and interpretations issued by IASB and endorsed 
by  FSC  so  that  they  are  applicable  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1 
January 2018. Apart from the potential impact of the standards and interpretations 
listed  under  (A)  and  (B),  which  is  described  below,  all  other  standards  and 
interpretations have no material impact on the Group: 
 
A. The explanation related to the application of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers (including Amendments to IFRS 15 Clarifications to IFRS 15 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers) is as follows:In  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  IFRS  15,  more  extensive  disclosure 
would have to be made.B. The explanation related to the application of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is asfollows:The  Group  elected  not  to  restate  prior  periods  in  accordance  with  the 
requirements of IFRS 9 at the date of initial application (1 January 2018).276a.  Classification and measurement of financial assetsFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss 
 
Financial  instruments  which  are  classified  as  held-for-trading  derivative 
instruments in financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss 
and  mixed  instruments  designated  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  in 
accordance with IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss under IFRS 9. 
 
Available-for sale financial assets 
 
Classified  as  available-for-sale  financial  assets  according  to  IAS  39, 
including beneficiary certificates, stocks and bonds. The related explanation 
of change in classification is as follows: 
 
(a)  Beneficiary certificatesAs the cash flow characteristics for beneficiary certificates are not solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, 
beneficiary certificates are classified as financial assets measured at fair 
value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9. As at the date of 
initial application, the Group will reclassify available-for-sale financial 
assets to financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.(b)  StocksUpon  de-recognition  of  equity  investments  currently  classified  as 
available-for-sale measured at fair value, the accumulated gains or losses 
previously recognized in other comprehensive income was recycled to 
profit  or  loss  from  equity.    However,  under  IFRS  9,  subsequent  fair 
value changes of the aforementioned equity investments are recognized 
in other comprehensive income and cannot be recycled to profit or loss. 
Upon de-recognition,  the accumulated amounts in other  component of 
equity is reclassified to retained earnings (reclassification to profit or loss 
is not allowed). 
 
Based on the facts and circumstances that existed as on 1 January 2018, 
aside  from  part  of  the  financial  assets  which  are  not  held-for-trading 
investments  designated  to  measure  at  fair  value  through  other 
comprehensive  income,  the  others  should  be  reclassified  as  financial 
assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. No difference from 
carrying amount exists when stocks are mearsured at fair value.277(c)  BondsAs  the  cash  flow  characteristics  for  bonds  are  solely  payments  of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, based on the 
facts and circumstances that existed as on 1 January 2018, bonds should 
be reclassified from available-for-sale financial assets to financial assets 
measured at amortized cost in accordance with  IFRS 9 if the financial 
assets  are  held  within  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  to  hold 
financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows. The difference 
between  fair  value  and  amortized  cost  previously  recognized  will  be 
adjusted  to  other  equity  and  the  carrying  amount  of  the  reclassified 
financial  assets.  The  financial  assets  should  also  be  assessed  for 
impairment in accordance with IFRS 9. 
 
Bond  investments  held  within  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  to 
hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows should be 
classified  as  financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  other 
comprehensive  income  under  IFRS  9.  No  difference  from  carrying 
amount  exists,  and  the  aforementioned  assets  should  be  assessed  for 
impairment in accordance with IFRS 9.   
 
Bond  investments  whose  cash  flow  characteristics  for  beneficiary 
certificates  are  not  solely  payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  the 
principal  amount  outstanding  should  be  classified  as  financial  assets 
measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  under  IFRS  9.  The 
reclassification doesn’t result in any difference from carrying amount.Held-to maturity financial assets and debt instrument investments for which 
no active market exists 
 
Bond  investments  classified  as  held-to-maturity  financial  assets  and  loans 
and receivables (placed in debt instrument investments for which no active 
market exists) according to IAS 39 and whose cash flow characteristics are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, 
based  on  the  facts  and  circumstances  that  existed  as  at  the  date  of  initial 
application, should be reclassified from held-to maturity financial assets and 
debt  instrument  investments  for  which  no  active  market  exists  to  financial 
assets measured at amortized cost in accordance with IFRS 9 if the financial 
assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial 
assets in order to collect contractual cash flows. No difference from carrying 
amount  exists,  and  the  aforementioned  assets  should  be  assessed  for 
impairment in accordance with IFRS 9.278Held-to maturity financial assets and debt instrument investments for which 
no active market exists held within a business model whose objective is to 
hold  financial  assets  in  order  to  collect  contractual  cash  flows  should  be 
reclassified  as  financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  other 
comprehensive income under IFRS 9. The reclassification of business model 
will increase other equity and the carrying amount of the reclassified financial 
assets. The aforementioned assets should also be assessed for impairment in 
accordance with IFRS 9. 
 
Bond  investments  classified  as  loans  and  receivables  (placed  in  debt 
instrument investments for which no active market exists) according to IAS 
39 and whose cash flow characteristics are solely payments of principal and 
interest on the principal amount outstanding should be classified as financial 
assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.b.  Impairment assessment of financial assetsAs for financial assets (e.g. on-balance sheet debt instruments and off-balance 
sheet debt instruments) that are not measured at fair value through profit or 
loss, the impairment of debt instruments is evaluated by applying expected 
credit risk model in accordance with IFRS 9. If the credit risk of the financial 
assets  doesn’t  increase  significantly  after  the  initial  recognition,  the 
allowance for losses will be measured at 12-month expected credit losses. If 
the credit risk of the financial assets increases significantly after the initial 
recognition  and  is  not  low  credit  risk,  the  allowance  for  losses  will  be 
measured at credit losses during remaining term to maturity. For receivables 
and contractual assets arose from the transactions in the scope of IFRS 15, 
credit losses are evaluated by simplified method. The aforementioned rule of 
impairment  assessment  is  different  from  incurred  losses  model  applied 
currently.c.  Effects on the date of initial applicationIn  accordance  with  classification  and  measurement  of  financial  assets  and 
impairment  assessment in  IFRS 9, the Group expects  to  increase assets  by 
$3,635,423  thousand,  increase  liabilities  by  $436,481  thousand,  decrease 
retained  earnings  by  $492,615  thousand  and  increase  other  equity  by 
$3,691,557 thousand on the date of initial application (1 January 2018). 
 
(a)  Classification and measurement of financial assetsParts  of  held-to-maturity  financial  assets  and  Investments  in  debt 
securities  with  no  active  market  are  reclassified  to  financial  assets 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and parts of 
available-for-sale  financial  assets  are  reclassified  to  financial  assets 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, thus reflect 
the impact from adjustments of unrealized gains. The assets increased by 
$3,496,801  thousand,  the  liabilities  increased  by  $314,205  thousand, 
retained  earnings  decreased  by  $484,779  thousand  and  other  equity 
increased by $3,667,375 thousand.279(b)  Impairment assessment of financial assetsThe  Group  recognized  adjustments  of  expected  credit  losses  of  on-
balance  sheet  and  off-balance  sheet  debt  instruments,  which  increased 
assets by $138,622 thousand, increased liabilities by $122,276 thousand, 
decreased  retained  earnings  by  $7,836  thousand  and  increased  other 
equity by $24,182 thousand.d.  OthersConsequential  amendments  on  the  related  disclosures  in  IFRS  7  were  also 
made as a result of the application of IFRS 9, which include the disclosure 
requirements  related  to  the  initial  application  of  IFRS  9.  Therefore  more 
extensive disclosure would have to be made.(3)  Standards  or  interpretations  issued,  revised  or  amended,  by  IASB  but  not  yet 
endorsed by  FSC at  the  date of issuance of the  Group’s financial statements are 
listed below:A. IFRS 16 “Leases”The new standard requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-
balance sheet model (subject to certain exemptions). Lessor accounting still uses 
the dual classification approach: operating lease and finance lease. The Standard 
is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.B. IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments”The  Interpretation  clarifies  application  of  recognition  and  measurement 
requirements in IAS 12 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax 
treatments. The  Interpretation  is  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or 
after 1 January 2019.C. IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts”On initial recognition, an entity shall measure a group of insurance contracts at 
the  total  of  the  fulfilment  cash  flows  and  the  contractual  service  margin. The 
fulfilment cash flows comprise of the following:   
 
a.  estimates of future cash flows 
b.  discount  rate:  an  adjustment  to  reflect  the  time  value  of  money  and  the 
financial risks related to the future cash flows, to the extent that the financial 
risks are not included in the estimates of the future cash flowsc.  a risk adjustment for non-financial risk280In addition to general model, the Standard required investment contracts with 
discretionary  participation  features  to  apply  variable  fee  approach  (VFA),  a 
modification of general model. If certain criteria are met, an entity may apply 
the premium allocation approach (PAA), a simplified measurement approach, to 
measure the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage.IFRS 17 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021.D. IAS 28 “Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures” – Amendments to IAS 28The amendments clarify that an entity applies IFRS 9 to long-term interests in 
an associate or joint venture that form part of the net investment in the associate 
or joint venture before it applies IAS 28, and in applying IFRS 9, does not take 
account of any adjustments that arise from applying IAS 28. The amendment is 
effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.E. Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (Amendments to IFRS 9)The amendment allows financial assets with prepayment features that permit or 
require a party to a contract either to pay or receive reasonable compensation for 
the early termination of the contract, to be measured at amortized cost or at fair 
value  through  other  comprehensive  income.  The  amendment  is  effective  for 
annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.F.  Improvements  to  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (2015-2017cycle)IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” 
 
The amendments clarify that an entity that has joint control of a joint operation 
shall remeasure its previously held interest in a joint operation when it obtains 
control  of  the  business.  The  amendments  are  effective  for  annual  periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2019.IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements” 
 
The amendments clarify that an entity that participates in, but does not have joint 
control of, a joint operation does not remeasure its previously held interest in a 
joint operation when it obtains joint control of the business. The amendments 
are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.281IAS 12 “Income Taxes” 
 
The  amendments  clarify  that  an  entity  shall  recognize  the  income  tax 
consequences  of  dividends  in  profit  or  loss,  other  comprehensive  income  or 
equity  according  to  where  the  entity  originally  recognized  those  past 
transactions  or  events.  The  amendments  are  effective  for  annual  periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2019. 
 
IAS 23 “Borrowing Costs” 
 
The amendments clarify that an entity should treats as part of general borrowings 
any borrowing made specifically to obtain an asset when the asset is ready for 
its  intended  use  or  sale.  The  amendments  are  effective  for  annual  periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2019.G. Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement – Amendments to IAS 19The amendments clarify that when a change in a defined benefit plan is made 
(such as amendment, curtailment or settlement, etc.), the entity should use the 
updated assumptions to remeasure its net defined benefit liability or asset. The 
amendments  are  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1  January 
2019.The abovementioned standards and interpretations issued by  IASB have  not 
yet  endorsed by  FSC at  the date when the  Bank’s financial statements were 
authorized for issue, the local effective dates are to be determined by FSC. The 
Group  is  currently  determining  the  potential  impact  of  the  standards  and 
interpretations.4.  Summary of significant accounting policies(1)  Statement of complianceThe  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group  for  the  years  ended  31 
December 2017 and 2016 have been prepared in accordance with the “Regulations 
Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Public Banks”, the “Regulations 
Governing  the  Preparation  of  Financial  Reports  by  Securities  Issuers”,  the 
“Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Firms” 
and  “International  Financial  Reporting  Standards”,  “International  Accounting 
Standards”,  “Interpretations  developed  by  the  International  Financial  Reporting 
Interpretations  Committee  or  the  former  Standing  Interpretations  Committee”  as 
endorsed by Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic of China.282(2)  Basis of preparationThe  consolidated  financial  reports  comprise  the  consolidated  balance  sheet, 
consolidated statements of comprehensive income, the consolidated statements of 
change in equity, the consolidated statements of cash flows and related notes.   
 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, 
except for financial instruments and investment property that have been measured 
at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are expressed in thousands of 
New Taiwan Dollars unless otherwise stated. 
 
The Group classifies their economic activities as operating, investing and financing 
activities in accordance with management’s judgment. The consolidated statements 
of  cash  flows  presented  the  changes  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents  during  the 
reporting  period  from  operating, 
investing  and  financing  activities.  The 
components of cash and cash equivalents are disclosed in Note 6.(1).(3)  Basis of consolidationPreparation principle of consolidated financial statement 
 
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to  affect those returns 
through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if 
and only if the Group has: 
 
A. power  over  the  investee  (i.e.  existing  rights  that  give  it  the  current  ability  todirect the relevant activities of the investee)B. exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee,andC. the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns 
 
When the Bank has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, 
the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has 
power over an investee, including: 
 
A. the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee 
B. rights arising from other contractual arrangements 
C. the Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights283The  Bank  re-assesses  whether  or  not  it  controls  an  investee  if  facts  and 
circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements 
of control. 
 
Subsidiaries  are  fully  consolidated  from  the  acquisition  date,  being  the  date  on 
which the Bank obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that 
such control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for 
the  same  reporting  period  as  the  parent  company,  using  uniform  accounting 
policies.  All  intra-group  balances,  income  and  expenses,  unrealized  gains  and 
losses and dividends resulting from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full. 
 
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a change of control, is 
accounted for as an equity transaction. 
 
Total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the 
parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling 
interests having a deficit balance.   
 
If the Bank loses control of a subsidiary, it: 
 
A. Derecognizes the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary; 
B. Derecognizes the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest; 
C. Recognizes the fair value of the consideration received; 
D. Recognizes the fair value of any investment retained; 
E. Recognizes any surplus or deficit in profit or loss; and 
F.  Reclassifies  the  parent’s  share  of  components  previously  recognized  in  othercomprehensive income to profit or loss.The consolidated entities are listed as follows:InvestorSubsidiaryBusinessOwnership (%)nature2017.12.31  2016.12.31The Bank    Indovina Bank Limited (“Indovina Bank”) Indovina Bank wasWholesale50%50%incorporated in Vietnam on 21 November 1990.bankingThe Bank    Cathay  United  Bank  (Cambodia)  Corporation  LimitedWholesale100%100%(”CUBC Bank”)bankingSBC Bank was incorporated in Cambodia on 5 July 1993, andrenamed as CUBC as of 14 January 2014.284For the  years  ended 31  December 2017 and 2016, respectively, the consolidated 
financial statements excluded the following subsidiaries because their total assets 
and operating revenues had immaterial impact to the Subsidiary.InvestorSubsidiaryBusinessOwnership (%)nature2017.12.31  2016.12.31The Bank    Seaward Card Co., Ltd. (“Seaward Card”)Dispatch0%100%Seaward Card was incorporated on 9 April 1999.workSubsidiaries  that  are  not  included  in  consolidated  financial  statements  are 
recognized  as  investments  accounted  for  using  equity  method  according  to  the 
accounting treatment of subsidiaries above. 
 
The Bank sold the Seaward Card Co., Ltd. to related party, Symphox Infoemation 
Co., Ltd, on 21 July 2017. Please refer to Note 6.(8) for details on disposal.(4)  Business combinations and goodwillBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of 
an  acquisition  is  measured  as  the  aggregate  of  the  consideration  transferred, 
measured  at  acquisition  date  fair  value  and  the  amount  of  any  non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the acquirer measures the 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate 
share  of  the  acquiree’s  identifiable  net  assets.    Acquisition  costs  incurred  are 
expensed. 
 
Goodwill  is  initially  measured  at  cost  being  the  excess  of  the  consideration 
transferred over the Bank’s net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary 
acquired, the difference is recognized in profit or loss. 
 
After  initial  recognition,  goodwill  is  measured  at  cost  less  any  accumulated 
impairment losses.    For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a 
business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Bank’s 
cash-generating  units  that  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the  combination, 
irrespective  of  whether  other  assets  or  liabilities  of  the  acquiree  are  assigned  to 
those units. 
 
Where  goodwill  forms  part  of  a  cash-generating  unit  and  part  of  the  operation 
within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed 
of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain 
or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is 
measured based on the relative value of the operation disposed of and the portion 
of the cash-generating unit retained.285(5)  Investments accounted for using the equity methodThe Bank’s investment in its associate is accounted for using the equity  method. 
An  associate  is  an  entity  over  which  the  Bank  has  significant  influence. A  joint 
venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of 
the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. 
 
When an associate or joint venture issues new stock, and the Bank’s interest in the 
associate or joint venture is reduced or increased as the Bank fails to acquire shares 
newly  issued  in  the  associate  or  joint  venture  proportionately  to  its  original 
ownership interest, the increase or decrease in the interest in the associate or joint 
venture is recognized in additional paid-in capital and investments accounted for 
using  the  equity  method.  When  the  interest  in  the  associate  or  joint  venture  is 
reduced,  the  cumulative  amounts  previously  recognized  in  other  comprehensive 
income  is  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  or  other  appropriate  items.  The 
aforementioned capital surplus recognized is reclassified to profit or loss on a pro 
rata basis when the Bank disposes the associate or joint venture. 
 
The financial statements of the associate or joint venture are prepared for the same 
reporting period as the Bank. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the 
accounting policies in line with those of the Bank. 
 
Instruments:  Recognition  and 
In  accordance  with 
Measurement”,  the  Bank  determines  at  each  reporting  date  whether  there  is  any 
objective evidence that the investment in the associate or an investment in a joint 
venture  is  impaired.  If  this  is  the  case,  the  Bank  calculates  the  amount  of 
impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or 
joint venture and its carrying value and recognizes the amount in the “share of profit 
or loss of an associate or joint venture” in the statement of comprehensive income 
as required by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. If using the investment’s value in use 
as  the  recoverable  amount,  the  Bank  determines  the  value  in  use  based  on  the 
following estimates: 
 
A. Future  cash  flows  the  Bank  expects  to  derive  from  the  investment  in  the 
associate  or  joint  venture,  including  cash  flows  from  the  operation  of  the 
associate and from the ultimate disposal of such investment, orIAS  39  “FinancialB. Present value of the future cash flows from dividends expected to be receivedfrom the associate and from the disposal of the investment.Because goodwill included as part of the carrying amount of an investment in an 
associate or an investment in a joint venture is not separately recognized, it is not 
tested for impairment separately by applying the requirements for testing goodwill 
impairment in IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.286Upon  loss  of  significant  influence  over  the  associate  or  joint  venture,  the  Bank 
measures and recognizes any retaining investment at its fair value. Any difference 
between  the  carrying  amount  of  the  associate  or  joint  venture  upon  loss  of 
significant  influence  and  the  fair  value  of  the  retaining  investment  and  proceeds 
from disposal is recognized in profit or loss. Furthermore, if an investment in an 
associate  becomes  an  investment  in  a  joint  venture  or  an  investment  in  a  joint 
venture  becomes  an  investment  in  an  associate,  the  Bank  continues  to  apply  the 
equity method and does not re-measure the retained interest.(6)  Foreign currency transactionsThe consolidated financial statements are presented in New Taiwan dollars, which 
is also the Bank’s functional currency. 
 
Transactions  in  foreign  currencies  are  initially  recorded  by  the  Group  entities  at 
their respective functional currency rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated 
at the functional currency closing rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. Non-
monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. Non-monetary items 
that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. 
 
All  exchange  differences  arising  on  the  settlement  of  monetary  items  or  on 
translating monetary items are taken to profit or loss in the period in which they 
arise except for the following: 
 
A. Exchange  differences  arising  from  foreign  currency  borrowings  for  an 
acquisition  of  a  qualifying  asset  to  the  extent  that  they  are  regarded  as  an 
adjustment to interest costs are included in the borrowing costs that are eligible 
for capitalization.B. Foreign  currency  items  within  the  scope  of  IAS  39  Financial  Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement are accounted for based on the accounting policy 
for financial instruments.C. Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting 
entity’s  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation  is  recognized  initially  in  other 
comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal 
of the net investment.When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in other comprehensive 
income,  any  exchange  component  of  that  gain  or  loss  is  recognized  in  other 
comprehensive income. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized 
in profit or loss, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognized in profit 
or loss.287(7)  Translation of financial statements in foreign currencyThe  assets  and  liabilities  of  foreign  operations  are  translated  into  New  Taiwan 
Dollars at  the closing rate of  exchange prevailing  at  the  reporting date  and their 
income and expenses are translated at an average rate for the period. The exchange 
differences  arising  on  the  translation  are  recognized  in  other  comprehensive 
income.  On  the  disposal  of  a  foreign  operation,  the  cumulative  amount  of  the 
exchange  differences  relating  to  that  foreign  operation,  recognized  in  other 
comprehensive  income  and  accumulated  in  the  separate  component  of  equity,  is 
reclassified  from  equity  to  profit  or  loss  when  the  gain  or  loss  on  disposal  is 
recognized. When the partial disposal involves the loss of control of a subsidiary 
that includes a foreign operation, and the retained interest after the partial disposal 
of an interest in a joint arrangement or a partial disposal of an interest in an associate 
that  includes  a  foreign  operation  is  a  financial  asset  that  includes  a  foreign 
operation. 
 
Any goodwill and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign operation and expressed in its functional currency.(8)  Cash and cash equivalentsCash and cash equivalents in consolidated balance sheet comprise cash on hand, 
demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid time deposits or investments that are 
readily  convertible  to  known  amounts  of  cash  and  which  are  subject  to  an 
insignificant risk of changes in value. The Group classifies time deposits that are 
readily convertible to known amounts of cash within twelve months and which are 
subject  to  an  insignificant  risk  of  changes  in  value  as  cash  equivalents.  The 
consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows  consist  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  in 
consolidated balance sheet, due from the Central Bank and call loans to the banks 
and securities purchased under agreements to resell that conformed to the definition 
of cash and cash equivalents in IAS 7.(9)  Bills and bonds under repurchase or resell agreementsBills and bonds under repurchase or resell agreements are accounted for under the 
financing method. Bills and bonds sold under repurchase agreements are presented 
as “Securities sold under agreements to repurchase” at the sale date. Bills and bonds 
invested  under  resell  agreements  are  presented  as  “Securities  purchased  under 
agreements to resell” at the purchase date. The difference between the purchase or 
the selling price and the contracted resell or repurchase price is recorded as interest 
income or interest expense, respectively.288(10)  Financial assets and financial liabilitiesThe  Group  classifies  its  financial  assets  as  either  financial  assets  at  fair  value 
through  profit  or  loss,  held-to-maturity  financial  assets,  investment  in  debt 
securities with no active market, financial assets carried at cost, available-for-sale 
financial assets, derivative financial assets for hedging and loans and receivables 
where appropriate. Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss and financial liabilities carried at amortized cost. 
When financial assets or liabilities are recognized initially, they  are measured  at 
fair value, plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, 
directly attributable transaction costs.   
 
The Group accounts for  regular way  purchase  or sales of financial assets  on the 
trade date (i.e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset). 
 
A. Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or lossFinancial  assets  or  liabilities  include  held  for  trading  and  designated  by  the 
Group  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  classified  as  financial  assets  or 
liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss. A  financial  asset  is  classified  as 
held for trading if: 
 
(A)  It  is  acquired  or  incurred  principally  for  the  purpose  of  selling  orrepurchasing it in the near term;(B)  On  initial  recognition  it  is  part  of  a  portfolio  of  identified  financial 
instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a 
recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or(C)  It is a derivative (except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contractor a designated and effective hedging instrument).If  a  contract  contains  one  or  more  embedded  derivatives,  the  entire  hybrid 
(combined) contract may be designated as a financial asset at fair value through 
profit  or  loss;  or  a  financial  asset  may  be  designated  as  at  fair  value  through 
profit or loss when doing so results in more relevant information, because either: 
 
(A)  It  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  a  measurement  or  recognitioninconsistency; or(B)  A group of financial assets, financial liabilities or both is managed and its 
performanceis  evaluated  on  a  fair  value  basis,  in  accordance  with  a 
documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about 
the  group  is  provided  internally  on  that  basis  to  the  key  management 
personnel.Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value. 
When  it  changes  in  fair  value  it  recognized  in  profit  or  loss.    Dividends  or 
interests on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in 
profit or loss (including those received during the period of initial investment).289For financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit and loss, the 
recognition of the full amount of change in the fair value in profit or loss only if 
the presentation of changes in the liability's credit risk in other comprehensive 
income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. 
 
If financial assets do not have quoted prices in an active market and their fair 
value  cannot  be  measured  reliably,  they  are  classified  as  financial  assets 
measured at cost on balance sheet as at the reporting date.B. Held-to-maturity financial assetsNon-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable collections and fixed 
maturity which management has the intent  and  ability to  hold  to  maturity  are 
classified  as  held-to-maturity  financial  assets  and  reported  at  amortized  cost. 
Such gains and losses are recognized when the investments are derecognized or 
impaired, as well as through amortized.C. Available-for-sale financial assetsAvailable-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses 
being recognized as a separate component of equity except for impairment loss 
and foreign  currency  exchange  related  gains  or losses, until  the investment  is 
derecognized at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in 
equity is transferred to income statement. However, any difference between the 
initial  amount  and  the  maturity  amount  of  available-for-sale  financial  assets 
shall be amortized by  effective interest  method as interest  income or  expense 
over the relevant periods.D. Loans and receivablesLoans  and  receivables  are  non-derivative  financial  assets  with  fixed  or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market other then: 
 
(A)  Those that the entity intends to sell immediately or in the near term, whichshall be classified as held for trading;(B)  Those  that  the  entity  upon  initial  recognition  designates  as  at  fair  valuethrough profit or loss;(C)  Those  that  the  entity  upon  initial  recognition  designates  as  available-for-sale; or(D)  Those for which the holder may not recover substantially all of its initialinvestment, other than because of credit deterioration.Gains  and  losses  are  recognized  when  the  investments  are  derecognized, 
impaired and as well as through the amortization process.290E. Other financial assets(A)  Investments in debt securities with no active marketInvestment  in  debt  securities  with  no  active  market  are  non-derivative 
financial assets with fixed or determinable collections that are not quoted in 
an  active  market.  Such  assets  are  carried  at  amortized  cost  using  the 
effective  interest  method.  Gains  and  losses  are  recognized  when  these 
investments  are  derecognized,  impaired  and  as  well  as  through  the 
amortization process.(B)  Financial assets carried at costInvestment  in  equity  instruments  without  quoted  market  price  and 
derivative  instruments  linked  to  or  settled  by  delivery  of  such  unquoted 
equity investments shall be measured at cost.F.  Financial liabilitiesAfter initial recognition, all financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost, 
except for financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and derivative 
financial  liabilities  for  hedging  purpose.  Such  liabilities  are  measured  at  fair 
value.The fair value of investments is determined by reference to the closing price at 
the balance sheet date for listed shares and derivatives, the net asset value for 
open-ended funds, and the closing or quoted price at the balance sheet date for 
bond and valuation techniques for debt securities with no active market, hybrid 
instruments and derivative instruments. 
 
This  cost  is  computed  as  the  amount  initially  recognized  minus  principal 
repayments,  plus  or  minus  the  cumulative  amortization  using  the  effective 
interest method of any difference between the initially recognized amount and 
the maturity amount, less impairment and unreceivable amount. This calculation 
includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that 
are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other 
premiums and discounts.(11)  Derivative financial instrumentsThe Group  entered  into  various  derivative  contracts,  including  forward  currency 
contracts,  cross-currency  swaps,  options,  futures  and  interest  rate  swaps.  Such 
derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on 
which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair 
value. Derivative financial instruments are carried as assets when the fair value is 
positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising 
from changes in fair value on derivatives are taken directly to income if a derivative 
instrument in a fair value hedge is terminated or the hedge designation is removed 
for the period.291(12)  Fair value measurementFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement 
date.    The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
 
A. In the principal market for the asset or liability, or 
B. In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for theasset or liabilityThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to by the Group.   
 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured by using the assumptions that 
market  participants  would  use  when  pricing  the  asset  or  liability,  assuming  that 
market participants in their economic best interest.   
 
A  fair  value  measurement  of  a  non-financial  asset  takes  into  account  a  market 
participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest 
and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset 
in its highest and best use.   
 
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and 
for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of 
relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.(13)  Derecognition of financial assets and liabilitiesA. Financial assetsA financial asset (or where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group 
of similar financial asset) is derecognized when: 
 
(A)  The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired. 
(B)  The Group has transferred their rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without 
material  delay  to  a  third  party  under  a  ‘pass-through’  arrangement;  and 
either (a) the Bank has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the asset, or (b) the Bank has neither transferred nor retained substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, but the Bank has transferred control 
of the asset.On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the 
carrying  amount  and  the  consideration  received  or  receivable  including  any 
cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income 
is recognized in profit or loss.292B. Financial liabilitiesA financial liability is derecognized  when the obligation under  the liability is 
discharged or cancelled or expires. 
 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender 
on  substantially  different  terms,  or  the  terms  of  an  existing  liability  are 
substantially  modified,  such  an  exchange  or  modification  is  treated  as  a 
derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and 
the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in profit or loss.(14)  Offsetting of financial instrumentsFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in 
the balance sheet if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize 
the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.(15)  Impairment of financial assetsThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence 
that a financial asset other than the financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss is impaired. A financial asset is deemed to be impaired when, and only when, 
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more loss events that 
has  occurred  after  the  initial  recognition  of  the  asset  and  that  loss  event  has  an 
impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset. The carrying amount of the 
financial asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount 
of the loss is recognized in profit or loss. 
 
A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale equity 
instrument below its cost is considered a loss event. 
 
Objective evidence may include: 
 
A. Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor; or 
B. A breach of contract,  such as a default or delinquency in  interest  or principalpayments; orC. It becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financialreorganization; orD. The  disappearance  of  an  active  market  for  that  financial  asset  because  offinancial difficulties.293The  Group  applies  the  following  methods  to  determine  the  amount  of  any 
impairment loss:   
 
A. Available-for-sale financial assetsWhen a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been 
recognized in other comprehensive income and there is objective evidence that 
the  asset  is  impaired,  the  cumulative  loss  that  had  been  recognized  in  other 
comprehensive  income  shall  be  reclassified  from  equity  to  profit  or  loss  as  a 
reclassification  adjustment  even  though  the  financial  asset  has  not  been 
derecognized.   
 
In  the  case  of  equity  investments  classified  as  available-for-sale,  impairment 
losses  are  not  reversed  through  profit  or  loss;  increases  in  its  fair  value  after 
impairment  are  recognized  directly  in  other  comprehensive  income.  If,  in  a 
subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for 
sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring 
after  the  impairment  losses  was  recognized  in  profit  or  loss,  the  impairment 
losses are reversed through, with the amount of the reversal recognized in profit 
or loss.B. Financial assets carried at amortized costIf there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on a financial asset carried 
at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured by the 
difference  between  the  asset’s  carrying  amount  and  the  present  value  of 
estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest 
rate.  The  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  asset  is  reduced  either  directly  or 
through the use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognized 
in profit or loss. 
 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the 
decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment 
was  recognized,  the  previously  recognized  impairment  loss  is  reversed  either 
directly or by adjusting an allowance account. The reversal shall not result in a 
carrying  amount  of  the  financial  asset  that  exceeds  what  the  amortized  cost 
would  have  been  had  the  impairment  not  been  recognized  at  the  date  the 
impairment  is  reversed. The  amount  of  the  reversal  is  recognized  in  profit  or 
loss.C. Loans and receivablesThe  Group  first  assesses  whether  objective  evidence  of  impairment  exists 
individually for loans and receivables that are individually significant. If there 
is objective evidence that an impairment loss on individual loans and receivables 
has  been  incurred,  the  amount  of  impairment  loss  should  be  assessed 
individually. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on a loan and 
receivable that is not individually significant has been incurred, the Bank shall 
include  those  assets  in  a  group  of  financial  assets  with  similar  credit  risk 
characteristics and collectively assess them for impairment.294If  there  is  objective  evidence  that  an  impairment  loss  has  been  incurred,  the 
amount of loss is  measured as the difference between the  carrying  amount  of 
loans  and  receivables  and  the  present  value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows 
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred). The present value 
of the estimated future cash flows on loans and receivables is discounted at the 
financial assets original effective interest rate. If a loan has a variable interest 
rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective 
interest rate. 
 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the 
decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment 
was  recognized  (such  as  an  improvement  in  the  debtor’s  credit  rating),  the 
previously  recognized  impairment  loss  shall  be  reversed  either  directly  or  by 
adjusting  an  allowance  account.  The  reversal  shall  not  result  in  a  carrying 
amount of the loan and receivable that exceeds what the amortized cost would 
have been had the impairment not been recognized at the date the impairment is 
reversed. The amount of the reversal shall be recognized in profit or loss. 
 
In addition, in accordance with the “Regulations Governing the Procedures for 
Banking  Institutions  to  Evaluate Assets  and  Deal  with  Non-performing/Non-
accrual  Loans”,  the  Bank  shall  allocate  sufficient  loan  loss  provision  and 
reserves against liability on guarantees. Classification system classifies normal 
credit assets under the first category, with poorer credit assets assessed based on 
the securities and the length of time overdue, respectively classified as second 
category  special  mention,  third  category    expectation  of  recovery,  fourth 
category difficulty of recovery, and fifth category no hope of recovery. 
 
The minimum loan loss provision and guarantee reserve shall be the sum of 1% 
of the outstanding balance of Category One credit asset’s claim (excluding assets 
that represent claims against an ROC government agency), 2% of the balance of 
Category Two credit assets, 10% of the balance of Category Three credit assets, 
50%  of  the  balance  of  Category  Four  credit  assets,  and  the  full  balance  of 
Category Five credit assets.(16)  Impairment of non-financial assetsThe  Group  assesses  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period  whether  there  is  any 
indication  that  an  asset  in  the  scope  of  IAS  36  “Impairment  of  Assets”  may  be 
impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an 
asset  is  required,  the  Bank  estimates  the  asset’s  recoverable  amount. An  asset’s 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating units (“CGU”) 
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual 
asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent 
of those from  other assets  or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount  of an 
asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and 
is written down to its recoverable amount.295For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to 
whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may 
no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Bank estimates 
the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount. A previously recognized 
impairment  loss  is  reversed  only  if  there  has  been  an  increase  in  the  estimated 
service  potential  of  an  asset  which  in  turn  increases  the  recoverable  amount. 
However, the reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not 
exceed its recoverable  amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that  would  have 
been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for 
the asset in prior years. 
 
A cash generating unit, or groups of cash-generating units, to which goodwill has 
been allocated is tested for impairment annually at the same time, irrespective of 
whether  there  is  any  indication  of  impairment.  If  an  impairment  loss  is  to  be 
recognized,  it  is  first  allocated  to  reduce  the  carrying  amount  of  any  goodwill 
allocated to the cash generating unit (group of units), then to the other assets of the 
unit (group of units) pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in 
the unit (group of units). Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed 
in future periods for any reason. 
 
An impairment loss of continuing operations or a reversal of such impairment loss 
is recognized in profit or loss.(17)  Financial guarantee contractsFinancial guarantee contracts issued by the Group are those contracts that require 
a  payment  to  be  made  to  reimburse  the  holder  for  a  loss  it  incurs  because  the 
specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of 
a  debt  instrument.  Financial  guarantee  contracts  are  recognized  initially  as  a 
liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to 
the issuance of the guarantee.(18)  Foreclosed propertiesForeclosed  properties  of  the  Group  represent  assets  acquired  by  repossession  of 
collateral for realization and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
on  the  balance  sheet  date.  If  there  is  an  objective  evidence  of  impairment,  the 
impairment loss shall be recognized.(19)  LeaseAll the leasing contracts of the Group follow the regulations of IAS17 and SIC4 
and are categorized as operating lease. If the Group is the lessor, the asset in  the 
operating lease is categorized under “Investment properties” account. If the Group 
is the lessee, the asset then is recorded as leased asset in the balance sheet. The rent 
payable and receivable of operating lease are recorded by its rental duration using 
straight-line  method.  They  are  recorded  as  “Other  general  and  administrative 
expenses” and “Other net non-interest income”.296(20)  Property and equipmentProperty and equipment  is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation  and/or 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of dismantling 
and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located and borrowing 
costs  for  construction  in  progress  if  the  recognition  criteria  are  met.  When 
significant parts of property and equipment are required to be replaced in intervals, 
the Bank recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and 
depreciation, respectively. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost 
is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement 
if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are 
recognized in profit or loss as incurred. 
 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line method over the following estimated 
useful lives: 
 
Building 
Machinery and equipment 
Transportation equipment 
Miscellaneous equipment 
 
An item of property and equipment and any significant part initially recognized is 
derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefit is expected from 
its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is included 
in profit or loss. 
 
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed 
at each financial year end, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.5 - 60 
years 
3 -      8  years 
3 -      7  years 
years 
3 - 15(21)  Investment propertiesInvestment  properties  are  measured  initially  at  cost,  including  transaction  costs. 
The carrying amount includes the cost of replacing part of an existing investment 
property  at  the  time  that  cost  is  incurred  if  the  recognition  criteria  are  met  and 
excludes the costs of day to day servicing of an investment property.    Subsequent 
to initial recognition, investment properties are measured using the fair value model 
in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  IAS  40  “Investment  property”  for  that 
model.  Gains  or  losses  arising  from  changes  in  the  fair  values  of  investment 
properties are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in 
the period in which they arise, other than those that meet the criteria to be classified 
as held  for sale (or are included in  a disposal  group that is classified as held for 
sale)  in  accordance  with  IFRS  5  “Non-current  Assets  Held  for  Sale  and 
Discontinued Operations”.297Investment properties are derecognized when either they have been disposed of or 
when the investment  property is  permanently withdrawn from use and no future 
economic  benefit  is  expected  from  its  disposal.  The  difference  between  the  net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognized in profit or 
loss in the period of derecognition. 
 
The fair value of investment properties is measured on the character, location and 
condition of specific property.(22)  Intangible assetsIntangible  assets  acquired  separately  are  measured  on  initial  recognition  at  cost.   
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is its fair value as 
at  the  date  of  acquisition.    Following  initial  recognition,  intangible  assets  are 
carried  at  cost  less  any  accumulated  amortization  and  accumulated  impairment 
losses,  if  any.    Internally  generated  intangible  assets,  excluding  capitalized 
development costs, are not capitalized and expenditure is reflected in profit or loss 
for the year in which the expenditure is incurred. 
 
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. 
 
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life and 
assessed for impairment  whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset 
may  be  impaired.  The  amortization  period  and  the  amortization  method  for  an 
intangible  asset  with  a  finite  useful  life  are  reviewed  at  least  at  the  end  of  each 
financial  year.  Changes  in  the  expected  useful  life  or  the  expected  pattern  of 
consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by 
changing  the  amortization  period  or  method,  as  appropriate,  and  are  treated  as 
changes in accounting estimates. 
 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested for 
impairment annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level.    The 
assessment  of  indefinite  life  is  reviewed  annually  to  determine  whether  the 
indefinite life continues to be supportable.    If not, the change in useful life from 
indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. 
 
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as 
the difference between the net  disposal  proceeds and the carrying amount  of the 
asset and are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized.

of profit or loss for the period in respect of current tax and deferred tax. 
 
Current income tax 
 
Current  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities  for  the  current  and  prior  periods  are 
measured  at  the  amount  expected  to  be  recovered  from  or  paid  to  the  taxation 
authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted  by  the  end  of  the  reporting  period.  Current  income  tax  relating  to  items 
recognized in  other comprehensive income or directly in  equity is  recognized in 
other comprehensive income or equity and not in profit or loss. 
 
The 10% income tax for undistributed earnings is recognized as income tax expense 
in the subsequent year when the distribution proposal is approved by the board of 
directors. 
 
Deferred tax 
 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between the 
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes. 
 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except: 
 
A. Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at 
the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit 
or loss;B. In  respect  of  taxable  temporary  differences  associated  with  investments  in 
subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry 
forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable 
that  taxable  profit  will  be  available  against  which  the  deductible  temporary 
differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can 
be utilized, except: 
 
A. Where  the  deferred  tax  asset  relating  to  the  deductible  temporary  difference 
arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;299B. In  respect  of  deductible  temporary  differences  associated  with  investments  in 
subsidiaries,  associates  and  interests  in  joint  ventures,  deferred  tax  assets  are 
recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences 
will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilized.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax 
rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting 
date. The measurement of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities reflects the 
tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Bank expects, at 
the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets 
and  liabilities.  Deferred  tax  relating  to  items  recognized  outside  profit  or  loss  is 
recognized outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognized in correlation 
to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity. Deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognized 
accordingly.Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable 
right exists to set off current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities 
and  the  deferred  taxes  relate  to  the  same  taxable  entity  and  the  same  taxation 
authority.In accordance with Article 49 of the Financial Holding Company Act, the Company 
and  its  parent  company  jointly  filed  corporation  income  tax  returns  and  10% 
surcharge  on  undistributed  retained  earnings  since  2002  under  the  integrated 
income tax system. Such effects on current tax and deferred tax are accounted for 
as receivable or payables. 
 
Effective  from  1  January,  2006,  the  Company  has  considered  the  impact  of  the 
“Alternative Minimum Tax Act” to estimate their income tax liabilities.(24)  Employee benefitsDefined contribution plans 
 
The Bank has a pension plan covering all full-time employees (the defined benefit 
plan). Under the plan, pension benefit payments for each employee are based on 
the  employee’s  years  of  service  and  final  average  compensation.  The  Bank  has 
established two employee retirement fund committees to supervise the employees’ 
retirement  fund  based  on  the  regulations  of  the  employee  retirement  plan. 
Contribution to the pension fund is made to the separate accounts of the above two 
committees monthly. The Bank makes contributions to the pension plan, which is 
administered and operated by an independent employee retirement fund committee. 
The pension plan is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Pension 
benefits for employees of the overseas subsidiaries and the branches are provided 
in accordance with the respective local regulations.300The Labor Pension Act of the ROC (the “Act”), which adopts a defined contribution 
pension plan, is effective on 1 July 2005. In accordance with the Act, employees of 
the  Bank  may  elect  to  be  subject  to  either  the Act,  and  maintain  their  seniority 
before  the  enforcement  of  the  Act,  or  the  pension  mechanism  of  the  Labor 
Standards Act.  For  employees  subject  to  the Act,  the  Bank  shall  make  monthly 
contributions to the employees’ individual pension accounts on a basis 6% of the 
employees’ monthly wages. Monthly contributions are recognized as pension costs. 
 
Defined benefit plans 
 
Post-employment benefit plan that is classified as a defined benefit plan uses the 
Projected  Unit  Credit  Method  to  measure  its  obligations  and  costs  based  on 
actuarial assumptions. 
Re-measurements,  comprising  of  the  effect  of  the  actuarial  gains  and  losses,  the 
effect of the 
asset ceiling (excluding net interest) and the return on plan assets, excluding net 
interest are recognized as other comprehensive income with a corresponding debit 
or credit to other equity in the period in which they occur.   
 
Past service costs are recognized in profit or loss on the earlier of: 
 
A.  The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and 
B.  The date that the Group recognizes restructuring-related costs 
 
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit 
liability  or  asset,  both  as  determined  at  the  start  of  the  annual  reporting  period, 
taking account of any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the 
period as a result of contribution and benefit payment. 
 
Employee preferential interest rate deposits 
 
The Bank offers its employees with preferential deposit, including providing finite 
amount preferential interest rate deposits to current employees and providing the 
preferential interest rate deposits to current employees and retired employees after 
their  retirement. The  difference  between  the  interest  rate  of  preferential  deposits 
and the market rate is recognized as employee benefits.   
 
The finite amount preferential deposits that the Bank paid to its current employees 
are calculated monthly on accrual basis. The difference between the interest rate of 
preferential  deposit  and  the  market  rate  is  recorded  as  “Employee  benefits 
expenses”.  In  accordance  with  the  article  30  of  the  “Regulations  Governing  the 
Preparation of Financial Reports by Public Banks”, when the interest incurred from 
preferential interest rate deposits exceed the interest generated from market rate, it 
should  be  considered  the  actuarial  amount  according  to  defined  benefit  plan 
regulated on IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” since the employee’s retirement date.301(25)  ProvisionsProvisions  are  recognized  when  the  Bank  has  a  present  obligation  (legal  or 
constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate  can  be  made  of  the  amount  of  the  obligation. Where  the  Bank  expects 
some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognized as a 
separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. If the effect of 
the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-
tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a borrowing 
cost.(26)  Interest incomeInterest income is recognized over the period by applying the interest rate method 
and measured except for delinquent accounts and troubled accounts whose interest 
is recognized when received.(27)  Service feeThe  Group  earns  service  fee  from  a  diverse  range  of  service  it  provide  to  its 
customers. Fee income can be divided into the following two categories: 
 
A. Fee income on transactions conducted or from services provided over a periodof time.B. Fee income from providing transaction services. 
 
The fair value of the award credits granted to the bank card holders is deferred and 
recognized as fee income when the award credits are redeemed or expire.(28)  Operating segment informationAn  operating  segment  is  a  component  of  an  entity  that  has  the  follow 
characteristics: 
 
A. Engaging  in  business  activities  from  which  it  may  earn  revenues  and  incurexpenses;B. Whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating 
decision marker to make decisions about resource to be allocated to the segment 
and assess its performance, andC. For which discrete financial information is available.3025.  Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptionsThe preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements require management 
to  make  judgments,  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of 
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at 
the  end  of  the  reporting  period.  However,  uncertainty  about  these  assumptions  and 
estimates  could  result  in  outcomes  that  require  a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying 
amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods. 
 
(1)  JudgmentIn the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made 
the  following  judgments,  which  have  the  most  significant  effect  on  the  amounts 
recognized in the consolidated financial statements: 
 
A. Investment propertiesCertain properties of the Bank comprise a portion that is held to earn rentals or 
for  capital  appreciation  and  another  portion  that  is  owner-occupied.  The 
property is  classified as  investment  property in  its entirety only if the portion 
that is owner-occupied is under 5% of the total property.B. Operating lease commitment－the Group as the lessorThe Bank has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property 
portfolio.  The  Bank  has  determined,  based  on  an  evaluation  of  the  terms  and 
conditions of the arrangements, that it retains all the significant risks and rewards 
of  ownership  of  these  properties  and  accounts  for  the  contracts  as  operating 
leases.(2)  Estimates and assumptionsThe  key  assumptions  concerning  the  future  and  other  key  sources  of  estimation 
uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year are discussed below: 
 
A. Impairment losses on loans and receivablesThe Group review their loans and receivables to assess whether an impairment 
loss should be recorded in profit or loss on a monthly basis. When the Group 
determines whether to recognize impairment losses, they mainly decide if there 
is any observable evidence indicating possible impairment. The evidence may 
include  observable  information  indicating  unfavorable  changes  in  debtor 
payment  status,  or  sovereign  or  the  local  economic  situation  related  to  debt 
payment. While analysing expected cash flow, the estimates by the management 
are  based  on  past  losses  experience  on  the  assets  of  similar  credit  risk 
characteristics.  The  Group  periodically  reviews  methods  and  assumptions 
behind the amount and schedule of expected cash flow, to reduce the difference 
between expected and actual loss.303B. Fair value of financial instrumentsWhere the fair value of financial instruments cannot be derived from an active 
market  or  a  quoted  price,  it  is  determined  using  a  valuation  technique. 
Observable market data for similar financial instruments is utilized as inputs to 
measure fair value. If observable inputs are not available, prudent assumptions 
are used for estimating fair value. In applying valuation techniques, the Group 
adopts pricing models in accordance with its procedure for valuation. All models 
are adjusted to ensure that their results reflect actual data and market prices.C. Impairment of non-financial assetsImpairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit 
exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to 
sell and its value in use. The fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on 
available data from binding sales transactions in an arm’s length transaction of 
similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs that would be 
directly attributable to the disposal of the asset or cash generating unit. The value 
in  use  calculation  is  based  on  a  discounted  cash  flow  model. The  cash  flows 
projections are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include 
restructuring  activities  that  the  Group  is  not  yet  committed  to  or  significant 
future  investments  that  will  enhance  the  asset’s  performance  of  the  cash 
generating  unit  being  tested. The  recoverable  amount  is  most  sensitive  to  the 
discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected 
future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. 
 
The Bank determines whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis and when 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. This requires an 
estimation of the recoverable amount of the CGU or groups of CGUs to which 
goodwill is allocated. Estimating the recoverable amount requires the Bank to 
make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGU or groups of 
CGUs and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present 
value of those cash flows.D. Award credits and deferred incomeThe Bank recognizes the fair value of all considerations received or receivable 
as  revenue  at  the  time  of  sale,  and  estimates  the  cost  and  related  liabilities 
resulting from the awards given. The consideration allocated to the award credits 
should  be  deferred  and  only  recognized  as  revenue  when  award  credits  are 
redeemed and the Bank fulfils its obligations to supply awards. As points issued 
under  the  program  do  not  expire,  such  estimates  are  subject  to  significant 
uncertainty.304E. Income taxUncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations 
and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of 
international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of 
existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results 
and  the  assumptions  made,  or  future  changes  to  such  assumptions,  could 
necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The 
Group  establishes  provisions,  based  on  reasonable  estimates,  for  possible 
consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective counties in which 
it operates. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as 
experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations 
by  the  taxable  entity  and  the  responsible  tax  authority.  Such  differences  of 
interpretation may arise on a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions 
prevailing in the respective Group entity’s domicile. 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognized for all carry forward of unused tax losses and 
unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is 
probable  that  taxable  profit  will  be  available  or  there  are  sufficient  taxable 
temporary differences against which the unused tax losses, unused tax credits or 
deductible  temporary  differences  can  be  utilized. The  amount  of  deferred  tax 
assets determined to be recognized is based upon the likely timing and the level 
of future taxable profits and taxable temporary differences together with future 
tax planning strategies.F.  Pension benefitsThe  cost  of  post-employment  benefit  and  the  present  value  of  the  pension 
obligation  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans  are  determined  using  actuarial 
valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions. These 
include the determination of the discount rate and future salary increases. 
 
According  to  internal  regulation  of  the  Bank  or  hiring  agreement,  IAS  19 
“Employee  Benefit”  applies  to  the  excess  interest  of  retiring  employee 
preferential interest rate deposits once the employee is retired.G. Fair value of investment propertyThe  fair  value  of  investment  property  is  derived  from  valuation  techniques, 
including  income  approach  (such  as  discounted  cash  flow  model  and  direct 
capitalization  approach),  comparison  approach,  and  cost  approach,  while  the 
assumptions used in applying valuation techniques will have impacts on the fair 
value of investment property. Please refer Note 6.(11) for more details.3056.  Breakdown of Significant Accounts(1)  Cash and cash equivalentsCash on hand

value  of  investment  property  based  on  the  “Regulations  on  Real  Estate 
Appraisal” on 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.Fair  value  has  been  supported  by  observable  evidences  in  the  market.  The 
appraisal approaches used are mainly the income approach (such as discounted 
cash flow model and direct capitalization approach), sales comparison approach 
and cost approach, etc.a.  Office building has market liquidity and their rent levels are more comparable 
with  similar  items  from  the  same  neighborhood.  The  fair  value  has  been 
determined by comparison approach and income approach.316Disposals2016.12.312017.01.01TransfersDisposals2017.12.31Net  rental  income  is  based  on  the  current  market  practices,  assuming  an 
annual rent increase of between 0% to 1.5% to extrapolate the total income 
of  the  underlying  property,  excluding  losses  as  a  result  of  idle  and  other 
reasons and related operation costs.According to the ROC Real Estate Appraisers Association Gazette No.5, the 
house tax has been determined based on the reference tables of current house 
values assessed for each city/county to estimate the total current house value 
assessed. House tax is calculated based on the tax rates provided by the House 
Tax Act and the actual payment date.Land value tax is based on the changes in the announced land values of the 
underlying  property  in  the  past  few  years  and  the  actual  payment  data,  to 
further extrapolate the announced land value in the future.The  replacement  allowance  is  calculated  renovation  cost  base  on  15% 
construction cost, presume the useful life of 20 years, according to the ROC

calculation, using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by 
the management of the Bank covering a five-year period.B. The calculation  of value in  use for the unit is  most  sensitive to  the followingassumptions:a.  Discount ratesDiscount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to

The Bank adopts a defined contribution plan in accordance with the Labor Pension 
Act  of  the  R.O.C.  Under  the  Labor  Pension Act,  the  Bank  will  make  monthly 
contributions  of  no  less  than  6%  of  the  employees’  monthly  wages  to  the 
employees’ individual pension accounts. The Bank has made monthly contributions 
of  6%  of  each  individual  employee’s  salaries  or  wages  to  employees’  pension 
accounts. 
 
Expenses  under  the  defined  contribution  plan  for  the  years  ended  31  December 
2017 and 2016 were $331,604 thousand and $304,365 thousand, respectively, and 
recorded as “Employee benefits expenses”.323Defined benefit plan 
 
The Bank adopts a defined benefit plan in accordance with the Labor Standards Act 
of the R.O.C. The pension benefits are disbursed based on the units of service years 
and the average salaries in the last month of the service year. Two units per year are 
awarded for the first 15 years of services while one unit per year is awarded after 
the completion of the 15th year. The total units shall not exceed 45 units. Under the 
Labor  Standards Act,  the  Bank  contributes  an  amount  equivalent  to  2%  of  the 
employees’  total  salaries  and  wages  on  a  monthly  basis  to  the  pension  fund 
deposited  at  the  Bank  of  Taiwan  in  the  name  of  the  administered  pension  fund 
committee.  Before  the  end  of  each  year,  the  Bank  assesses  the  balance  in  the 
designated labor pension fund. Based on Article 56 of Labor Standards Act of the 
R.O.C., if the amount is inadequate to pay pensions calculated for workers retiring 
in the same year, the Bank will make up the difference in one appropriation before 
the end of March the following year. 
 
The  Ministry  of  Labor  is  in  charge  of  establishing  and  implementing  the  fund 
utilization  plan  in  accordance  with  the  Regulations  for  Revenues,  Expenditures, 
Safeguard  and  Utilization  of  the  Labor  Retirement  Fund.    The  pension  fund  is 
invested in-house or under mandation, based on a passive-aggressive investment 
strategy for long-term profitability.    The Ministry of Labor establishes checks and 
risk  management  mechanism  based  on  the  assessment  of  risk  factors  including 
market risk, credit risk and liquidity  risk, in order to maintain adequate manager 
flexibility to achieve targeted return without over-exposure of risk.    With regard 
to utilization of the pension fund, the minimum earnings in the annual distributions 
on the final financial statement shall not be less than the earnings attainable from 
the amounts accrued from two-year time deposits with the interest rates offered by 
local banks.    Treasury Funds can be used to cover the deficits after the approval 
of the competent authority. The Bank expects to contribute $196,926 thousand to 
its defined benefit plan during the 12 months beginning after 31 December 2017. 
 
As  of  31  December  2017  and  2016,  the  Bank  expects  its  defined  benefits  plan 
obligation to become due in 2028.

The methodologies and assumptions used by the Group to estimate the abovefair value of financial instruments are summarized as follows:a.  The carrying value of short-term financial instruments, such as cash and cash 
equivalents,  receivables,  securities  purchased  under  agreements  to  resell, 
securities  sold  under  agreements  to  repurchase,  payables,  refundable 
deposits, guarantee deposits, borrowed funds, due from the Central Bank and 
call loans to  banks and due to  the Central  Bank and call loans from  banks 
arising in the ordinary course of business, approximate the fair value because 
of the relatively short period of time between their origination and expected 
realization.b.  Quoted market prices, if available, are utilized as estimates of the fair values 
of financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale 
financial instruments, held-to-maturity financial assets, purchase of foreign 
exchange, debt instrument investment without active market and derivatives 
financial instruments of hedging. If no quoted market prices exist for certain 
financial  instruments,  the  fair  value  of  such  instruments  has  been  derived 
based on pricing models. A price model incorporates all factors that market 
participants  would  consider  in  setting  a  price.  The  discounted  cash  flow 
technique  is  used  to  estimate  the  fair  value  of  a  debt  instrument  where  an 
active market does not exist. The estimates, hypotheses and discount rates for 
valuation  refer  to  quoted  prices,  from  financial  instruments,  of  financial 
instruments  having  substantially  the  same  terms  and  characteristics, 
including  the  credit  quality  of  debtors,  the  remaining  term  over  which  the 
contractual  interest  rate  is  fixed,  the  remaining  term  to  repayment  of  the 
principal, and the currency in which the payments are to be made.c.  Discounts  and  loans,  deposits,  financial  debentures  payable  and  principals 
received from the sale of structured products are classified as interest-bearing 
financial  instruments.  Thus,  their  carrying  value  is  equivalent  to  their  fair 
value. The  face  value  of  delinquent  accounts  deducted  from  allowance  for 
doubtful accounts is adopted as fair value.d.  Investments  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method  were  non-listed  stocks 
that  do  not  have  a  quoted  price  in  an  active  market. The  variability  in  the 
range of reasonable fair value estimates is not insignificant for that instrument 
and  the  probabilities  of  the  various  estimates  within  the  range  cannot  be 
reasonably  assessed.  Since  the  fair  value  cannot  be  reliably  measured,  the 
carrying amount should be the reasonable basis to estimate the fair value.e.  The  fair  value  of  financial  debentures  payable  which  designated  as  at  fair 
value  through  profit  or  loss  is  estimated  by  discounting  future  cash  flows 
using  rates  currently  available  for  debt  on  similar  terms  and  remaining 
maturities.353f.  If  the  derivatives  do  not  have  market  prices  available  to  compare,  the 
discounted-cash- flow model is applied to forward currency and interest rate 
swap  and  Black-Scholes  model,  Binomial  Option  Price  model  or  Monte-
Carlo-method are applied to option derivatives.g.  The  Bank  adopts  the  exchange  rates  and  market  interest  rates  provide  by 
Thomson  Reuters’  system  to  evaluate  the  fair  value  of  forward  currency, 
currency swap, interest rate swap and cross currency swap. The average price 
or closing price is used to figure the fair value of each contract.h.  Under the assumption that the Bank will not default, the Bank determines its 
credit  value  adjustment  by  multiplying  three  factors,  probability  of  default 
(“PD”), loss given default (“LGD”), and exposure at default (“EAD”) of the 
counterparty. On the other hand, under the assumption that the counterparty 
will  not  default,  the  Bank  calculates  its  debit  value  adjustments  by 
multiplying three factors, PD, LGD, and EAD of the Bank.C. The estimated exposure at default for current period is evaluated by consideringthe fair value of the derivative instruments traded at Taipei Exchange.D. The Bank sets estimated LGD at 60 % for most of the counterparties, but mayapply other assumptions when risk character and data are available.E. The Bank has considered the adjustment of credit risk in the calculation of the 
fair  value  of  financial  instruments  to  reflect  credit  risk  and  credit  quality  of 
counterparty and the Bank, respectively.(2)  The fair value hierarchy information of the financial instrumentsA. The definition of the hierarchy of the financial instruments is measured at fairvalue:1st Level:  Quoted  (unadjusted)  market  prices  in  active  markets  for  identical 
assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. 
2nd Level: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect 
on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
3rd Level: Techniques which  use inputs  which have a significant  effect  on therecorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.For  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  recognized  in  the  financial  statement  on  a 
recurring basis, the bank determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization at the end of each reporting 
period.354B. The Group measures financial instruments and investment properties based on 
recurring  basis,  and  assets  held  for  sale  are  measured  on  the  lower  of  non-
recurring basis and fair value minus cost of goods sold. The Group’s fair value 
hierarchy is described as follows:2017.12.311st Level2nd Level3rd LevelTotal$4,779,697$-$-$4,779,69781,440,78321,978,45249,939170,563,632--3,396,372--1,547,372--8,720,3478,822,87276346,215,235--53,639,010-24,420,48524,891,7232016.12.312nd Level3rd Level103,419,235170,613,57115,833,022132,106,292541,3551,547,37253,639,01049,94533,172,55633,718,696Total12,435,88785,891,057541,355--49,94531,7244,1011st LevelItemNon-derivative financial instrumentsAssetsFinancial assets at fair value through profit or lossFinancial assets held for tradingStocksBondsOthersAvailable-for-sale financial assetsStocksBondsOthersInvestment propertiesLiabilitiesFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or lossDesignated at fair value through profit or lossBondsFinancial liabilities held for tradingBondsDerivative financial instrumentsAssetsFinancial assets at fair value through profit or lossLiabilitiesFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or lossItemNon-derivative financial instrumentsAssetsFinancial assets at fair value through profit or lossFinancial assets held for tradingBondsOthersAvailable-for-sale financial assetsStocksBondsOthersInvestment propertiesLiabilitiesFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or lossDesignated at fair value through profit or lossBondsDerivative financial instrumentsAssetsFinancial assets at fair value through profit or lossLiabilitiesFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss355$18,427,748$35,117,188-8,454,57681,870,6233,586,499--3,1372,21793,126,34182658,045,122917,355-39,491,90835,020,47730,943,591$-$53,544,936-3,278,958--1,554,600-17,622,70017,699,26893,126,34111,734,360139,915,7454,503,8541,554,60039,491,90852,646,31448,645,076Transfers between 1st Level and 2nd Level during the period

The Group’s Risk Management Department is responsible for validating the fair 
value measurements and ensuring that the results of the valuation are in line with 
market  conditions,  based  on  independent  and  reliable  inputs  which  are 
consistent  with  other  information,  and  represent  exercisable  prices.  The 
Department analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which 
are  required  to  be  re-measured  or  re-assessed  as  per  the  Group’s  accounting

not meet the criteria for full removal are mostly made up of debt securities used 
as counterparty collateral for repurchase agreements or equity securities lent out 
as  part  of  securities  lending  agreement.  The  nature  of  these  transactions  are 
secured  loans,  and  reflects  the  liability  where  the  Bank  are  obligated  to 
repurchase the transferred financial assets according to  a fixed price in future 
periods. With respect to such transactions, the Bank will not be able to use, sell 
or  pledge  such  transferred  financial  assets  during  the  effective  period.   
However the Bank is still exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk, hence they 
are not removed.359The following table analyses financial assets and financial liabilities that have

but it executed enforceable master netting arrangement or other similar agreements 
with  counterparties.  Financial  instruments  subject  to  enforceable  master  netting 
arrangement or other similar agreements could be settled at net amount as chosen 
by the counterparties, or the financial instruments could be settled at gross amount 
if not.    However, if one of the counterparty defaults, the other party could choose 
to settle the transaction at net amount.360Information  related  to  offsetting  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  is

The Bank’s risk control and hedging strategy follows the requirement of customer 
service-oriented banking industry and regulatory environment. In order to comply 
with the above requirements, the Bank adopted different risk management methods 
to identify its risks and the Bank followed the spirit and regulation of the “Basel 
Accord” to keep strengthening its assets and the practices of capital management 
to maintain the best capital adequacy ratio.   
 
The  Bank  organized  the  risk  management  committee  and  its  responsibilities  are 
illustrated as below: 
 
A. To amend the risk management policies, risk appetite or risk tolerance and reportthe above issues to board of directors for approval.B. To manage and decide the strategy about the Bank’s credit risk, market risk andoperational risk management.C. To report the significant risk management issues, such as credit ratings, marketassessment and risk indicators.D. To analyze the issues that the Bank’s business unit brought up for discussion. 
E. Other issues. 
 
The  Bank  organized  a  risk  management  group  to  monitor,  lead,  develop,  and 
establish the integral risk management framework.(6)  Market riskMarket risk is the potential loss arising from adverse movements of market price, 
such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity securities. 
 
The  Bank  organized  market  risk  management  department  and  the  committee  of 
assets  and  liabilities  management  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  market  risk 
management.  The  department  and  committee  periodically  examine  the  Bank’s 
structure of assets and liabilities; plan the pricing principle of deposit and loan and 
financing and using scheme of medium and long term funding while executing the 
market  risk  management,  the  market  risk  management  department  periodically 
provides  the  related  information  of  management  and  reports  to  the  authorized 
managers of the Bank for the management system, such as valuating position, risk 
limit management, calculating of profit and loss, pricing model and risk analysis, 
in order to control the overall market risk.362Market risk management process 
 
A. Identification and measurementThe  operations  department  and  risk  management  department  of  the  Bank 
identified  the  market  risk  factors  of  risk  exposure  position,  and  measured  the 
market risk further. Market risk factors are the components that could have an 
impact on value of financial instrument, such as interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates, equity securities…etc., including position, gain and loss, the loss of stress 
test, sensitivity (DV01, Delta, Vega, Gamma) and Value at Risk (VaR)…etc., to 
measure  the  extent  of  investment  portfolio  that  is  influenced  by  interest  risk, 
foreign exchange risk and equity securities.B. Monitoring and reportingThe risk management department periodically reports the execution of market 
risk  management  target,  position  and  gain/loss  control,  sensitivity  analysis, 
stress test, and VaR of equity securities to the board of directors, and helps the 
board of directors to fully understand the status of market risk management. The 
Bank  also  establishes  a  clear  reporting  process.  Each  transaction  has  the 
requirements about limitation and stop-loss points. If the transaction reaches its 
stop-loss limitation, stop-loss process will be implemented immediately. If the 
stop-loss  process  is  not  implemented,  the  transaction  department  should 
document  the  reason  of  non-implementing  stop  loss  process  and  responding 
plan. Furthermore, the department shall report to the executive management for 
approval and report to the board of directors regularly.Risk management policy of the trading book 
 
The trading book is the portfolio of financial instruments and physical investment 
for the purpose of trading or the hedge on the trading book. Portfolio is held for 
trading,  which  is  intended  to  earn  the  profit  from  bid-ask  spread. Any  positions 
aside from the above trading book will be in the banking book. 
 
A. StrategyIn order to control market risk effectively and ensure flexibility in operating the 
transaction strategy, the Bank carries out various assessment and control. The 
portfolio  of  trading  book  has  the  risk  limitation  of  each  investment  portfolio 
which is set according to the transaction strategy, category of investment and the 
annual profit target.363B. Policy and procedureThe Bank sets the “Regulation Governing of Market Risk Management” as the 
important  regulation  that  should  be  complied  with  when  holding  trading 
portfolio.C. Valuation policyIf the financial instruments of trading book have market values, they should be 
evaluated at least once each day by the information that is from an independent 
source and easily accessible. If it’s evaluated by a model, a mathematical model 
should be used prudently, and the assumptions and parameters of the valuation 
model should be regularly reviewed and examined.D. Method of measurementa.  The assumption and calculation of VaR: see VaR section. 
b.  The Bank executes the stress test monthly with the following scenarios: the 
fluctuation  of  interest  rate  at  100bp,  equity  securities  at  15%  and  foreign 
exchange rate at 3%, and reports to the risk management committee regularly.Interest risk management of trading book 
 
A. Definition of interest riskInterest risk is the risk that the trading portfolios suffer losses or the change of 
its  fair  value  which  is  caused  by  the  fluctuation  of  interest  rate.  The  main 
instruments include the securities and derivatives that relate to interest rates.B. Interest risk management procedure of trading bookThe Bank prudently choose its investment target by studying the credibility and 
financial position of the securities issuers, their sovereign risk and the trend of 
interest rates. According to the operating strategy and the circumstances of the 
market,  the  Bank  sets  the  transaction  limit  and  stop-loss  limit  (including  the 
limits of dealing room, traders, and investment…etc.) of the trading book that 
are reported to the executive management or the board of directors for approval.C. Method of measurementa.  The assumption and calculation of VaR: see VaR section. 
b.  The Bank measures the investment portfolio’s interest risk exposure monthly.364Interest risk management of banking book 
 
The main objective of interest risk management of the banking book is to enhance 
the  interest  risk  management,  increase  the  operating  efficiency  of  the  fund  and 
strengthen the business operation.   
 
A. StrategyInterest risk management enhances the Bank’s ability take responsive actions to 
measure, to manage and avoid the risk that the fluctuation of interest rate may 
cause on the profit and the economic value of assets/liabilities.B. Management procedureWhen undertaking the operations relating to interest rate instruments, the Bank 
identifies  the  repricing  risk  of  interest  rate,  yield  curve  risk,  basis  risk  and 
options risk characteristics. In additional, the Bank also measures the potential 
impact of interest rate changes on the profit and economic value of the Bank. 
The  Bank  analyzes  and  monitors  the  interest  risk  limits  and  each  target  of 
interest  risk management  monthly. The results of analysis  and monitoring  are 
regularly reported to not only the risk management committee but also the board 
of directors. 
 
If any risk management targets is found to exceed the limit during the monitoring 
process,  it  will  be  reported  to  the  risk  management  committee  and  a  solution 
should be proposed.C. Method of measurementThe interest risk of the Bank mainly measures the repricing risk that is caused 
by  the  difference  between  maturity  date  and  repricing  date  of  the  assets, 
liabilities, and off balance sheet items in banking book. To stabilize long-term 
profitability and ensure business growth, the Bank sets the monitoring indicators 
of interest sensitivity in  major terms and implements stress test. Each interest 
risk  indicator  and  the  result  of  stress  test  are  reported  to  the  executive 
management regularly for review.Foreign exchange risk management 
 
A. Definition of foreign exchange riskForeign  exchange  risk  is  the  gain/loss  caused  by  two  currencies  exchange  at 
different  times.  The  Bank’s  foreign  exchange  risk  arises  from  the  derivative 
instruments,  such  as  spot  exchange,  forward  exchange  and  foreign  exchange 
option…etc. The Bank’s foreign exchange transactions are implemented daily 
to offset clients’ position. Thus, the Bank suffers little foreign exchange risk.365B. Policy,  procedure  and  measurement  methodology  of  foreign  exchange  riskmanagementIn order to control foreign exchange risk, the Bank sets the limits of transaction 
and stop-loss limits for the dealing room and traders. Meanwhile, the Bank also 
sets the maximum annual loss limit to control the loss within the tolerable extent. 
Foreign  exchange  risk  is  controlled  based  on  VaR.  The  assumption  and 
calculation of VaR is described in VaR section. 
 
For  foreign  exchange  risk,  the  Bank  sets  the  scenario  at  3%  fluctuation  of 
interest rate of major currencies to execute the stress test quarterly, and reports 
to the risk management committee.Risk management of equity securities price 
 
A. Definition of risk of equity securities priceThe market risk of equity securities held by the Bank includes the individual risk 
from  the  fluctuation  of  individual  equity  securities’  market  price  and  general 
market risk from the fluctuation of the overall price trend.B. Purpose of risk management in equity securities pricesTo avoid the massive fluctuation of equity securities price to worsen the Bank’s 
financial situation or earnings. Also, to raise the operating efficiency of capital 
and strengthen the business operation.C. Procedure of risk management of equity securities pricesThe Bank sets investment limit on industries, using the β value to measure the 
investment portfolio affected by the systemic risk monthly. The stop-loss point 
must be authorized by the board of directors, and the equity investment should 
be  authorized  by  the  executives  if  the  stop-loss  point  is  reached  but  the 
investment is not going to be disposed of.D. Measured methodologyThe risk of equity securities prices in trading book is mainly controlled by VaR. 
 
The Bank’s risk of equity securities prices from its non-trading portfolio should 
be control by each bank according to its own business scale to develop a stress 
test under appropriate scenarios and report to the risk management committee.366The  Bank  adopts  many  methodologies  to  manage  its  market  risk.  Value-at-
risk(VaR) is one of the methodologies. VaR is a statistical measure that assesses 
potential losses that might be caused by changes in risk factors over a specified 
period of time and at a specific level of statistical confidence. The Bank applies 
historical simulation with a statistic confidence of 99% to extrapolate the VaR 
of  one-year  fluctuations.  The  following  form  indicates  the  VaR  which  is  the 
estimation  of  potential  amount  of  loss  within  one  day.  While  the  statistic 
confidence of 99% represents the possible fluctuations that would be included 
in  assumed  adverse  market  changes.  Base  on  the  assumption,  the  VaR  may 
exceed the amounts listed in 1 of 100 days due to the price changes in the market. 
The overall VaR in the market may be less than the aggregate VaR of individual 
market risk factors.2017.12.31Factors of market risk  Average balanceInterest rate

-(7)  Credit riskCredit  risk  represents  the  risk  of  loss  that  the  Group  would  incur  if 
counterparty fails to perform its contractual obligations. 
 
To  centralize  risk  management  functions  currently  handled  by  different 
departments, the Bank’s board of directors resolved that a risk management 
department would be established to manage the credit risk. The objectives of 
a credit risk management are to improve asset quality and to generate stable 
profits while reducing risk through a diversified and balanced loan portfolio. 
The Bank’s board of directors sets the counterparty credit limits, which are 
then  implemented  by  the  credit  committee.  The  credit  committee  also 
monitors  current  and  potential  credit  exposure  to  individual  counterparties 
and  on  an  aggregate  basis  to  counterparties  and  their  affiliates.  The  Bank 
performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its lending portfolios to 
identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of those portfolios. 
 
The  Bank  maintains  a  strict  policy  to  evaluate  customers’  credit  ratings  when 
providing loan commitments and commercial letters of credit transactions. Certain 
customers are required to provide appropriate collateral for the related loans, and 
the  Bank  retains  the  legal  right  to  foreclose  on  or  liquidate  the  collateral.  The 
disclosure of the maximum credit exposure shall not take account of any collateral 
held or other enhancements. 
 
The  management  procedure  and  measurement  methodology  of  credit  risk  in  the 
Bank’s main business are as follows: 
 
Credit business (including the loan commitments and guarantees) 
 
The category of credit asset and the grade of credit quality were narrated as follow: 
 
A. Category of credit riskThe  credit  risk  of  the  Bank  was  classified  into  five  categories.  Normal  credit 
assets  shall  be  classified  as  “Category  One.”  The  remaining  unsound  credit 
assets shall be evaluated based on the status of the loan collaterals and the length 
of  time  overdue.  Assets  that  require  special  mention  shall  be  classified  as 
“Category  Two,”  assets  that  are  substandard  shall  be  classified  as  “Category 
Three,” assets that are doubtful shall be classified as “Category Four,” and assets 
for which there is loss shall be classified as “Category Five”. For managing the 
default credits, the Bank established the regulations governing the procedure to 
deal with non-performing loans, non-accrual loans and bad debts.370B. Grade of credit qualityThe Bank sets the level of credit quality based on the characteristics and scale 
of business (such as establishing the internal rating model of credit risk, setting 
the  credit  rating  table  or  relevant  rules  to  classify)  to  proceed  with  risk 
management.   
 
In order to measure the credit risk of the clients, the Bank employs the statistic 
methods and the professional judgment from the experts. The Bank develops the 
rating  model  of  business  credit  after  considering  the  clients’  relevant 
information. The model shall be reviewed periodically to verify if the calculated 
results conform to the reality and revise every parameter to optimize the results. 
 
With  respect  to  consumer  credit  assets  such  as  mortgages,  credit  cards,  and 
small-amount  credit  loans,  the  Bank  also  evaluates  default  risk  of  clients  by 
using  the  credit  rating  scores  developed  by  the  Bank  and  the  external  due 
diligence services. 
 
The credit quality of the Bank’s corporate borrowers is classified as excellent, 
good, and average. 
 
To  ensure  the  reasonable  estimated  values  of  credit  rating  system’s  design, 
process,  and  relevant  risk  factors,  the  Bank  executes  the  relevant  verification 
and  tests  the  model  according  to  the  actual  default  every  year  so  that  the 
calculated results will be close to actual default. 
 
Due from and call loans to other banks 
 
The  Bank  evaluates  the  counterparties’  credit  quality  before  transactions  and 
refers  to  the  domestic  and  foreign  credit  rating  agencies,  when  rendering 
different lines of credit based on the credit quality.C. Hedge of credit risk and easing policya.  CollateralThe Bank adopts a series of policies to lower the credit risk, and one of the 
frequently-used  methods  is  requesting  borrowers  to  provide  collaterals. To 
ensure the creditor’s rights, the Bank sets the scope available as collaterals 
and the procedures of appraising, managing, and disposing the collaterals. In 
addition, a credit contract is in place to provide the credit claim preservation, 
collaterals,  and  offset  provisions  to  stipulate  when  a  credit  trigger  event 
occurs, the Bank may reduce the limit, cut down the payback period, or deem 
all debts mature. Also, the Bank will use the deposits that the borrowers saved 
in the Bank to offset the liabilities to lower the credit risk. 
 
Other  non-credit  business  collaterals  shall  depend  on  the  characteristics  of 
the financial instruments. Only the asset-backed securities and other similar 
financial instruments are secured by an asset pool of financial instruments.371b.  Limit of credit risk and control of credit risk concentrationTo avoid the excessive risk concentration, the Bank limits the credit amounts 
of single counterparties and groups; the Bank also sets the investment guide 
and regulation of risk control of equity investment to restrict the investment 
limits of single person (company) or related company (group). Furthermore, 
the Bank establishes relevant regulations to control the concentration risk of 
assets, and sets the credit limits by industry, group, country, and stock types 
to monitor the credit concentration risk.c.  Net settlement agreementThe Bank usually settles by the gross balance, but signs contract with some 
counterparties  to  settle  by  net  balance.  If  a  default  happens,  the  Bank  will 
terminate all transactions with the counterparty and settle by net balance in 
order to lower the credit risk.D. The Bank’s maximum exposures to credit riskWithout  taking  into  account  the  collateral  or  other  credit  enhancement 
instrument,  the  maximum  credit  risk  exposure  of  on-balance-sheet  financial 
assets equals their carrying values. The maximum credit risk exposure of off-
balance-sheet  items  (without  considering  the  collaterals  or  other  credit 
enhancement is irrevocable) are as follows:

To  reduce  the  risk  from  any  businesses,  the  bank  conducts  an  overall 
assessment and takes appropriate risk reduction measures, such as obtaining 
collaterals  and  guarantors.  For  obtaining  of  collaterals,  the  Bank  has 
Collateral  Management  Guidelines,  to  ensure  that  collaterals  meet  the 
specific criteria and has the effect of reducing the business risk. 
 
The management deems the Group is able to control and minimize the credit 
risk exposures in off-balance-sheet items as the Group uses more strict rating 
procedures when extending credits and conduct reviews regularly.E. Credit concentration risk of the GroupWhen  the  counterparties  are  obviously  the  same  party,  or  there  are  several 
counterparties  but  engaging  in  similar  business  activities  and  sharing  similar 
economic characteristics, and vulnerable to the same economic impacts or other 
changes, the credit concentration risk is apparent. 
 
Credit concentration risk of the Group derives from the assets, liabilities and off-
balance-sheet  items,  and  arise  from  performing  obligations  or  engaging  in 
transactions or cross-line portfolio of risk exposures including credit extension, 
due from and call loans to other banks, securities investment, receivables and 
derivatives. The Group does not significantly concentrate on a single client or 
counterparty,  and  the  transaction  amount  with  a  single  client  or  counterparty 
accounted for the Bank’s total bills discounts and loans and overdue receivables 
is  not  significant.  Discounts  and  loans,  guarantees,  bills  purchased,  and 
acceptances receivable of the Group according to industry and country are listed

equivalents, due from the Central Bank and call loans to banks, financial assets 
at fair value through profit and loss, securities purchased under agreements to 
resell, refundable deposits, operating deposits and settlement fund, are excluded 
from  this analysis since  the counterparty is  normally with  good credit quality 
and is considered as low credit risk.

Aging analysis on past due but not impaired financial assets of the BankPast  due  but  not  impaired  loans  might  result  from  some  temporary 
administration reasons so the customers is in the early stages of delinquency 
but  no  actual  impairment  has  occurred  yet.  Unless  there  is  other  objective 
evidence shown otherwise, according to internal credit risk assets impairment 
evaluation  guideline,  a  loan  that  is  past  due  for  no  more  than  30  days  is 
typically not to be treated as impairment.2017.12.31ReceivablesCredit card business

meet  present  and  future  financial  obligations.  Liquidity  risk  is  also  managed  by 
ensuring that the excess of maturing liabilities over maturing assets in any period 
is kept to manageable levels relative to the amount of funds the Group believes it 
can generate within that period. As part of our liquidity risk management, the Group 
focuses  on  a  number  of  components,  including  tapping  available  sources  of 
liquidity,  preserving  necessary  funds  at  reasonable  cost  and  continuous 
contingency planning.

requirements and achieve the minimum adequacy ratio. The calculation of 
the eligible capital and regulatory capital should follow the rules issued by

of risk and execute risk management through capital allocation to realize 
optimization of resources.B. Capital management proceduresa.  The  Group  follows  the  guides  and  the  spirit  established  by  the  Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision, “The Banking Act of The Republic of

adequacy ratio at 8%, the minimum standard set by the competent authority. 
To implement capital management, the Group considers not only the business 
development  but  also  the  revised  regulation  from  the  competent  authority, 
significant fund operations and capital increase plans to evaluate the capital 
adequacy  ratio.  To  enhance  internal  monitoring  efficiency,  the  Bank 
established an early-warning mechanism to reduce the impact of significant 
events, to maintain the capital adequacy ratio and to ensure the integrity of 
the capital structures.c.  The  risk  management  team  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  regulatory 
capital of the Group. The regulatory capital is divided into net Tier 1 Capital 
and net Tier 2 Capital listed as follows:i.  Net Tier 1 Capital: The aggregate amount of net Common Equity Tier 1and net additional Tier 1 Capital.Net common equity tier 1 capital: Primarily consists of common equity minus 
intangible  assets  (including  goodwill),  unamortized  losses  on  sales  of  non-
performing loans, deferred tax assets due to losses from the previous year and 
other statutory adjustments. 
 
Net  additional  tier  1  capital:  Consists  of  the  aggregate  amount  of  non-
cumulative  perpetual  preferred  stocks  and  non-cumulative  perpetual 
subordinated debts, etc.ii.  Net  Tier  2  Capital:  Consists  of  cumulative  perpetual  preferred  stocks, 
increments,

capital  requirements  for  market  risk  and  operational  risk  multiplied  by 
12.5. Those assets already deducted from the regulatory capital, however, 
shall be deducted from the total risk-weighted assets.ii.  Risk-weighted Assets for Credit Risk: The measurement of the risk of loss 
caused by the counterparty’s default. This risk measurement is expressed 
as the total of each of the bank’s transaction items on and off the balance 
sheet times a risk weight.iii. The  Capital  Requirement  for  Market  Risk:  The  capital  required  for 
assessed losses from the bank’s transaction items on and off the balance 
sheet arising from movements in market prices (interest rates, exchange 
rates, and stock prices, etc.).iv. The  Capital  Requirement  for  Operational  Risk: The  capital  required  for 
the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal process, people 
and systems or external events.C. Regulatory capital ratioPursuant to of the Banking Act, the ratio of a bank’s eligible capital to its risk-
weighted assets must not be lower than a certain ratio; if such ratio is lower than 
the prescribed ratio, the Bank’s ability to distribute cash earnings or repurchase 
its shares may be restricted by the regulatory.
