Letter to ShareholdersI.ForewordDear Shareholders:The growth of the global economy stagnated throughout 2019 due to reducedmanufacturing activities, but expansionary monetary policies and interest rate cutsundertaken  by  key  central  banks  combined  with  phase  1  China-USA  tradesettlement provided a boost of market sentiment that pushed equity markets to newhighs. At the end of the year, Taiwan still managed to post strong growth figures asit benefited from the supply chain shift and back flow of capital, leading to highercorporate investments. However, given that global equity markets are at a relativelyhigh level and the uncertainties associated with phase 2 of the trade war, the ongoingpandemic,  slowdown  of  China's  growth  and  the  U.S.  election,  there  are  manyvariables that will affect global trade and investment, and Taiwan's growth prospect,in 2020.Despite the increasingly volatile economy and market competition worldwide,the Bank was still able to deliver strong earnings performance due to its extensiveindustry performance and the support of a highly efficient team. The Bank also wonseveral major awards during the year, including: [Global Finance] - The Best BanksIn  Taiwan,  [The  Asset]  -  Best  Service  Provider-E-Solutions  Partner,  StructuredProducts House of the Year - Taiwan, The Taiwan Project Finance House of the Year,[The  Asian  Banker]  -  Best  Digital  Transformation  Initiative,  Application  orProgramme in Taiwan 2019, Transaction Awards 2019 - Best Trade Finance Bankin  Taiwan,  The  6th  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  R.O.C.  National  IndustrialInnovation  Award  -  Team  Category  -  Innovative  Team  Leader,  and  FinancialSupervisory Commission Fair Customer Treatment Evaluation - Financial Industry- 1st Place. It is  evident that financial products and  services offered by the Bankhave been well-perceived by experts local and abroad.The  Bank  has  a  total  of  165  branches  deployed  throughout  Taiwan.  Withrespect  to  key  overseas  markets,  the  Bank  currently  operates  2  wholly  ownedsubsidiaries, 1 joint venture bank, 6 branches and 5 representative offices in total.As Cathay United Bank (China) Ltd. converted into a full-fledged subsidiary, theestablishment will be working closely with the Bank's Hong Kong Branch to growcross-border  services  and  develop  new  variety  of  RMB-denominated  financial1products.  As  for  the  Southeast  Asian  market,  the  Bank  has  already  establishedpresence in 9 of the 10 ASEAN countries, making it the Taiwanese bank with thebroadest service coverage in Southeast Asia. Through expansion of service network,integration of group resources and working with local strategic partners, the Bankaims to create a one-stop financial service platform to the benefit of more corporatecustomers, and take progressive steps toward becoming “Asia's leading bank.”In terms of innovation, the Bank adopts new financial technologies and dataanalyses and has fast and convenient digital service channels available to expandthe scope and value of services provided. Loan, credit card and insurance productshave been re-designed to accommodate the above, and the content of digital toolsand  services  is  constantly  improved  to  deliver  optimal  customer  experience  andenhance the breadth and depth of customer relations.After becoming the first bank in Taiwan to sign a commitment to the EquatorPrinciples,  Cathay  United  Bank  followed  up  with  a  voluntary  announcement  tocomply  with  UNEP  FI  “Principles  for  Responsible  Banking”  and  has  since  beenleading  financial  peers  in  social/environmental  awareness  and  green  bankingtransformation. Actions such as: project financing for local and foreign solar powerindustries,  establishment  of  solar-powered  branch,  financing  of  Taiwan's  firstoffshore  wind  power  development  etc.,  have  all  been  taken  to  fulfill  our  socialresponsibilities  as  a  financial  institution. We  envision  ourselves  of  becoming  themarket's leading brand in green banking, and shall continue to enforce our corporatesustainability  efforts  and  take  progressive  steps  toward  achieving  “sustainableenvironmental, social and economic developments.”The  Bank  perceives  talent  as  the  cornerstone  to  future  growth,  and  hascommitted efforts into creating a complete talent bank and training programs, forwhich  it  was  awarded  People  Development  Awards  of  Taiwan  CorporateSustainability Awards.  In the future, the Bank will continue integrating resourcesthroughout the financial group to build a stronger organization, and actively expandbusiness in size and scope under rigorous risk control and strict compliance withlocal as well as foreign laws to fulfill its long-term vision.2II.2019 business reportThe Bank had been able to maintain growth across all main business activitiesin 2019; key accomplishments are as follows:(I)Consumer banking serviceThe Bank continues to improve fundamental services to customers, and hasinvested extensively to connect physical and digital channels to deliver theultimate one-stop shopping experience of financial services.1.

Apartfrom total upgrade of credit card features, an innovative personal creditproduct called “Flexiloan” was also introduced that customers may drawand  repay  at  any  time,  with  interests  charged  only  if  drawn,  thereby5making it an ideal cash reserve facility. New functions such as foreigncurrency  digital  account  and  foreign  currency  rate  inquiry/exchangehave  made online account opening and foreign currency  trading fasterand more convenient to users, thereby enabling the mobile banking APPto deliver more complete financial service experience.4.

and overall business environment(I)External competitionThe China-USA trade conflict may have subsided following the phase1  agreement,  but  given  the  political  disturbance  in  many  countries  in  theworld,  recovery  of  global  trade  and  investment  remains  underwhelming.While the World Bank revised its global economic outlook downwards, theFed expected  a recovery  of economic activities. In the  meantime, centralbanks  of  China,  the  USA,  UK,  Japan  and  EU  have  all  announced  theirintention to inject additional liquidity into the market through expansionarypolicy.  The  spread  of  COVID-19  and  influenza,  too,  raises  concern  forbusiness confidence, as quarantine measures are starting to disrupt supplychain in many industries.Taiwan's economic outlook has been relatively favorable compared tothe  rest  of  the  world,  as  the  central  bank  concluded  in  its  latest  boardmeeting that impact of Phase 1 trade agreement between China and USAhad been limited, and that the government's support for building renewal,southern Taiwan development and national credit guarantee fund all havethe  potential  to  boost  domestic  demands.  However,  given  that  the  localbanking  industry  has  been  over-saturated  with  branches  for  a  prolongedperiod of time, it is important for banks to shift focus toward new businessesand avoid  the price competition  that is  happening on traditional services.The  Bank's  response  in  this  regard  is  to  continue  bringing  in  new  ideasthrough digital tools, providing full range of financial service to businesses,and enhancing control over credit exposure to cater for revenue quality andrisks at the same time.The wave of “digital revolution” has given rise to new technologiesand  digital  banking  service,  changed  the  conventional  banking  andmarketing practices, and fueled the growth of virtual channels to the extentthat physical branches are being forced to undergo transformation. Today,it  is  necessary  for  banks  to  invest  into  the  creation  of  an  online  bankingenvironment  and  to  guide  branches  toward  transformation,  while  at  thesame  time  cater  for  customers'  experience  and  transaction  security.Technologies have already changed the ways of the financial industry, anduprise  of  virtual  and  cloud-based  services  is  believed  to  disrupt  thecompetitive landscape even further, making FinTech companies the primarycompetitor.17As  globalization  and  automation  trends  emerge,  countries  in  theGreater  China  Region  and  Southeast  Asia  have  undertaken  furtherderegulations  in  an  attempt  to  attract  foreign  investors.  Despite  escalatedcompetition,  banks  in  general  should  be  able  to  take  advantage  of  thisdevelopment  now  that  new  business  opportunities  and  models  are  madepossible.  Newtechnologies  andservicesinspired  by  “digitaltransformation,” “smart service” and “process automation” bring faster andmore  drastic  changes  as  well  as  opportunities  and  challenges,  whichfinancial  service  providers  will  have  to  respond  with  more  pro-activeinvestment in digital banking solutions.(II)  The regulatory environmentThe Bank conducts security assessment of all computer systems usedin domestic and overseas offices, and makes the necessary improvementsto  enhance  security  and  conform  to  regulatory  requirements.  Anindependent consultant has been engaged to evaluate information securityfor the entire bank, and the outcome of evaluation, along with Statement ofInformation Security, are presented to the board of directors the followingyear. In addition, a digital learning platform is being used to train employeesand  promote  awareness  on  the  topic  of  information  security,  so  thatprotection  measures  can  be  enforced  more  thoroughly  as  part  of  thecorporate culture.The  Bank  has  internal  policies,  internal  control  measures,  trainingprograms and compliance self-assessment practices in place to address keyissues  such  as  fair  customer  treatment,  anti-money  laundering,  counterterrorism  financing,  corporate  social  responsibilities  etc.  for  compliancewith external regulations. Compliance awareness is being promoted to allemployees within the Bank, and all issues relevant to the Bank's operationsare covered by internal control and compliance systems.(III)  The overall business environmentPerformance  of  the  global  economy  in  2019  continued  to  beundermined by concerns toward the China-USA trade war, the slowdownin China's economic growth, and monetary policies and political/economicdistractions  in  the  EU  and  USA.  Global  trade  and  economic  growth  areexpected to slow down further as these uncertainties persist. While the Fedis firm on stimulating  growth with low interest rate and abundant  moneysupply, EU nations are still divided on which approach to take. Althoughcapital movement and trade activities remain frequent, businesses are faced18with  limited  room  for  profit  growth.  In  Taiwan,  investor  and  consumerconfidence  remain  weak  and  have  significantly  undermined  growthmomentum.The  Bank  will  strive  to  maintain  consistency  of  its  businessperformance, bring more complete financial services and account featuresto customers, secure deposit source, and optimize customer experience. TheBank also aims to develop integrated investment solutions for customers ofspecial needs, and take advantage of group synergy by cross-selling themthrough subsidiaries online as well as offline to attract new capital.VI.

Bank profileI.Date of establishmentJanuary 4, 1975II.  Bank historyThe United World Chinese Commercial Bank (UWCCB) and Cathay CommercialBank (CCB) was merged and renamed Cathay United Bank. UWCCB was found inSeptember  1971  during  the  4th  Cathay  Financial  Association  Gathering  whererepresentatives  of  Chinese  entrepreneurs  around  the  world  gave  their  determinedsupport  to  the  economy  of  their  motherland. A  total  of  17  national  and  regionaloverseas  Chinese  leaders  as  well  as  17  members  of  The  Bankers Association  ofTaipei provided 50% of the investment shares to establish UWCCB. In May 1974,the Conference of Sponsors was convened, creating a bank with an approved capitalsum  of  US$  12  million.  Shares  would  be  divided  into  equal  halves  to  domesticshareholders and overseas shareholders. In December 1974, the Ministry of Financesubmitted the relevant applications to the Executive Yuan, which then approved theestablishment of Cathay United Bank. UWCCB flagship office at No. 10, YongsuiStreet, Taipei City formally opened for business on 20 May 1975. Cathay UnitedBank  later  acquired  Huaqiao  Xintuo  Touzi  Gufen  Youxian  Gongsi  [OverseasChinese Trust and Investment Co., Ltd.] on 17 April 1995.Cathay Commercial Bank (CCB) was originally founded as the Diyi Xintuo TouziGufen Youxian Gongsi [First Trust and Investment Co., Ltd.] which established inJune 1971. The reelection of the entire board of directors and election of Chen-yuTsai as Chairperson of the Board in 1993 served as a turning point for this Company.Mr. Tsai  initiated  the  5-Year  Reformation  Program  and  successfully  renamed  theCompany  as  Huitong  Shangye  Yinhang  Gufen  Youxian  Gongsi  [HuitongCommercial Bank Co., Ltd.] on 16 November 1998. Cathay United Bank was laterrenamed as Cathay Commercial Bank (CCB) on 3 July 2002.We have initiated financial reformations in response to the government's FinancialHolding  Company  Act.  Since  Taiwan's  entry  to  the  World  Trade  Organization(WTO),  we  have  faced  intense  competition  from  multinational  financialconglomerates.  We  thus  provided  our  clients  with  improved  and  comprehensivefinancial  services.  Both  Cathay  Commercial  Bank  (CCB)  and  United  World20Chinese Commercial Bank (UWCCB) joined Cathay Financial Holdings Co., Ltd.in 22 April 2002 and 18 December 2002 respectively, becoming two wholly-ownedsubsidiary  banks  under  Cathay  Financial  Holdings.  To  maximize  the  combinedperformance of Cathay Financial Holding, we have implemented measures such asintegrating  the  resources  of  the  two  banks,  streamlining  operational  costs,improving  operational  efficiency,  and  expanded  our  services.  Both  UWCCB  andCCB have been merged in compliance with the Financial Institution Merger Act andother relevant laws. UWCCB would be the surviving company while CCB wouldbe dissolved in the merger. The merger contract and other associated issues wereresolved  and  passed  in  the  Board  of  Directors  meeting  on  21  April  2003  andapproved in 26 June by the Ministry of Finance. The reference date for the mergerwas 27 October 2003. The merged bank was renamed “Cathay United Bank Co.,Ltd.”To expand the scope of services provided and our market share, we then acquiredDiqi  Shangye Yinhang  [Seventh  Commercial  Bank]  on  1  January  2007.  Furthergrowth  was achieved  by  accepting  specific asset debt balances and operations  ofZhonglian  Xintuo  on  29  December  2007.  Since  these  acquisitions  and  mergers,Cathay  United  Bank  has  continued  to  expand  its  local  branch  offices  in Taiwan,becoming a private bank with the largest number (165) of branches .21Three.

Analysis of location of business, future market supply, demand and growth,and competition(1)  SupplyFollowing the authority's deregulation for online-only bank, customerswill be able to open deposit account, place time deposit, exchange currencyand  make  investments  entirely  online.  Although  digital  bank  services  dobring  convenience  to  customers,  they  pose  additional  competition  to  thefinancial industry.(2)  Demand and growthRepercussions of the  China-USA trade conflict will continue  to affect134future economic growth by a significant degree. International Monetary Fund(IMF) has already revised downward its global economic growth forecast for2020, and the outbreak of COVID-19 in the beginning of the year brings evenmore uncertainty to economic performance. For this reason, risk managementis currently the priority of the organization's investment management efforts.Meanwhile,  the  government's  annuity  reform  has  brought  the  public'sattention to retirement planning, and it is expected that consumers will looktoward  protection-oriented  products  and  bond-centric  portfolios  for  stableincome in periods of sustained low interest rate, and have greater demand fortotal asset allocation planning.(3)  Competitive advantageDue to saturation and high degree of homogeneity within the domesticfinancial market, it is necessary for banks to compete on financial innovationand  service  differentiation  in  the  future,  which  is  why  the  Bank  will  becooperating and integrating with partners from different industries to developinnovative practices that are different from traditional banking.With a vast customer base, financial technologies and big data analysisat disposal, the Bank is able to monitor market changes and customers' needs,and  quickly  satisfy  them  with  investment  and  insurance  products/serviceswith group support.While  market  uncertainty  remains  high,  the  Bank  will  focus  onenforcing  after-sale  and  risk  management  and  making  adjustments  tocustomers'  portfolio.  Doing  so  helps  build  a  professional  image  and  wincustomers' trust.The  Bank  possesses  exceptional  corporate  image  along  with  manyadvantages  including  a  vast  customer  base,  diverse  range  of  service,expansive business network, access to virtual channels, and support of groupresources that can be exploited for cross-selling synergy. All of which havethe potential to strengthen customer relations and improve overall satisfaction.The  Bank  actively  explores  expansion  opportunities  in  Greater  Chinaand  Southeast  Asian  markets  by  forming  relationship  with  local  andmultinational  businesses.  Cross-border  deployment  involves  long-termplanning and is an extension of the Bank's existing advantage. The purposeof such an expansion plan is generally to leverage the growth momentum ofthe target market and serve customers within the area.The Bank's overseas market expansion efforts have been largely focused135on  corporate  financing  and  related  products,  such  as:  syndicated  lending,trade  financing  and  cross-border  corporate  Internet  banking;  all  of  whichhave been well-received by local corporate customers. The same strategy isbeing applied in Greater China Region and ASEAN countries, as it creates astronger  relationship  with  the  local  market  that  would  benefit  the  Bank'soperating efficiency and profit performance over the long term.There have been signs of saturation in Taiwan's economic activities inrecent years; meanwhile, intensive competition among banks makes businessretention and expansion all the more difficult. However, the Bank possessesthe  advantage  to  compete  in  virtually  all  aspects  of  financial  service.  Itcurrently  leads  the  industry  in  wholesale  banking  and  consumer  bankingperformance, and will continue investing into its establishments in Taiwan tocreate the foundational support needed for overseas growth.2. Future opportunities, threats, and response strategies(1)  Opportunities, threats, and response strategies in Taiwan Opportunities① The Bank has a large customer base and is capable of applying financial 
technologies  to  analyze  customers'  needs.  Furthermore,  the  Bankoperates  an  extensive  branch  network  and  has  the  support  of  groupaffiliates to deliver suitable financial products and services to customersin a timely and localized manner.② 2019 had been a fruitful year for mobile payments, as annual transaction 
volume  surpassed  NT$100  billion  for  the  first  time,  achieving  above100%  growth  for  the  3rd  year  in  a  row.  The  result  shows  increasingacceptance for mobile payment solutions not only by consumers, but bychannels as well. With public and private sectors both advocating forcashless  payment,  the  Bank  expects  more  deregulations  in  the  futurethat will help new payments prosper even further.③ The Bank currently operates 165 branches domestically. This coverage 
enables it to build relationship and offer full range of financial servicesto  local  customers  and  related  parties  for  additional  revenues  andmutual benefits.④ The  size  of  the  credit  card  market  continues  to  grow  as  consumers 
become  accustomed  to  using  plastic  currency  and  mobile  payment  indaily activities. This shift in habit not only brings banks, merchants and136consumers closer, but also provides abundant supply of valuable datathat  can  be  analyzed  to  achieve  precision  marketing  and  satisfycustomers' needs in a more timely manner.⑤ Combining  digital  technology  with  banking  opens  up  tremendous 
opportunities,  whereas  the  addition  of  small  loan  platform  makesapplication and information easily accessible, and further expansion ofthe online insurance platform provides customers with streamlined andmore satisfactory digital banking service experience.⑥ Research  institutions  are  generally  conservative  about  the  short-term 
and  medium-term  outlook  of  the  global  economy  and  expect  lowergrowth rate in 2020 for a number of reasons including the low-interestenvironment, the China-USA trade war, China's economic slowdown,and stagnation of advanced economies (such as EU). Businesses havealso  grown  conservative  toward  borrowing  and  investment,  but  theconservatism  is  somewhat  mitigated  by  the  trade  war  as  Taiwaneseenterprises return with demands for borrowing and capital investment.The  banking  industry  continues  to  monitor  credit  risks  and  industrychanges, and aims to improve business performance by shifting focustoward asset quality and service diversity. Threats① Some banks are offering high credit card rewards and privileges in an 
attempt  to  expand  market  share;  as  a  result,  competition  has  grownintense to the point that the Bank is required to work harder to maintainmarket share and cardholder service, which undermines profitability.② Controls over automated channels have tightened, and it is increasingly 
difficult to maintain system usability and improve performance at thesame time.③ Banks  are  undertaking  their  own  channel  integrations  and  creating 
proprietary payment ecosystems that, with the addition of online-onlybanks,  intensifies  competition  even  further.  Being  able  to  establishcollaborative  relationship  with  key  merchants  and  build  up  visibilityand user habit amidst competition will be the key to sustainable success.④ The addition of financial technology service providers and online-only 
industry  has  made  financial  servicesthe  bankingbanksintohomogeneous  across  industry  participants.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the137financial  industry  will  continue  facing  challenge  from  new  serviceproviders in the future.⑤ The authority has tightened control and supervision over product sales 
to  the  point  that  impacts  business  development  and  increasescompliance  cost.  One  of  the  challenges  faced  by  the  Bank  is  to  findways to grow business and revenues while catering for business risk andcompliance.⑥ It is difficult for banks to enjoy excess profit margins due to saturation 
of  the  domestic  financial  market  and  the  prevailing  low-interestenvironment.  Furthermore,  given  the  rapid  changes  in  financialproducts and the banking environment, banks have to constantly adjustand adapt, which presents major challenges to future operations.⑦ As  domestic  interest  rates  remain  low,  growth  potential  of  wealth 
management service is somewhat limited. Furthermore, customers' shifttoward  digital  transactions  takes  margin  away  from  conventionalservice and detracts overall business performance. Response measures① Place  greater  emphasis  on  analyzing  big  data  as  a  means  to  monitor 
customers'  spending  pattern  and  preference;  introduce  flexible  andpersonalized  products  and  campaigns  to  strengthen  relationship  withcardholders and increase marketing yield as a result.② Associate  products  and  services  with  lifestyle  scenarios  for  enhanced 
competitiveness; offer differentiated and innovative financial servicesthat  aim  to  satisfy  customers'  diverse  needs  anytime,  anywhere,  andavoid engaging peers in price competition.③ Develop  strategic  relationship  with  key  channel  partners  and  make 
financial products more readily available; improve user experience andexplore  collaborative  opportunitiesto  expand  financial  servicescenarios  further;  strengthen  attachment  of  existing  users  and  attractnew customers.④ Value  customers'  needs  and  shift  service  emphasis  from  profits  and 
savings  to  investment  planning  at  various  stages  in  customers'  life;direct attention toward after-sale management and exercise sound riskcontrol.⑤ Leverage expertise of the financial advisory team and offer customized138solutions  from  investment,  wealth  transfer  to  taxation  that  meet  theexpectation  of  high  net  worth  customers;  for  young  and  tech-savvycustomers,  introduce  new  functions  such  as  smart  investment,  onlineinteractive  platform  and  investment/trading  over  Internet  banking  fortotal relationship management.⑥ Improve user friendliness and information content of the online trading 
platform through Fintech; integrate investment and insurance advisoryservices and adjust sales approach according to changes in the economy,regulations  and  customers'  needs;  escalate  service  transformation  todeliver win-win solutions for the Bank and its customers.⑦ Integrating  across  devices,  platforms  and  physical/virtual  channels, 
accountprovide  digitalenhanceandcashflowservicecollection/payment functions to become the customers' primary banker.⑧ Make optimal use of existing customer base and physical channels, and 
intensify intra-group business referral in ways that improve the depthand breadth of relationship with top customers.⑨ New  financial  products  continue  to  be  introduced  at  a  fast  rate.  With 
online-only banks scheduled to commence business in 2020, banks arecompelled by changes in the business environment to adopt digital andmore flexible solutions. The financial industry  remains desperately inneed  of  competent  talents,  which  is  why  the  Bank  will  continueimproving its training system and aim to build a workforce of adequatequality,  quantity  and  professional  characters  to  support  corporatebanking growth.(2)  Opportunities, threats, and response strategies in overseas markets OpportunitiesThe Bank's target markets still presents significant business opportunitiesgiven their strong growth potentials and favorable conditions. ThreatsSupervisory standards have tightened around the world, increasing overallcompliance cost. Response measures① China and ASEAN countries have attracted the attention of businesses139around the world not only for their 6% average GDP growth, but alsofor their population dividend and enormous domestic demand. In lightof the fact that many Taiwanese enterprises have already tapped into thelocal industry chain and are desperately in need of financial service, theBank  responded  with  action,  coordinating  its  China  subsidiary,Cambodian  subsidiary  and  branches  throughout  ASEAN  to  executelocalized strategies with full product, marketing and risk managementsupport from the Head Office, so that customers may access the sameservices  in  the  home  country  as  they  would  abroad.  Interest  rates  inChina  and  ASEAN  countries  are  still  relatively  high  compared  toTaiwan,  Japan,  Europe  and  America,  which  offer  higher  spread  forlending  businesses.  Involvement  in  these  emerging  markets  can  berewarded  with  growth  in  terms  of  both  business  volume  and  profitmargin, subject to proper risk control.② The  Bank  foresees  its  corporate  banking  and  consumer  banking 
activities to be largely in line with existing trends such as technology,environmental protection and green energy. Big data-driven customerservice,  smart  investment  service,  process  automation  and  financingprojects that conform to Equator Principles are some of the areas thatthe Bank will be committing resources into to better satisfy customers'needs.  Internally,  a  “Digital  Transformation  Program”  has  been,  andwill  be  continuouslyimplementedto  help  employees  expandprofessional capacity  while at the same time identify potential talentsthat play a key role in the Bank's long-term competitiveness.(V)  Research and development of new financial instruments1.

(Analysis is not required for changes of less than 20%)Standalone1.  [Asset growth rate] increased: Mainly attributed to a 63% increase in the growth rate of “Security and derivative investments” at the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018.2.  [Profit growth rate] decreased: Mainly attributed to a NT$1.4 billion reduction in the variation of “Gain or loss on exchange” in 2019 compared to 2018.3.  [Cash flow ratio], [cash flow adequacy ratio] and [cash flow coverage ratio] decreased: Due to decreased net cash flow from operating activities in 2019.Consolidated:1.  [Cash flow ratio], [cash flow adequacy ratio] and [cash flow coverage ratio] decreased: Due to decreased net cash flow from operating activities in 2019.(Note): Net cash flow from investing activities was negative, hence not calculated.* Companies that prepare standalone financial statements are also required to provide financial analysis on a standalone basis.* Companies that prepare IFRS-compliant financial information for less than 5 years are also required to complete Table (2) below and report financial information using financial accounting standards ofthe R.O.C.Note 1:  Data from 2015 to 2019 have been audited and certified by the independent auditors.Note 2:  Formulas of various analyses are defined below:1.  Operational ability(1)  Deposit to loan ratio = total loan / total deposit 
(2)  NPL ratio = total non-performing loan / total loan 
(3)  Interest expense as a % of yearly average deposit balance = total interest expense on deposits / yearly average deposit balance 
(4)  Interest revenue as a % of yearly average credit balance = total interest revenue from credit / yearly average credit balance 
(5)  Total assets turnover = net income/average total assets 
(6)  Revenues per employee (Note 7) = net income / total employees 
(7)  Average earnings per employee = net profit after tax / total number of employees2.  Profitability(1)  Return on tier 1 capital =net profit before tax / average tier 1 capital. 
(2)  Return on assets = net profit after tax/ average total assets. 
(3)  Return on equity = net profit after tax / average shareholders' equity. 
(4)  Net profit margin = net profit after tax/net income 
(5)  Earnings per share (EPS) = (attributable to shareholders’ equity of the parent – preferred stock dividends) / weighed average quantity of outstanding shares. (Note 5)1683.  Financial structure(1)  Debt to asset ratio = total liabilities / total assets. 
(2)  Property, plant, and equipment to equity ratio = net property, plant and equipment / shareholders' equity.4.  Growth rate (%)(1)  Asset growth rate = (total assets in current period – total assets in previous period) / total assets in previous period. 
(2)  Profitability growth rate = (net profit before tax in current period – net profit before tax in previous period) / net profit before tax in previous period5.  Cash flows (Note 8)(1)  Cash flow ratio = net cash flow from operating activities / (interbank borrowing and overdraft + commercial papers payable + financial liability at fair value through profit or loss+ Notesand bonds issued under repurchase agreements + accruals payable within one year).(2)  Net cash flow adequacy ratio = net cash flows from operating activities in the last 5 years / (capital expenditure + cash dividend) in the last 5 years. 
(3)  Cash flow coverage ratio = net cash flow from operating activities / net cash flow from investing activities.6.  Liquidity reserve ratio = liquid assets mandated by The Central Bank / mandatory liquidity reserves. 
7.  Scale of operation(1)  Market share of assets = total assets / total assets of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activities (Note 6) 
(2)  Market share of net worth = net worth / total net worth of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activities 
(3)  Market share of deposits = total deposit / total deposit of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activities 
(4)  Market share of loans = total loan / total loan of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activitiesNote 3:  Total liabilities are net of provisions for guarantees and accidental losses.Note 4:  Attention to the following is required when the aforementioned equations for the calculation of EPS are applied to assessment:1.  The weighted average quantity of outstanding common shares shall be used as the standard, not the quantity of outstanding shares at the end of the year. 
2.  In case of raising capital through issuing new shares or transactions of treasury stocks, calculate also the weighted average quantity of outstanding shares in the period of circulation. 
3.  In case of capitalization of retained earnings or capitalization of capital surplus into new shares, adjustment shall be made in retrospect to the size of capitalization for each instance whencalculating the earnings per shares annually or semi-annually. The time of issuance can be neglected.4.  If the preferred shares are non-convertible accumulated preferred shares, the dividend declared in current period (whether paid or unpaid) shall be deducted from corporate earnings or asaddition to earnings after taxation.5.  If the    preferred shares are not accumulative in nature, dividend for preferred shares shall be deducted from net profit after tax, if any. In case of loss, no adjustment shall be made.Note 5:  Financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan-related activities include local banks, Taiwanese branches of Mainland banks, Taiwanese branches of foreign banks, credit cooperativeassociations, and credit departments of farmers/fishermen associations.Note 6:  Revenue refers to the sum of interest and non-interest revenues.Note 7:  The cash flow analysis takes into account the following:1.  Net cash flow from operating activities is taken from the amount of net cash flow from operating activities presented in the cash flow statement. 
2.  Capital expenditure refers to the amount of annual cash outflow for capital investments. 
3.  Cash dividends include cash dividends to both common shares and preferred shares. 
4.  Gross property, plant, and equipment refers to the amount before deducting accumulated depreciation.169Analysis ItemCapitalCapital adequacy ratioUnit:  NT$  thousandYear20192018201720162015Capital adequacy ratio for the most recent yearConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneCommon share equity193,317,039186,226,591173,805,139166,969,563151,860,690149,392,107145,012,403142,855,418139,878,041137,882,930Tier 1 non-common share equity33,059,26127,099,09334,304,20628,371,34333,690,07331,871,91720,424,62018,882,42520,879,20319,364,361Tier 2 capitalCapital61,447,60648,554,79764,789,65951,801,63868,268,77664,210,86855,891,56652,872,41260,968,54357,726,827287,823,906261,880,481272,899,004247,142,544253,819,539245,474,892221,328,589214,610,255221,725,787214,974,118Standardized approach1,546,548,3471,458,022,8911,525,409,8361,445,220,0931,373,772,0641,315,254,8311,390,674,2521,333,208,6751,182,259,5771,135,664,668Credit RiskInternal ratings based approach----------Asset securitizationBasic indicator approachRisk weighted

[Standard approach] increased: Mainly attributed to the adoption of simplified approach for options and an increase in the risk exposure of equity securities compared to the previous year.1.  All financial information from 2015 to 2019 has been verified by CPA. 
2.  Capital, risk-weighted assets and total risk exposure shown in this table have been calculated according to “Regulations Governing the Capital Adequacy and Capital Category of Banks” and“Calculation Explanation and Form for Bank Regulatory Capital and Risk-Weighted Assets.”3.  Below are the formulas used for the calculations in this table:(1)  Capital = common share equity + Tier 1 non-common share equity + Tier 2 capital. 
(2)  Total risk weighted assets = credit risk weighted assets + required capital for (operational risk + market risk) × 12.5. 
(3)  Capital adequacy ratio = capital / total risk weighted assets. 
(4)  Tier 1 capital as a % of risk-weighted assets = (common share equity + other tier 1 capital that is not common share equity) / total risk-weighted assets. 
(5)  Common share equity as a % of risk-weighted assets = common share equity / total risk-weighted assets. 
(6)  Leverage ratio = net tier 1 capital / total risk exposure.4.

system 
among 
departments.  The  Bank  develops  organization-wide 
risk  management  culture  and  incorporates  it  into 
daily  operations.  Through  dynamic  analysis,  the 
Bank  constantly  assesses  risks  and  undertakes 
response  measures  to  optimize  asset  quality  while 
ensuring the integrity of its capital structure.(4) Procedures: The Bank complies with business-related 
andimplementationregulationsrules,and176ItemDetailsimplements levels of approval authority to assess and 
review  incoming  cases  for  rigorous  control  of  asset 
quality  prior  to  lending.  Through  credit  review  and 
credit reporting, the Bank monitors credit conduct of 
its borrowers or counterparties over the period of loan 
or investment, and undertakes response  measures at 
times  deemed  appropriate.  Debt  security  measures 
are undertaken as soon as possible in the event of the 
borrower's or counterparty's default/overdue.The board of directors is the ultimate decision maker for 
the Bank's credit risk strategies and major risk policies. 
The Bank has independent and specialized departments 
and functional teams to oversee management, planning, 
execution  and  control  of  credit  risks  associated  with 
credit, investment and financial products. 
The credit risk reporting and assessment system covers 
credit  approval  procedures,  limit  management,  credit 
rating, collateral information, regular credit review, and 
NPL  management.  In  addition  to  making  ongoing 
improvements  to  risk  quantification  technologies  and 
risk assessment models, the Bank also refines its stress 
testing methodology for better control of asset quality, 
and takes precautionary measures as deemed necessary. 
Borrowers and counterparties are regularly analyzed for 
credit  risk  exposure  and  severity  of  losses  in  order  to 
determine  appropriate  measures  for  risk  avoidance  or 
mitigation,  including:  rejection  of  service,  conditional 
service, collateral or credit guarantee. With the help of 
systems  such  as  interim  credit  review  and  collateral 
management,  the  Bank  is  able  to  monitor  all  types  of 
mitigation tools used in business.2. Credit risk managementframework and organization3. Scope and features of credit

framework  and  systems  in  place  to  manage  banking 
operations,  improve  efficiency,  reduce  risk  exposure,  and 
secure assets. 
Apart  from  converting  operational  risk  strategies  into 
feasible  policies  and  procedures,  the  Bank  also  conducts 
operational  risk  self-assessment,  reports  operational  risk 
incidents,  and  uses  key  risk  indicators  to  help  identify, 
assess, and monitor risks: 
(1) Operational  risk  self-assessment:  To  identify  risks 
associated  with  operational  activities  as  well  as  the 
underlying  cause,  control  methods  and  risk  exposure, 
and thereby enable response plans.(2) Operational  risk  incident  reporting:  The  reporting 
process  is  triggered  whenever  an  operational  risk 
incident  occurs,  so  that  the  underlying  cause  can  be 
identified, assessed, and discussed for improvement.(3) Key risk indicators: Develop indicators for the potential

database,  and  regularly  enforces  its  operational  risk  self-
assessment  and  key  risk  indicators.  Operational  risk  self-
assessments and key risk indicators are used to classify risk 
exposures  into  high,  medium  and  low  level.  Response 
measures have been devised for the different levels of risk 
identified  to  enable  effective  monitoring  and  improve 
operational  risk  exposure.  The  operational  risk  event 
database  is  tracked,  analyzed  and  reported  regularly; 
procedure and system optimizations are proposed based on 
the analysis report. 
The Bank conducts risk self-assessment prior to launching 
new financial products (including new business categories, 
products and service models). Depending on the extent and 
frequency  of  risk  impact,  the  Bank  uses  insurance  and 
engages  external  parties  to  mitigate  or  transfer  potential 
exposures. The Bank has business continuity policies and 
rules in place to address risk events that are likely to cause 
disruption  to  business  operations.  Drills  are  conducted 
from time to time to minimize possible losses and improve

the strategic planning and supervision of liquidity risk management 
within the Bank. Routine funding and trading are executed by the 
Treasury  Department.  Factors  that  have  an  adverse  effect  on 
liquidity are to be analyzed and addressed with involvement from 
the  Finance  and  Accounting  Department  and  the  Treasury 
Department in order to mitigate liquidity risk impacts.(2) The  Bank  has  a  set  of  “Liquidity  Risk  Management  Guidelines”

support business risk management by maintaining solvency.(1) Scope  of  liquidity  risk  assessment  may  include:  highly  liquid 
assets,  funding  diversity  and  stability,  balance  sheet  indicators, 
other liquidity factors and liquidity stress tests.(2) The Bank manages liquidity risk by preparing “Liquidity Reserve 
Requirement Report,” “Maturity Analysis Report,” “Liquidity Gap 
Analysis  Report,”  “Liquidity  Coverage  Ratio  Report”  and  “Net 
Stable Funding Ratio Report” on a regular basis. These reports are 
used  to  monitor  liquidity  indicators  and  ensure  that  figures  are 
within limit.(3) In addition to monitoring liquidity risk through monthly reports, the 
Bank  also  conducts  quarterly  liquidity  stress  tests  as  means  to 
assess its debt servicing capabilities. Outcomes are reported to the 
board of directors every six months.(1) Deposit  concentration  is  examined  regularly  and  “NTD  Maturity 
Analysis  Report”  is  prepared  on  a  monthly  basis.  A  “Foreign 
Currency  Liquidity  Gap  Analysis”  is  prepared  for  any  foreign 
currency  that  accounts  for  more  than  5%  of  total  liability.  This 
report  monitors  negative  gap  in  foreign  currency  assets  and 
liabilities  relative  to  total  foreign  currency  assets,  and  provides 
decision  makers  with  an  indication  of  how  to  diversify  capital 
source and maturity.(2) Overseas  branches  are  required  to  devise  capital  plans  based  on 
asset/liability allocation and outcomes of liquidity and interest rate 
sensitivity analysis. Sourcing and use of capital shall comply with 
rules  of  the  local  authority  and  take  into  account  factors  such  as 
safety  and  revenue  potentials.  Any  mismatch  in  the  maturity  of 
assets and liabilities also have to be properly managed. Branches 
are required to discuss capital plans with the Head Office so that 
funding  can  be  arranged  on  a  bank-wide  basis.  Any  change  in 
asset/liability allocation that requires an adjustment to the capital 
plan  will  have  to  be  discussed  with  the  Head  Office  before 
proceeding.194Item5. Liquidity risk

and  Management  Guidelines”  to  prevent  solvency  and  liquidity 
crises  that  may  arise  in  relation  to  occurrences  such  as  abnormal 
deposit withdrawal, substantial loss of capital or liquidity shortage. 
The Guidelines not only ensure timely and effective crisis handling, 
but also mitigate impact from major or sudden occurrences to the 
protection  of  deposit  holders,  investors,  traders  and  market 
discipline.(2) The  Asset  and  Liability  Management  Committee  convened 
meetings  to  devise  responses  whenever  liquidity  reserve  falls 
below a certain level.The Bank performs stress tests on liquidity risk at least on a quarterly 
basis to assess the Bank's debt-serving capacity should a liquidity crisis 
occur. Results of the stress test are reported to the board of directors

The Board of Directors and Stockholder 
Cathay United Bank Co., Ltd. 
 
Opinion 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Cathay United Bank Co., 
Ltd. (the “Bank”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”), which comprise the 
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019, and the consolidated statements of 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies 
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). 
 
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019, its 
consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in 
accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Public Banks, 
Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Firms, and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International Accounting Standards (IAS), IFRIC 
Interpretations (IFRIC), and SIC Interpretations (SIC) endorsed and issued into effect by the 
Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic of China. 
 
Basis for Opinion 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Regulations Governing Auditing and Attestation of 
Financial Statements by Certified Public Accountants and auditing standards generally accepted in 
the Republic of China. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with The Norm of Professional Ethics for 
Certified Public Accountant of the Republic of China, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
 
Key Audit Matters 
 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters.243Key audit matters for the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
December 31, 2019 are as follows: 
 
Impairment Assessment on Loans 
 
The domestic loans of the Bank amounted to $1,399,537,914 thousand was considered material to 
the financial statements as a whole. As the assessment of impairment of loans involves accounting 
estimates and management’s significant judgment, and as the impairment assessment on loans 
under the relevant regulations issued by the authorities is substantially larger than that under IFRS 
9, hence, we determined the impairment of the loans under the relevant regulations prescribed by 
the authorities as a key audit matter. 
 
Its management regularly assesses the impairment on its loans. Recognition of impairment loss on 
loans is based on compliance with regulations issued by the authorities regarding the classification 
of credit assets and provision of impairment loss. For the accounting policies and relevant 
information on the impairment assessment of loans, refer to Notes 4, 5 and 14. 
 
The main audit procedures we performed in response to the key audit matter described above are as 
follows: 
 
1.  We understood and tested its internal controls of impairment assessment on loans. 
 
2.  We tested the classification of the credit assets into their respective categories out of the totalfive categories to see if it complies with the relevant regulations issued by the authorities.3.  We performed the test on selected samples to ensure the appropriateness of impairment by thelength of the overdue period and the value of the collateral of each respective loan.4.  We calculated the provision of impairment loss by classifying the credit assets into theirrespective category to see if it complies with the relevant regulations issued by the authorities.Other Matter 
 
We have also audited the separate financial statements of the Bank as of and for the year ended 
December 31, 2019 on which we have issued an unmodified opinion. 
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 
2018 were audited by other auditors who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on 
March 21, 2019. 
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the ConsolidatedFinancial StatementsManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by 
Public Banks, Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Firms, and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International Accounting Standards (IAS), 
IFRIC Interpretations (IFRIC), and SIC Interpretations (SIC) endorsed and issued into effect by the 
Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic of China, and for such internal control as 
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.244In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to 
liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
Those charged with governance, including the supervisors, are responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process. 
 
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards 
generally accepted in the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. 
 
As part of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of 
China, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also: 
 
1.  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.2.  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design auditprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.3.  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accountingestimates and related disclosures made by management.4.  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accountingand, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to 
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.5.  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.6.  Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entitiesor business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the group 
audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.245We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit. 
 
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended December 31, 2019 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our 
auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication. 
 
The engagement partners on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report are Li-Chi Chen 
and Shiuh-Ran Cheng.

Cathay United Bank Co., Ltd. (“the Bank”), originally named United World Chinese Commercial Bank 
(“UWCCB”), was established in December 1974 after obtaining approval from the Ministry of Finance, 
Republic  of  China  (“ROC”)  and  officially  started  operations  on  May  20,  1975.  The  Bank  is  mainly 
engaged  in  the  following  operations:  (1)  all  commercial  banking  operations  authorized  by  the  ROC 
Banking Act (“Banking Act”); (2) international banking business and related operations; (3) trust business; 
(4) off-shore banking business; and (5) other financial operations related to the promotion of investments 
by overseas Chinese. The Bank’s registered office and main business location is at No. 7, Songren Rd., 
Xinyi District, Taipei City, Republic of China (ROC). 
 
The Bank’s stock was originally trading on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (the “TWSE”) until December 
18, 2002, where it was delisted after becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cathay Financial Holding 
Co.,  Ltd.  (“Cathay  Financial  Holdings”)  on  the  same  date  through  a  share  swap.  Under  the  Financial 
Institutions  Merger  Act, the  Bank  merged  with the  former  Cathay  Commercial Bank,  a  wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Cathay Financial Holdings on October 27, 2003, with UWCCB as the surviving entity and 
was renamed Cathay United Bank Co., Ltd. 
 
The  Bank  merged  with  Lucky  Bank  on  January  1,  2007.  The  Bank  was  the  surviving  entity  after  this 
merger  and  Lucky  Bank  was  the  extinguished  entity.  In  addition,  the  Bank  acquired  specific  assets, 
liabilities, and business of China United Trust & Investment Corporation (“CUTIC”) on December 29, 
2007. 
 
Cathay Financial Holdings is the Bank’s parent company and ultimate parent company.2.  APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe consolidated financial statements of the Bank and its subsidiaries (“the Company”) were approved by 
the Bank’s board of directors and authorized for issue on March 11, 2020.3.  APPLICATION OF NEW, AMENDED AND REVISED STANDARDS ANDINTERPRETATIONSa.  Initial application of the amendments to the Regulations Governing the Preparation of 
Financial Reports by Public Banks and the International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS), International Accounting Standards (IAS), Interpretations of IFRS (IFRIC), and 
Interpretations of IAS (SIC) (collectively, the “IFRSs”) endorsed and issued into effect by 
the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)Except for the following, the initial application of the amendments to the Regulations Governing the 
Preparation of Financial Reports by Public Banks and the IFRSs endorsed and issued into effect by 
the FSC did not have material impact on the Company’s accounting policies: 
 
IFRS 16 “Leases” 
 
IFRS 16 provides a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and their 
treatment  in  the  financial  statements  of  both  lessee  and  lessor.  It  supersedes  IAS  17  “Leases”, 
IFRIC  4  “Determining  whether  an  Arrangement  contains  a  Lease”,  and  a  number  of  related 
interpretations. Refer to Note 4 for information relating to the relevant accounting policies.254Definition of a lease 
 
The Company elected to apply the guidance of IFRS 16 in determining whether contracts are, or 
contain, a lease only to contracts entered into (or changed) on or after January 1, 2019. Contracts 
identified as containing a lease under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 are not reassessed and are accounted 
for in accordance with the transitional provisions under IFRS 16. 
 
The Company as lessee 
 
The Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases on the balance sheets 
except for those whose payments under low-value asset and short-term leases are recognized as 
expenses  on  a  straight-line  basis.  On  the  statements  of  comprehensive  income,  the  Company 
presents  the  depreciation  expense  charged  on  right-of-use  assets  separately  from  the  interest 
expense accrued on lease liabilities; interest is computed using the effective interest method. On 
the  statements  of  cash  flows,  cash  payments  for  the  principal  portion  of  lease  liabilities  are 
classified within financing activities; cash payments for the interest portion are classified within 
operating activities. Prior to the application of IFRS 16, payments under operating lease contracts, 
were  recognized  as  expenses  on  a  straight-line  basis.  Cash  flows  for  operating  leases  were 
classified within operating activities on the statements of cash flows.   
 
Lease liabilities were recognized on January 1, 2019 for leases currently classified as operating 
leases under IAS 17. Lease liabilities will be measured at the present value of the remaining lease 
payments, discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate on January 1, 2019. Right-of-
use assets will be measured at an amount equal to the lease liabilities, adjusted by the amount of 
any prepaid or accrued lease payments. Except for the following practical expedients which are 
applied, the Company applies IAS 36 to all right-of-use assets. 
 
The Company expects to apply the following practical expedients: 
 
1)  The Company also applies a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases withreasonably similar characteristics to measure lease liabilities.2)  The Company accounts for those leases for which the lease term ends on or beforeDecember 31, 2019 as short-term leases.3)  The Company excludes initial direct costs from the measurement of right-of-useassets on January 1, 2019.4)  The Company uses hindsight, such as in determining lease terms, to measure leaseliabilities.The lessee’s weighted-average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities recognized 
on January 1, 2019 is 0.89%. The difference between the (i) lease liabilities recognized and (ii) 
operating  lease  commitments  disclosed  under  IAS  17  on  December  31,  2018  is  explained  as

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Regulations Governing 
the Preparation of Financial Reports by Public Banks, Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial 
Reports  by  Securities  Firms  and  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS),  International 
Accounting  Standards  (IAS),  Interpretations  of  IFRS  (IFRIC),  and  Interpretations  of  IAS  (SIC) 
(collectively, the “IFRSs”) endorsed and issued into effect by the FSC. Disclosure information included 
in the consolidated  financial statements  is  less  than that required in a  complete set  of  annual  financial 
statements. 
 
Basis of Preparation 
 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial 
instruments and investment property which are measured at fair value. 
 
The fair value measurements are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value 
measurement inputs are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its 
entirety, which are described as follows:a.  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets orliabilities;b.  Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that areobservable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived 
from prices); andc.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.Basis of ConsolidationPrinciples for preparing consolidated financial statements 
 
The  consolidated financial statements  incorporate  the financial  statements of  the Bank  and the  entities 
controlled by the Bank (Indovina Bank, CUBC Bank and CUBCN Bank).257The accounting policies of the consolidated entities are same.   
 
All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full upon consolidation. 
Total  comprehensive  income  of  subsidiaries  is  attributed  to  the  owners  of  the  Bank  and  to  the  non-
controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. 
 
Changes in the Company’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Company losing 
control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the interests 
of  the  Company  and  the  non-controlling  interests  are  adjusted  to  reflect  the  changes  in  their  relative 
interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests 
are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and 
attributed to the owners of the Bank. 
 
The  Bank’s  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  Head  Office,  all  branches,  and  OBU,  in 
addition  to  the  subsidiaries  accounts.  All  intercompany  transactions  and  accounts  balances  have  been 
eliminated for consolidation purposes. 
 
Entities included in consolidated financial statements 
 
See  Note  16  for  detailed  information  on  subsidiaries  (including  percentages  of  ownership  and  main 
businesses). 
 
Foreign Currencies 
 
In preparing the financial statements of each entity in the group, transactions in currencies other than the 
entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the 
dates of the transactions. 
 
At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the  rates  prevailing  at  that  date.  Exchange  differences  on  monetary  items  arising  from  settlement  or 
translation  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  in  the  period  in  which  they  arise  except  for:  Exchange 
differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is 
neither planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation), 
which are recognized initially in other comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss 
on disposal of the net investments.   
 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising from the 
retranslation  of  non-monetary  items  are  included  in  profit  or  loss  for  the  period  except  for  exchange 
differences arising from the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are 
recognized  directly  in  other  comprehensive  income,  in  which  cases,  the  exchange  differences  are  also 
recognized in other comprehensive income. 
 
Non-monetary  items  that  are  measured  at  historical  cost  in  a  foreign  currency  are  translated  using  the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
 
For  the  purposes  of  presenting  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the 
Company’s  foreign  operations  (including  subsidiaries,  associates,  joint  ventures  and  branches  in  other 
countries that use currencies which are different from the currency of the Company) are translated into 
the presentation currency, the New Taiwan dollars, as follows: Assets and liabilities are translated at the 
exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period; and income and expense items are translated 
at  the  transacting  exchange  rate  or  the  average  exchange  rates  for  the  period.  The  resulting  currency 
translation differences are recognized in other comprehensive income (attributed to the owners of the Bank 
and non-controlling interests as appropriate).258Current and Non-current Assets and Liabilities 
 
Since the operating cycle in the banking industry cannot be reasonably identified, accounts included in 
the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Company  were  not  classified  as  current  or  non-current. 
Nevertheless,  accounts  were  properly  categorized  in  accordance  with  the  nature  of  each  account  and 
sequenced by their liquidity. 
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
In the consolidated balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits, and 
short-term,  highly  liquid  investments  that  are  readily  convertible  to  a  known  amount  of  cash  and  are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. In the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and 
cash equivalents comprise cash and cash equivalents defined in the consolidated balance sheets, due from 
the  Central  Bank,  call  loans  to  other  banks  and  securities  purchased  under  resale  agreements  that 
correspond to the definition of cash and cash equivalents under IAS 7 - “Statement of Cash Flows,” as 
endorsed and issued into effect by the FSC. 
 
Financial Instruments 
 
Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  recognized  when  the  Company  becomes  a  party  to  the 
contractual provisions of the instruments. 
 
Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  initially  measured  at  fair  value.  Transaction  costs  that  are 
directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition  or  issue  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  (other  than 
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from 
the  fair  value  of  the  financial  assets  or  financial  liabilities,  as  appropriate,  on  initial  recognition. 
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss. 
 
a.  Financial assetsAll regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date 
basis. 
 
1)  Measurement categoryFinancial assets are classified into the following categories: Financial assets at FVTPL, financial 
assets at amortized cost, and investments in debt instruments and equity instruments at FVTOCI. 
 
a)  Financial asset at FVTPLA financial asset is classified as at FVTPL when the financial asset is mandatorily classified 
or it is designated as at FVTPL. Financial assets mandatorily classified as at FVTPL include 
investments  in  equity  instruments  which  are  not  designated  as  at  FVTOCI  and  debt 
instruments that do not meet the amortized cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria. 
 
Financial assets at FVTPL are subsequently measured at fair value, with any gains or losses 
arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit 
or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset. 
 
Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 49.259b)  Financial assets at amortized costFinancial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortized 
cost: 
 
i.  The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financialassets in order to collect contractual cash flows; andii.  The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows thatare solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets at amortized cost, including cash and cash 
equivalents,  due  from  the  Central  Bank  and  call  loans  to  other  banks,  investments  in  debt 
instruments at amortised cost, receivables and discounts and loans, are measured at amortized 
cost, which equals the gross carrying amount determined by the effective interest method less 
any impairment loss. Exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss. 
 
Interest  income  is  calculated  by  applying  the  effective  interest  rate  to  the  gross  carrying 
amount of a financial asset, except for: 
 
i.  Purchased  or  originated  credit-impaired  financial  assets,  for  which  interest  income  is 
calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortized cost of 
the financial asset; andii.  Financial  assets  that  are  not  credit  impaired  on  purchase  or  origination  but  have 
subsequently become credit impaired, for which interest income is calculated by applying 
the  effective  interest  rate  to  the  amortized  cost  of  such  financial  assets  in  subsequent 
reporting periods.A financial asset is credit impaired when one or more of the following events have occurred: 
 
i.  Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower; 
 
ii.  Breach of contract, such as a default; 
 
iii.  It  is  becoming  probable  that  the  borrower  will  enter  bankruptcy  or  undergo  a  financialreorganization; oriv.  The  disappearance  of  an  active  market  for  that  financial  asset  because  of  financialdifficulties.c)  Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCIDebt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at FVTOCI: 
 
i.  The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by boththe collecting of contractual cash flows and the selling of the financial assets; andii.  The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows thatare solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.260Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes 
in  the  carrying  amounts  of  these  debt  instruments  relating  to  changes  in  foreign  currency 
exchange rates, interest income calculated using the effective interest method and impairment 
losses or reversals are recognized in profit or loss. Other changes in the carrying amount of 
these debt instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified 
to profit or loss when the investment is disposed of.d)  Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCIOn  initial  recognition,  the  Company  may  make  an  irrevocable  election  to  designate 
investments in equity instruments as at FVTOCI. Designation as at FVTOCI is not permitted 
if the equity investment is held for trading or if it is contingent consideration recognized by an 
acquirer in a business combination. 
 
Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with 
gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in other equity. The cumulative gain or loss will not be reclassified to profit 
or  loss  on  disposal  of  the  equity  investments;  instead,  they  will  be  transferred  to  retained 
earnings. 
 
Dividends on these investments in equity instruments are recognized in profit or loss when the 
Company’s right to receive the dividends is established, unless the dividends clearly represent 
a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.2)  Impairment of financial assetsThe  Company  recognizes  a  loss  allowance  for  expected  credit  losses  on  financial  assets  at 
amortized cost, investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI.   
 
The Company always recognizes lifetime expected credit losses (ECLs) for accounts receivable 
and lease receivables. For all other financial instruments, the Company recognizes lifetime ECL 
when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. If, on the other 
hand,  the  credit  risk  on  the  financial  instrument  has  not  increased  significantly  since  initial 
recognition, the Company measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount 
equal to 12-month ECLs. 
 
For receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, the allowance for losses is 
recognized at the lifetime expected credit losses.   
 
Expected credit losses reflect the weighted average of credit losses with the respective risks of a 
default occurring as the weights. A 12-month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECLs that is 
expected to result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months 
after the reporting date. Lifetime ECLs represent the expected credit losses that will result from 
all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. 
 
The definition of the financial assets which were in default is described in Note 50. 
 
The Company recognizes an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments 
with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account, except 
for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, for which the loss allowance is 
recognized in  other  comprehensive  income  and does not reduce  the  carrying  amount of  such a 
financial asset.261According  to  the  Regulations  Governing  the  Procedures  for  Banking  Institutions  to  Evaluate 
Assets  and  Deal  with  Non-performing/Non-accrual  Loans,  the  Bank  assesses  the  customers' 
financial position, the overdue payments of the principal and interest, and the value of collaterals 
to classify credit assets into normal credit assets (excluding loans to the ROC government) and 
unsound assets which should be further classified by special mention, substandard, doubtful and 
losses,  for  which  minimum  provisions  are  1%,  2%,  10%,  50%,  and  100%  of  the  outstanding 
balance, respectively. Furthermore, the FSC stipulates that banks should recognize provision of at 
least  1.5%  of  normal  credit  assets  in  mainland  China  (including  short-term  advances  for  trade 
finance) and loans for mortgage and construction loans that have been classified as normal assets, 
and  further  determine  the  allowance  for  losses  based  on  the  higher  of  the  above-mentioned 
provision and the assessment of the expected credit losses. 
 
The Company writes off credits deemed uncollectable after the write-off is proposed and approved 
by the board of directors. Recoveries of credits written off are recognized as a reversal of loss 
provision in current period.3)  Derecognition of financial assetsThe Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows 
from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. If the Company retains substantially all the 
risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  of  a  transferred  financial  asset,  the  Company  continues  to 
recognize  the  financial  asset  and  also  recognizes  a  collateralized  borrowing  for  the  proceeds 
received.   
 
On derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in 
profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument at FVTOCI, the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and 
the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized 
in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, 
the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred 
directly to retained earnings, without recycling through profit or loss.b.  Equity instrumentsThe  Company  classifies  the  debt  and  equity  instruments  issued  either  as  financial  liabilities  or  as 
equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual agreements and the definitions of a financial 
liability or an equity instrument. 
 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue 
costs. 
 
Repurchase of the Company’s own equity instruments is recognized and deducted directly in equity. 
No  gain  or  loss  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  on  the  purchase,  sale,  issue  or  cancellation  of  the 
Company’s own equity instruments.262c.  Financial liabilities1)  Subsequent measurementExcept for the cases stated below, all financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest method: 
 
a)  Financial liabilities at FVTPLFinancial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial liability is either held for 
trading or designated as at FVTPL. 
 
Financial  liabilities  at  FVTPL  are  stated  at  fair  value,  with  any  gains  or  losses  arising  on 
remeasurement recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss 
incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability.   
 
A financial liability is classified as designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if: 
 
i.  Such  designation  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  a  measurement  or  recognitioninconsistency that would otherwise arise; orii.  The financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or 
both,  which  is  managed  and  its  performance  is  evaluated  on  a  fair  value  basis,  in 
accordance with the Company’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and 
information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; oriii.  The  contract  contains  one  or  more  embedded  derivatives  so  that  the  entire  hybrid(combined) contract can be designated as at fair value through profit or loss.For a financial liability designated as at fair value through profit or loss, the amount of changes 
in  fair  value  attributable  to  changes  in  the  credit  risk  of  the  liability  is  presented  in  other 
comprehensive income, and it will not be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. The gain 
or loss accumulated in other comprehensive income will be transferred to retained earnings 
when  the  financial liabilities  are  derecognized. The change  in fair  value  of the outstanding 
liabilities  are recognized  in  profit  or  loss.  If  this accounting  treatment related  to  credit  risk 
would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch, all changes in fair value of the liability are 
presented in profit or loss. 
 
Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 49.b)  Financial guarantee contractsFinancial  guarantee  contracts  issued  by  the  Company,  if  not  designated  as  at  FVTPL,  are 
subsequently measured at the higher of: 
 
i.  The amount of the loss allowance reflecting expected credit loss; and 
 
ii.  The amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of incomerecognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policies.2)  Derecognition of financial liabilitiesThe  difference  between  the  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  liability  derecognized  and  the 
consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized 
in profit or loss.263d.  DerivativesDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into 
and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss 
is recognized in profit or loss immediately. If the fair value of a derivative is a positive number, the 
derivative  is  recognized  as  an  asset  and  if  the  fair  value  is  a  negative  number,  the  derivative  is 
recognized as a liability.   
 
Derivatives embedded in hybrid contracts that contain financial asset hosts within the scope of IFRS 
9  are  not  separated;  instead,  the  classification  is  determined  in  accordance  with  the  entire  hybrid 
contract. Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts that are not financial assets within the 
scope  of  IFRS  9  (e.g.  financial  liabilities)  are  treated  as  separate  derivatives  when  they  meet  the 
definition  of  a  derivative, their  risks and characteristics  are  not  closely  related to  those  of  the  host 
contracts and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL.Investments in Associates 
 
An  associate  is  an  entity  over  which  the  Company  has  significant  influence  and  which  is  neither  a 
subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. 
 
The Bank uses the equity method to account for its investments in associates. Under the equity method, 
investments in an associate are initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Bank’s 
share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate. The Bank also recognizes the 
changes in the Bank’s share of the equity of associates attributable to the Bank. 
 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Bank’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets 
and liabilities of an associate at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill, which is included within 
the carrying amount of the investment and is not amortized. Any excess of the Bank’s share of the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of acquisition is recognized immediately in 
profit or loss. 
 
When the Bank subscribes for additional new shares of an  associate at a percentage different from its 
existing ownership percentage, the resulting carrying amount of the investment differs from the amount 
of the Bank’s proportionate interest in the associate. The Bank records such a difference as an adjustment 
to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus - changes in capital 
surplus from investments in associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method. If the 
Bank’s ownership interest is reduced due to its additional subscription of the new shares of the associate, 
the proportionate amount of the gains or losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income in 
relation to that associate is reclassified to profit or loss on the same basis as would be required had the 
investee directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. When the adjustment should be debited to 
capital surplus, but the capital surplus recognized from investments accounted for using the equity method 
is insufficient, the shortage is debited to retained earnings. 
 
When the Bank’s share of losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interest in that associate (which 
includes  any  carrying  amount  of the  investment  accounted  for  using  the equity method  and long-term 
interests that, in substance, form part of the Bank’s net investment in the associate), the Bank discontinues 
recognizing its share of further loss, if any. Additional losses and liabilities are recognized only to the 
extent  that  the  Bank  has  incurred  legal  obligations,  or  constructive  obligations,  or  made  payments  on 
behalf of that associate. 
 
The entire carrying amount of an investment (including  goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single 
asset by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized is 
not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. 
Any  reversal  of  that  impairment  loss  is  recognized  to  the  extent  that  the  recoverable  amount  of  the 
investment subsequently increases.264The Bank discontinues the use of the equity method from the date on which its investment ceases to be an 
associate. Any retained investment is measured at fair value at that date, and the fair value is regarded as 
the investment’s fair value on initial recognition as a financial asset. The difference between the previous 
carrying amount of the associate attributable to the retained interest and its fair value is included in the 
determination  of  the  gain  or  loss  on  disposal  of  the  associate.  The  Bank  accounts  for  all  amounts 
previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate on the same basis as 
would be required had that associate directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. If an investment 
in an associate becomes an investment in a joint venture or an investment in a joint venture becomes an 
investment in an associate, the Bank continues to apply the equity method and does not remeasure the 
retained interest. 
 
Profits or losses resulting from downstream transactions are eliminated in full only in the Bank’s financial 
statements. Profits and losses resulting from upstream transactions and transactions between associates 
are recognized only in the Bank’s financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associates that 
are not related to the Bank. 
 
Nonperforming Loans 
 
Under the “Regulations Governing the Procedures for Banking Institutions to Evaluate Assets and Deal 
with Nonperforming/Nonaccrual Loans” issued by the authorities, loans and other credits (including the 
accrued interest) that remain unpaid on their maturity are transferred immediately to nonperforming loans 
if the transfer is approved by the board of directors.   
 
Nonperforming loans transferred from loans are recognized as discounts and loans, and those transferred 
from other credits are recognized as other financial assets. 
 
Repurchase and Resale Transactions 
 
Securities  purchased  under  resale  agreements  and  securities  sold  under  repurchase  agreements  are 
generally treated as collateralized financing transactions. Interest earned on reverse repurchase agreements 
or interest incurred on repurchase agreements is recognized as interest income or interest expense over the 
life of each agreement. 
 
Property and Equipment 
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. 
 
Freehold land is not depreciated. 
 
Depreciation of property and equipment is recognized using the straight-line method. Each significant part 
is depreciated separately. If the lease term of an item of property and equipment is shorter than its useful 
life,  such  asset  is  depreciated  over  its  lease  term.  The  estimated  useful  lives,  residual  values  and 
depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effects of any changes in 
the estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. 
 
On derecognition of an item of property and equipment, the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset is recognized in profit or loss. 
 
Investment Properties 
 
Investment  properties  are  properties  held  to  earn  rentals  and/or  for  capital  appreciation.  Investment 
properties also include land held for a currently undetermined future use. 
 
Investment  properties  are  measured  initially  at  cost,  including  transaction  costs,  and  are  subsequently 
measured using the fair value model. Changes in the fair value of investment properties are included in 
profit or loss for the period in which they arise.265On  derecognition  of  an  investment  property,  the  difference  between  the  net  disposal  proceeds  and  the 
carrying amount of the asset is included in profit or loss. 
 
The Company decides to transfer in or out investment property based on the actual use of assets. 
 
For a transfer from the property and equipment classification to investment property based on the actual 
use of assets, any difference between the fair value of the property at the transfer date and its previous 
carrying amount is recognized in other comprehensive income. 
 
Goodwill 
 
Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition 
of the business less accumulated impairment loss. 
 
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s cash-generating 
units or groups of cash-generating units (referred to as “cash-generating units”) that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. 
 
A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired, by comparing its carrying amount, 
including the attributed goodwill, with its recoverable amount. However, if the goodwill allocated to a 
cash-generating unit was acquired in a business combination during the current annual period, that unit 
shall be tested for impairment before the end of the current annual period. If the recoverable amount of 
the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then pro rata to the other assets of the unit 
based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss is recognized directly in profit 
or loss. Any impairment loss recognized on goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods. 
 
If goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and the entity disposes of an operation within that 
unit, the goodwill associated with the operation which is disposed of is included in the carrying amount 
of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal and is measured on the basis of the relative 
values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained. 
 
Foreclosed Collateral 
 
Collaterals assumed (recorded in other assets) are recognized at cost, which includes the assumed prices 
and  any  necessary  repairs  to  make  the  collaterals  saleable,  and  evaluated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  net 
realizable value as of the balance sheet date. 
 
Intangible Assets (Excluding Goodwill) 
 
Intangible assets acquired separately 
 
Intangible  assets  with finite  useful lives that  are  acquired separately  are  initially  measured  at  cost  and 
subsequently  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated  amortization  and  accumulated  impairment  losses. 
Amortization  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis.  The  estimated  useful  lives,  residual  values,  and 
amortization methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in 
the estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. 
 
Derecognition 
 
On derecognition of an intangible asset, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset is recognized in profit or loss.266Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets (Excluding Goodwill) 
 
At  the  end  of  each  reporting  period,  the  Company  reviews  the  carrying  amounts  of  its  tangible  and 
intangible assets, excluding goodwill, to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have 
suffered any impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated 
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. Corporate assets are allocated to cash-generating 
units on a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation. 
 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. If the recoverable 
amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the resulting 
impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss. When an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the 
reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss. But only to the extent of the carrying amount 
(net  of  depreciation  or  amortization)  that  would  have  been  determined  had  no  impairment  loss  been 
recognized for the asset. 
 
Leasing2019 
 
At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease.a.  The Company as lessorLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of a lease transfer substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
 
Lease payments (less any lease incentives payable) from operating leases are recognized as income 
on a straight-line basis over the terms of the relevant leases. Initial direct costs incurred in obtaining 
operating leases are added to the carrying amounts of the underlying assets and recognized as expenses 
on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. 
 
Variable  lease  payments that  do  not depend  on  an  index  or  a  rate  are recognized  as  income  in the 
periods in which they are incurred. 
 
When a lease includes both land and building elements, the Company assesses the classification of 
each  element  separately  as  a  finance  or  an  operating  lease  based  on  the  assessment  as  to  whether 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of each element have been transferred 
to  the  Company.  The  lease  payments  are  allocated  between  the  land  and  the  building  elements  in 
proportion to the relative fair values of the leasehold interests in the land element and building element 
of the lease at the inception of a contract. If the allocation of the lease payments can be made reliably, 
each element is accounted for separately in accordance with its lease classification. When the lease 
payments  cannot  be  allocated  reliably  between  the  land  and  building  elements,  the  entire  lease  is 
generally classified as a finance lease unless it is clear that both elements are operating leases; in which 
case, the entire lease is classified as an operating lease.b.  The Company as lesseeThe Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases at the commencement 
date  of  a  lease,  except  for  short-term  leases  and  low-value  asset  leases  accounted  for  applying  a 
recognition exemption where lease payments are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis over 
the lease terms.267Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial measurement of lease 
liabilities adjusted for lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct 
costs  incurred  and  an  estimate  of  costs  needed  to  restore  the  underlying  assets,  and  less  any  lease 
incentives  received.  Right-of-use  assets  are  subsequently  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liabilities. Right-
of-use assets are presented on a separate line in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to 
the earlier of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. 
 
Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, which comprise fixed 
payments, in-substance fixed payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate, 
residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain 
to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the lease term reflects such 
termination, less any lease incentives receivable. The lease payments are discounted using the interest 
rate implicit in a lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, 
the Company uses the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. 
 
Subsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with 
interest expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in 
the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, a change in the assessment of 
an option to purchase an underlying asset, or a change in future lease payments resulting from a change 
in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities 
with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use-assets. However, if the carrying amount of the 
right-of-use assets is reduced to zero, any remaining amount of the remeasurement is recognized in 
profit or loss. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the 
periods in which they are incurred.2018 
 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of a lease transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.a.  The Company as lessorRental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant 
lease.  Initial  direct  costs  incurred  in  negotiating  and  arranging  an  operating  lease  are  added  to  the 
carrying amount of the leased asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.   
 
Lease  incentives  included  in  an  operating  lease  are  recognized  as  an  asset.  The  aggregate  cost  of 
incentives is recognized as a reduction of rental income on a straight-line basis. 
 
Contingent rentals are recognized as income in the period in which they are incurred.b.  The Company as lesseeOperating lease payments are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
 
Lease incentives received under operating leases are recognized as liabilities. The aggregate benefit 
of incentives is recognized as a reduction of rental expenses on a straight-line basis.   
 
Contingent rentals are recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.268c.  Leasehold land for own useWhen a lease includes both land and building elements, the Company assesses the classification of 
each  element  separately  as  a  finance  or  an  operating  lease  based  on  the  assessment  as  to  whether 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of each element have been transferred 
to  the  Company.  The  minimum  lease  payments  are  allocated  between  the  land  and  the  building 
elements in proportion to the relative fair values of the leasehold interests in the land element and 
building element of the lease at the inception of the lease. 
 
If the allocation of the lease payments can be made reliably, each element is accounted for separately 
in  accordance  with  its  lease  classification.  When  the  lease  payments  cannot  be  allocated  reliably 
between the land and building elements, the entire lease is generally classified as a finance lease unless 
it is clear that both elements are operating leases; in which case, the entire lease is classified as an 
operating lease.Provisions 
 
Provisions are recognized when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a 
past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.   
 
Provisions  is  the  best  estimate  of  the  consideration  required  to  settle  a  present  obligation  at  the 
consolidated balance sheet date, taking the risks and uncertainties into account on the obligation. When a 
provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying its the 
present value of those cash flows. (If the time value of currency affects materially.) 
 
Employee Benefitsa.  Short-term employee benefitsLiabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at  the undiscounted 
amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related services.b.  Retirement benefitsPayments  to  defined  contribution  retirement  benefit  plans  are  recognized  as  an  expense  when 
employees have rendered services entitling them to the contributions. 
 
Defined  benefit  costs  (including  service  cost,  net  interest  and  remeasurement)  under  the  defined 
benefit retirement benefit plans are determined using the projected unit credit method. Service cost 
(including  current  service  cost  and  past  service  cost)  and  net  interest  on  the  net  defined  benefit 
liabilities  (assets)  are  recognized  as  employee  benefits  expense  in  the  period  in  which  they  occur. 
Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling 
and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the 
period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected 
immediately in other equity and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.   
 
Net defined benefit liabilities (assets) represent the actual deficit (surplus) in the Company’s defined 
benefit plan. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any refunds 
from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.c.  Termination benefitsA  liability  for  a  termination  benefit  is  recognized  at  the  earlier  of  when  the  Bank  can  no  longer 
withdraw the offer of the termination benefit and when the Bank recognizes any related restructuring 
costs.269d.  Employee preferential interest depositsThe Bank offers its employees preferential interest deposits, including of preferential interest deposits 
to current employees and those to retired employees and current employees after retirement in finite 
amounts. The difference between the interest rate of preferential interest deposits and the market rate 
is considered as employee benefits. 
 
In accordance with Article 30 of the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by 
Public Banks, the excess of the interests incurred from post-employment preferential interest deposits 
over  those inputed by  the market  rate  should be  applicable to the  requirements for defined  benefit 
plans in IAS 19 Employee Benefits since the employee’s retirement and accrued by actuarial method.Income Tax 
 
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.a.  Current taxAccording to the Income Tax Law, an additional tax of unappropriated earnings is provided for as 
income tax in the year the stockholders approve to retain earnings. 
 
Adjustments  of  prior  years’  tax  liabilities  are  added  to  or  deducted  from  the  current  year’s  tax 
provision. 
 
Since  2002,  in  accordance with  Article  49  of  the  Financial  Holding  Company  Act,  the  Bank  elect 
Financial  Holding  Company  to  be  the  tax  payer,  and  jointly  declare  and  report  profit-seeking 
enterprise  income  tax  and  the  tax  surcharge  on  surplus  retained  earnings  of  a  profit-enterprise  in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Law. Addition tax payable or receivable 
due to the joint declaration of income tax is recognized under the payables or receivables for allocation 
of integrated income tax systems account.b.  Deferred taxDeferred  tax  is  recognized  on  temporary  differences  between  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and 
liabilities  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  corresponding  tax  bases  used  in  the  computation  of 
taxable profit.   
 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax 
assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences and unused loss carryforwards 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible 
temporary differences can be utilized.   
 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments 
in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Bank can control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated 
with such investments and interests are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that there will 
be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and these 
differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or 
part of the asset to be recovered. A previously unrecognized deferred tax asset is also reviewed at the 
end  of  each  reporting  period  and  recognized  to  the  extent  that  it  has  become  probable  that  future 
taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.270Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period 
in which the liabilities are settled or the assets are realized, based on tax rates and tax laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred 
tax liabilities and assets should reflect the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in 
which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount 
of its assets and liabilities.c.  Current and deferred taxesCurrent and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are 
recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  or  directly  in  equity;  in  which  case,  the  current  and 
deferred taxes are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.Recognition of Interest Revenue and Expense 
 
Except for the financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the interest revenue and 
interest expense arising from all interest-bearing financial instruments are calculated using the effective 
interest method in accordance with the relevant provisions and recognized in the consolidated statement 
of profit or loss under “interest revenue” and “interest expense” items. 
 
Recognition of Service Fee Revenue and Expense 
 
The service fee revenue and expense are recognized once after the completion of the provision of the loan 
or  other  services;  if  the  service  fee  earned  by  the  execution  of  the  major  project  is  recognized  at  the 
completion of the major project, service fee revenue and expense related to subsequent lending services 
are either amortized over the service period or included in the calculation of the effective interest rate on 
loans and receivables. 
 
Customer Loyalty Program 
 
The  points  earned  by  customers  under  loyalty  programs  are  treated  as  multiple-element  revenue 
arrangements, in which consideration is allocated to the goods or services and the award credits based on 
their fair values through the eyes of the customer. The consideration is not recognized as earnings at the 
time of the original sales transaction but at the time when the points are redeemed and the obligation is 
fulfilled.5.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATIONUNCERTAINTY 
 
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, the Company’s management is required to make 
judgments,  estimates  and  assumptions  about  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  not 
readily  apparent  from  other  sources. The  estimates  and  associated  assumptions are  based  on  historical 
experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
The estimates and  underlying  assumptions  are reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Revisions  to  accounting 
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that 
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future 
periods.271Assessment of impairment of loansThe assessment of impairment of loans is based on the value of the collaterals, amount of principal and 
interest  due,  and  the  length  of  the  overdue  period.  Change  of  credit  ratings  on  individual  assets  and 
collection received are also considered to determine the category. The Company uses judgment in making 
these  assumptions  and  in  selecting  the  inputs  to  the  impairment  calculation,  based  on  the  Company’s 
historical experience, existing  market conditions as well as forward looking estimates as of the end of 
each reporting period. The inputs include risk of default and expected loss rates. For details of the key 
assumptions and inputs used, refer to Note 50.6.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTSCash on hand

Financial Liabilities Designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss 
 
In  September  2014,  the  Bank  was  authorized  to  issue  subordinated  financial  debentures  amounting  to 
US$990 million; as of October 8, 2014, the issued subordinated financial debentures were US$660 million 
(perpetual) and US$330 million (fifteen years) with a fixed interest rate of 5.10% and 4.00%, respectively, 
and  the  interest  is  payable  annually.  The  Bank  is  authorized  by  the  authorities  to  redeem  the  US$660 
million of bonds at book value after 12 years and after fulfilling the specified conditions. 
 
In December 2014, the Bank was authorized to issue unsubordinated financial debentures amounting to 
US$180  million  (thirty  years),  which  were  subsequently  issued  on  March  30,  2015.  In  addition  to  the 
redemption of bonds by the exercise of call options, the bonds are redeemable on maturity; the bonds were 
issued in the form of zero-coupon bonds, and the internal rate of return is 4.20%. 
 
In  March  2017,  the  Bank  was  authorized  to  issue  unsubordinated  financial  debentures  amounting  to 
US$195  million  (thirty  years),  which  were  subsequently  issued  on  April  11,  2017.  In  addition  to  the 
redemption of bonds by the exercise of call options, the bonds are redeemable on maturity; the bonds were 
issued in the form of zero-coupon bonds, and the internal rate of return is 4.30%.   
 
In  March  2017,  the  Bank  was  authorized  to  issue  unsubordinated  financial  debentures  amounting  to 
US$300 million (thirty years), which were subsequently issued on November 24, 2017. In addition to the 
redemption of bonds by the exercise of call options, the bonds are redeemable on maturity; the bonds were 
issued in the form of zero-coupon bonds, and the internal rate of return is 4.10%.   
 
The  Bank  converted  fixed  interest  rates  into  floating  interest  rates  with  interest  rate  swap  contracts  to 
hedge against the fair value risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations. For the years ended December 
31, 2019 and 2018, such interest rate swaps were valued with a net gain of $4,094,478 thousand and net 
loss of $2,290,940 thousand, respectively.2749.  FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME2018Investments in equity instrumentsDomestic listed shares

Accordingly, the management elected to designate these investments in equity instruments as at FVTOCI 
as they believe that recognizing short-term fluctuations in these investments’ fair value in profit or loss 
would not be consistent with the Company’s strategy of holding these investments for long-term purposes. 
 
For investment strategy, the Company sold the investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI with the fair 
value of $25,613,617 thousand and $32,175,518 thousand during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 
2018, respectively, and the related unrealized loss of $147,494 thousand and unrealized gain of $487,854 
thousand were transferred from other equity to retained earnings, accordingly. 
 
Dividends  of  $994,684  thousand  and  $1,529,632  thousand  were  recognized  during  the  years  ended 
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Those related to investments held as of December 31, 2019 
and 2018 were $609,463 thousand and $602,727 thousand, respectively, and the remaining amounts were 
related to investments derecognized during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. 
 
As  of  December  31,  2019  and  2018,  certain  financial  assets  at  FVTOCI  were  sold  under  repurchase 
agreements with notional amounts of $35,649,054 thousand and $46,355,590 thousand, respectively. The 
proceeds amounting to $35,456,986 thousand and $42,613,744 thousand, respectively, were recorded as 
notes and bonds sold under repurchase agreements and were repurchased for $35,556,515 thousand and 
$42,764,361 thousand before the end of June 2020 and March 2019, respectively.

The Company monitors the external credit rating information and price movements of their investments 
in debt instruments in order to assess  whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition. 
 
The  Company  takes  into  consideration  the  multi-period  default  probability  table  for  each  credit  rating 
supplied by external rating agencies, the current financial condition of debtors, industry forecasts, rating 
of securities issued by credit rating agencies and recovery rates of different types of bonds to assess the 
12-month or lifetime expected credit losses.

Part of the purpose of holding certain real estate of the Bank is to earn rent or capital surplus, theother part is for self-use. When the part held for self-use is less than 5% of the individual real estate,the real estate is classified as investment properties.c.  The Bank’s investment properties were appraised by qualified real estate appraisers in Taiwan,according to the “Technical Rules for Real Estate Valuation.” The valuation dates were December31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Appraiser FirmREPro KnightFrank Real Estate Appraiser Firm289December 312019Hong-Xu, Wu; 
You-Xiang Cai2018Hong-Xu, Wu; 
Zhi-Hao, Wu; 
Fu-Xue, ShiThe  fair  value  is  supported  by  observable  evidence  in  the  market.  The  main  appraisal  approaches 
applied include the income approach (such as discounted cash flow model and direct capitalization 
approach),  comparison  approach  and  cost  approach.  The  significant  unobservable  inputs  mainly 
include discount rates and the related adjustments, and categorized as level 3 of fair value hierarchy. 
 
1)  As office buildings have market liquidity and their rent levels are similar to comparable properties 
in the same neighborhood, their fair values have been determined using the comparison approach 
and the income approach. 
 
Net  rental  income  is  based  on  current  market  practices,  assuming  an  annual  rent  increase  of 
between 0% to 1.5% to extrapolate the total income of the underlying property, excluding losses 
as a result of idle and other reasons and related operation costs. 
 
According to the ROC Real Estate Appraisers Association Gazette No. 5, the house tax is based 
on the actual payment data. If there is no payment data, the house tax is based on the reference 
tables of current house values from each city to estimate the total current house value, including 
the  area  of  the  subject  property  and  related  public  utilities,  and  then  calculated  with  tax  rates 
according to House Tax Act. 
 
Land value tax is based on the changes in the announced land value of the underlying property in 
the past few years and the actual payment data, to further extrapolate the announced land value in 
the future. 
 
According to the ROC Real Estate Appraisers Association Gazette No. 5, replacement allowance 
for significant renovation costs is calculated based on 10% of construction costs and amortized 
over 20 years as assumed useful life. 
 
The main parameters are as follows:Direct capitalization rate 
Overall capital interest rate20191.98%-5.76% 
  0.76%-2.89%December 3120181.98%-5.73% 
  0.76%-2.89%2)  The fair value has been determined by the method of land development analysis and comparison. 
Reserved area in hillside land, scenic land site, areas for agriculture, animal husbandry and forestry 
had  fewer  market  transactions  as their uses are  restricted  by  law,  and  will not have  significant 
changes in the market in the near future.Rate of return

-impairment22,170291During impairment testing of goodwill, the Bank treated individual business units as cash-
generating units (CGUs). Goodwill resulting from the merger was allocated to the relevant 
CGUs. The recoverable amount was determined by the value in use of each CGU and was 
calculated at the present values of the cash flow forecast for the next five years based on the 
going-concern assumption. Future cash flows were estimated on the basis of present operations 
and will be adjusted depending on the business outlook and economic trends.22.  OTHER ASSETS, NETPrepayments

     $ 3,421,427The Bank adopted a pension plan under the Labor Pension Act (the “LPA”), which is a state-managed 
defined contribution plan. Under the LPA, the Bank makes monthly contributions equal to 6% of each 
employee’s monthly salary to employees’ pension accounts in the Bureau of Labor Insurance. 
 
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized expenses of $401,391 
thousand  and  $381,983  thousand  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  comprehensive  income  in 
accordance with the defined contribution plan, respectively.294b.  Defined benefit planThe defined benefit plan adopted by domestic branches of the Bank under the Labor Standards Law 
is operated by the government of the ROC. Pension benefits are calculated on the basis of the length 
of service and average monthly salaries of the 6 months before retirement. The Bank contributes a 
fixed proportion of total monthly salaries and wages to a pension fund administered by the pension 
fund  monitoring  committee.  Pension  contributions  are  deposited  in  the  Bank  of  Taiwan  in  the 
committee’s name. Before the end of each year, the Bank assesses the balance in the pension fund. If 
the amount of the balance in the pension fund is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for employees 
who conform to retirement requirements in the next year, the Bank is required to fund the difference 
in one appropriation that should be made before the end of March of the next year. The pension fund 
is managed by the Bureau of Labor Funds, Ministry of Labor (the “Bureau”); the Bank had no right 
to influence the investment policy and strategy.

16$ 2,619,553(Concluded)Through  the  defined  benefit  plans  under  the  Labor  Standards  Law,  the  Bank  is  exposed  to  the 
following risks: 
 
1)  Investment risk: The plan assets are invested in domestic and foreign equity and debt securities, 
bank  deposits,  etc.  The  investment  is  conducted  at  the  discretion  of  the  Bureau  or  under  the 
mandated management. However, in accordance with relevant regulations, the return generated 
by plan assets shall not be below the interest rate for a 2-year time deposit with local banks.2)  Interest  risk:  A  decrease  in  interest  rate  will  increase  the  present  value  of  the  defined  benefit 
obligation; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plans’ debt 
investments.3)  Salary  risk:  The  present  value  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  is  calculated  using  the  future 
salaries  of  plan  participants.  As  such,  an  increase  in  the  salaries  of  the  plan  participants  will 
increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation.The  actuarial  valuations  of  the  present  value  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  were  carried  out  by 
qualified actuaries. The significant assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were 
as follows:

assumptions  will  remain  constant,  the  present  value  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  would  have 
increased (decreased) as follows:

the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions will occur in isolation of 
one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

post-employment  preferential  interest  deposits  of  a  change  in  single  assumption  while  all  other 
assumptions remain unchanged. The sensitivity analysis presented above might not be representative 
of the actual change in the present value of obligations on the post-employment because it was unlikely 
that  the  change  in  assumptions  would  occur  independently  of  each  other  because  some  of  the 
assumptions might be correlated.

     $ 33,610,983c.  Legal reserveA legal reserve should be appropriated until it equals the Company’s paid-in-capital. The legal reserve 
may be used to offset deficit. If the Company has no deficit and the legal reserve has exceeded 25% 
of its paid-in capital, the excess may be transferred to capital or distributed in cash. In addition, based 
on the Banking Act, if the legal reserve is less than the Company’s paid-in capital, the amount that 
may be distributed in cash should not exceed 15% of the Company’s paid-in-capital. In the event that 
the  accumulated  legal  reserve  equals  or  exceeds  the  Company's  paid-in  capital  or  the  Company  is 
sound in both its finance and business operations and have set aside legal reserve in compliance with 
the Company Law, the restrictions stipulated in the preceding paragraph shall not apply.d.  Special reserveAccording to Rule No. 1030006415 issued by the  FSC, on the first-time adoption of the fair value 
model for investment properties, the Bank shall set aside the same amount of special reserve as the 
net fair value increment transferred to retained earnings. After transferring the fair value increment of 
investment properties to retained earnings, if the Bank could not set aside a sufficient amount to the 
special reserve, the Bank could only set aside the amount according to the retained earnings balance, 
and the special reserve that is not enough to be set aside would not be counted in the accumulated fair 
value increment of investment properties. When the Bank adopts the fair value model for subsequent 
measurement of investment properties, the Bank shall set aside an equal amount of special reserve 
when  transferring  the  fair  value  increment  of  investment  properties  to  retained  earnings.  For  any 
subsequent  reversal  of  accumulated  fair  value  increment  of  investment  properties  or  disposal  of 
investment properties, the amount reversed may be distributed.300According to Rule No. 1010012865, Rule No. 1010047490 issued by the FSC and the directive titled 
“Questions and Answers for Special Reserves Appropriated Following Adoption of IFRSs,” the Bank 
should appropriate to or reverse from its special reserve certain specified amounts. Any special reserve 
appropriated  may  be  reversed  to  the  extent  that  the  net  debit  balance  reverses  and  is  thereafter 
distributed. 
 
The above special reserve may be used to offset a deficit; if the reserve has reached at least 50% of 
the paid-in capital, half of this special reserve may be capitalized.   
 
According to Rule No. 10510001510 issued by the FSC, the Bank should appropriate between 0.5% 
and 1% of net income after tax to special reserve when it appropriates earnings of 2016 through 2018. 
Since 2017, the Company is allowed to reverse special reserve at the amount of the costs of employee 
transfer and arrangement in connection with the development of financial technology.

     $ 2,933,808According to the Bank’s Articles of Incorporation, if the Bank made a profit in a fiscal year, the profit 
shall be first utilized for paying taxes and offsetting deficits of prior years, if any. If the legal reserve 
is  less  than  the  paid-in  capital,  the  legal  reserve  and  the  special  reserve  shall  be  appropriated  in 
accordance  with  the  laws  and  regulations,  and  then  any  remaining  profit  together  with  any 
undistributed retained earnings shall be used by the Bank’s board of directors as the basis for proposing 
a  distribution  plan,  which  should  be  resolved  in  the  shareholders’  meeting  for  the  distribution  of 
dividends and bonuses to shareholders. 
 
In response to a competitive environment and business growth while considering capital adequacy, 
the  Bank  adopts  a  residual  dividend  policy.  According  to  the  Bank's  business  plan,  except  for  a 
necessary amount of capital to be reserved for dividend distribution, the remainder shall be distributed 
as cash dividends as a principle. However, the maximum cash dividend may not exceed the regulatory 
limit.

3,205,47048.  IMPLEMENTATION OF CROSS-SELLING MARKETING STRATEGIES BETWEEN THEBANK, CATHAY FINANCIAL HOLDING CO., LTD., AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES 
 
The Bank has entered into cross-selling marketing contracts with Cathay Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Cathay 
Century Insurance Co., Ltd. and Cathay Securities Co., Ltd. The contracts cover joint use of operation 
sites  and  facilities  as  well  as  cross-selling  marketing  personnel.  Remuneration  apportionment  and 
expenses allocation for cross-selling marketing personnel follow the “Cathay Financial Company Scope 
of Cross-selling Marketing and Rules for Reward”. 
 
The Bank has entered into cooperation contracts with Cathay Financial Holding Co., Ltd., Cathay Life 
Insurance Co., Ltd., Cathay Century Insurance Co., Ltd., and Cathay Securities Co., Ltd. for the joint use 
of information equipment and the development, operation, maintenance and management of information 
systems. Calculation methodologies for expenses allocation have been established.49.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSa.Information on fair value hierarchy 
 
Fair  value  is  the  price  that  a  market  participant  can  receive  from  selling  an  asset  or  charge  from 
transferring a liability in an orderly transaction on a measurement date. 
 
Financial instruments are accounted for at fair value when they are originally recognized, and in many 
cases,  usually  refer  to  the  transaction  price.  After  the  measurement,  except  for  some  financial 
instruments that are measured by amortized cost, they are measured at fair value. The best evidence 
of fair value is the open quote for the active market. If the market for financial instruments is not active, 
the Bank uses an evaluation model or a reference to Bloomberg, Reuters or counterparty quotes to 
measure the fair value of financial instruments.324b.  The definitions of each level of the fair value hierarchy are shown below:1)  Level 1Level 1 financial instruments are traded in an active market in which there are quoted prices for 
identical assets and liabilities. An active market has the following characteristics: 
 
a)  All financial instruments in the market are homogeneous. 
 
b)  There are willing buyers and sellers in the market all the time. 
 
c)  The public can access the price information easily. 
 
The products in this level, such as listed stock and beneficial securities, usually have high liquidity 
or are traded in the futures market or exchanges.2)  Level 2The products in this level have fair values that can be inferred from either directly or indirectly 
observable inputs other than quoted prices in an active market. The observation inputs were as 
follows: 
 
a)  Quoted  prices  from  similar  products  in  an  active  market.  This  means  the  fair  value  can  be 
derived  from  the  current  trading  prices  of  similar  products,  and  whether  they  are  similar 
products should be judged on the characteristics and trading rules. The fair price valuation in 
this circumstance may be adjusted due to time differences, trading rule differences, interested 
parties’ prices, and the correlation of price between itself and similar goods;b)  Quoted prices for identical or similar financial instruments in inactive markets; 
 
c)  For  the  marking-to-model  method,  the  inputs  to  this  model  should  be  observable  (such  as 
interest  rates,  yield  curves  and  volatilities).  The  observable  inputs  mean  that  they  can  be 
obtained from the market and can reflect the expectation of market participants;d)  Inputs that are derived from observable market data through correlation or other means. 
 
The fair values of products categorized in this level are usually calculated using a valuation model 
generally accepted by the market, such as forward contracts, cross-currency swap contracts, simple 
interest bearing bonds, convertible bonds and commercial paper.3)  Level 3The fair values of the products in this level are typically based on management assumptions or 
expectations other than the direct market data. For example, historical volatility used in valuing 
options  is  an  unobservable  input  because  it  cannot  represent  the  entire  market  participants’ 
expectation on future volatility. 
 
The products in this level are complex derivate financial instruments or products with prices that 
are provided by brokers, such as complex foreign exchange options.325c.

orderly  transaction  between  willing  market  participants  with  full  understanding  of  the  sale  or 
transfer transaction. The fair values of financial instruments at fair value, financial assets at fair 
value  through  other  comprehensive  income  and  hedging  derivative  financial  instruments  with 
quoted prices in an active market are based on their market prices; financial instruments with no 
quoted prices in an active market are estimated by valuation methods. 
 
a)  Marking to marketThis method should be considered first when determining fair value. The following are the 
principles to follow when marking to market: 
 
i.  Ensure the consistency and integrity of market data. 
 
ii.  The source of market data should be transparent and easy to access and can be referred toby independent resources.iii.  Listed securities with tradable prices should be valued at closing prices. 
 
iv.  Evaluating  unlisted  securities that lack tradable  closing  prices  should use  quoted  pricesfrom independent brokers.b)  Marking to modelThe use of marking to model is suggested if marking to market is infeasible. This valuation 
methodology  is  based  upon  model  inputs  that  are  used  to  derive  the  value  of  the  trading 
positions.  The  Bank  uses  the  same  estimations  and  assumptions  as  those  used  by  market 
participants to determine the fair value. 
 
The Company uses the forward rates provided by Reuters to estimate the fair values of forward 
contracts,  foreign  exchange  swap  contracts,  interest  rate  swap  and  cross-currency  swap 
contacts and the discounted cash flow method to calculate the fair values of each contract. For 
foreign exchange option transactions, the Company uses the option pricing models which are 
generally used by other market participants (e.g., the Black-Scholes model) to calculate the 
fair value of the contracts.3)  Fair value adjustmentsCredit risk valuation adjustments 
 
Credit risk evaluation adjustment refers to the fair value of the Over The Counter (OTC) derivative 
financial commodity contracts, which also reflects the credit risk of both parties. It can be mainly 
divided into “credit evaluation adjustment” and “debit evaluation adjustment”: 
 
a)  Credit value adjustments (CVA): A transaction in a non-concentrated trading market, that is, 
the adjustment of the derivatives contract evaluation in the OTC transaction, which reflects 
the  possibility  that  the  Company  may  not  be  able  to  collect  the  full  market  value  or  the 
counterparty may default on the repayment on the fair value.b)  Debit value adjustments (DVA): It refers to the transactions of the non-concentrated trading 
market, that is, the adjustment of the derivatives contract evaluation in the OTC transaction, 
which reflects the possibility that the Company may not be able to collect the full market value 
or the counterparty may default on the repayment of the fair value.327Both CVA and DVA are concepts of estimated loss, calculated as the probability of default 
(PD) multiplied by the default loss rate (LGD) and multiplied by the exposure at default (EAD). 
 
For  customers  with  external  credit  ratings,  the  default  probability  is  based  on  the  default 
probability corresponding to the external rating; for customers without external credit ratings, 
the  impairment  rate  calculated  according  to  the  Bank’s  loan  and  receivable  impairment 
assessment and the average incidence of impairment is taken as the default probability. 
 
The Bank uses the fair value of OTC derivatives to calculate the amount of default risk (EAD). 
 
The Bank uses 60% as the default loss rate based on the recommendation of “IFRS 13 CVA 
and DVA Related Disclosure Guidelines” of the Stock Exchange. 
 
The Company incorporates the credit risk assessment adjustment into the fair value calculation 
of  financial  instruments  to  reflect  the  counterparty’s  credit  risk  and  the  Company’s  credit 
quality.4)  Transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the periodThere were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and

The Company’s risk management department is responsible for validating the fair value 
measurements and ensuring that the results of the valuation are in line with market 
conditions, based on independent and reliable inputs which are consistent with other 
information, and represent exercisable prices. The department analyses the movements 
in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be re-measured or re-assessed 
as per the Company’s accounting policies at each reporting date.d.  Financial instrument that were not measured at fair value1)  Information on fair valueExcept as detailed in the following table, the management considers the carrying 
amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recognized in the consolidated 
financial statements approximate their fair values or that the fair values cannot be

that are not measured at fair value are as follows: 
 
a)  Cash and cash equivalents, due from the Central Bank and call loans to other banks, securities 
purchased under resale agreements, receivables, other financial assets, due to the Central Bank 
and  other  banks,  call  loans  from  the  Central  Bank  and  other  banks,  securities  sold  under 
repurchase agreements, payables, deposits and remittances whose maturity date is very close 
or the future payment price is similar to the carrying amount, so the fair value of the book is 
calculated based on the amount of the book on the balance sheet date.330b)  Discounts and loans, deposits, financial debentures and structured commodity principals are 
all interest-bearing financial assets/liabilities whose book value is similar to the current fair 
value. The book value of the collection is deducted from the estimated recoverable amount 
after the allowance for bad debts, so the book value is the fair value.c)  If an investment in a debt instrument at amortized cost has a public quoted price in an active 
market,  the  market  price is  the  fair  value; if  no  market  price is  available for reference,  the 
evaluation method is used to estimate the fair value. The estimates and assumptions used by 
the Bank in the use of the valuation method are consistent with the information used by market 
participants in the estimation of financial products and the assumptions.50.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTThe  Bank’s  risk  control  and  hedging  strategy  follows  the  requirement  of  customer  service-oriented 
banking industry and regulatory environment. In order to comply with the above requirements, the Bank 
adopted  different  risk  management  methods  to  identify  its  risks  and  the  Bank  followed  the  spirit  and 
regulation of the “Basel Accord” to keep strengthening its assets and the practices of capital management 
to maintain the best capital adequacy ratio.   
 
The Bank setup the risk management committee, whose responsibilities are as follows:a.  To amend the risk management policies, risk appetite or risk tolerance and report the above issues toboard of directors for approval.b.  To manage and decide the strategy about the Bank’s credit risk, market risk and operational risk. 
 
c.  To report the significant risk management issues, such as credit ratings, market assessment and riskindicators.d.  To analyze the issues that the Bank’s business unit brought up for discussion.e.  Other issues.The Bank organized a risk management group to monitor, lead, develop, and establish the integral risk 
management framework.a.  Credit riskCredit risk represents the risk of loss that the Bank would incur if counterparty fails to perform its 
contractual obligations. Sources of credit risk cover both on and off balance sheet accounts. 
 
The Bank, Indovina Bank and CUBCN Bank 
 
To  centralize  risk  management  functions  currently  handled  by  different  departments,  the  Bank, 
Indovina  Bank  and  CUBCN  Bank  board  of  directors  resolved  that  a  risk  management  department 
would  be  established  to  manage  the  credit  risk.  The  objectives  of  a  credit  risk  management  are  to 
improve  asset  quality  and  to  generate  stable  profits  while  reducing  risk  through  a  diversified  and 
balanced  loan  portfolio.  The  Bank,  Indovina  Bank  and  CUBCN  Bank  board  of  directors  sets  the 
counterparty credit limits, which are then implemented by the credit committee. The credit committee 
also monitors current and potential credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate 
basis  to  counterparties  and  their  affiliates.  The  Bank  and  Indovina  Bank  perform  periodic  and 
systematic detailed reviews of its lending portfolios to identify credit risks and to assess the overall 
collectability of those portfolios.331The Bank, Indovina Bank and CUBCN Bank maintain a strict policy to evaluate customers’ credit 
ratings  when  providing  loan  commitments  and  commercial  letters  of  credit  transactions.  Certain 
customers are required to provide appropriate collateral for the related loans, and the Bank, Indovina 
Bank and CUBCN Bank retains the legal right to foreclose on or liquidate the collateral. The disclosure 
of the maximum credit exposure shall not take account of any collateral held or other enhancements. 
 
CUBC Bank 
 
CUBC Bank board of directors resolved that a risk management department would be established to 
manage the credit risk. CUBC Bank board of directors sets the counterparty credit limits, which are 
then implemented by the credit committee. 
 
Loan Committee is the top lending authority within CUBC Bank. It is in charged with approval of all 
credit  in  excess  of  CUBC  Bank  lending  authorities.  Certain  customers  are  required  to  provide 
appropriate collateral for the related loans, and CUBC Bank retains the legal right to foreclose on or 
liquidate the collateral. The disclosure of the maximum credit exposure shall not take account of any 
collateral held or other enhancements. 
 
The judgement of significant increase in credit risk after initial recognition 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank 
 
The  Bank  and  CUBCN  Bank  assess  the  movement  in  default  risk  during  the  expected  lifetime  of 
various  types  of  credit  assets  at  each  reporting  date  to  determine  if  the  credit  risk  has  increased 
significantly since the initial recognition. To make this assessment, the Bank and CUBCN Bank have 
considered to show the reasonable and corroborative information (including prospective information) 
on  the  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  after  the  initial  recognition.  The  key  indicators  for 
consideration include: 
 
1)  Quantitative indicatorsa)  Changes on credit ratingWhen the credit rating at the reporting date has decreased to some extent compared with that 
on initial recognition and the credit rating has not met the investment grade, it is determined 
that the credit risk has increased significantly since the initial recognition.b)  Information on the overdue status of the contractWhen the contract payment was overdue for more than 30 days as at the reporting date, it is 
determined that the credit risk has increased significantly since the initial recognition.2)  Qualitative indicatorsWhen the information observed at the reporting date meets the following conditions, it is 
determined that the credit risk has increased significantly since the initial recognition. 
 
a)  The refund records are reported. 
 
b)  Accountants have expressed significant doubt on its ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
c)  Other internal or external information on judging the credit quality changes.332Indovina Bank 
 
Indovina Bank assesses the movement in default risk during the expected lifetime of various types of 
financial assets at each reporting date to determine if the credit risk has increased significantly since 
the initial recognition: 
 
1)  Notch downgradeA  notch  downgrade  of  obligor’s  internal  or  external  ratings  between  the  current  grade  and  the 
grade  at  initial  recognition  greater  than  specific  threshold  would  be  classified  as  a  significant 
increase in credit risk since initial recognition.2)  Low credit risk criteriaAn exposure rated below Moody’s investment grade (i.e. the credit rating is lower than the credit 
rating  Baa3  of  Moody's,  an  international  credit  rating  agency)  at  the  reporting  date  would  be 
classified as a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.3)  Past due informationThe contract payment over 30 days past due would be classified as a significant increase in credit 
risk since initial recognition.4)  Internal credit assessment indicatorsThe indicators with credit quality information that is weaker than upon initial recognition would 
be classified as a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.CUBC BankCUBC  Bank  assesses  if  the  credit  risk  of  financial  assets  at  each  reporting  date  has  increased 
significantly since the initial recognition based on the following indicators: 
 
1)  Past due informationContract payment is more than 30 days past due for long-term loans or 15 days past due for short-
term loans would indicate a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.2)  Loan classification from National Bank of CambodiaA loan contract with special mention position at reporting date would be classified as a loan with 
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.3)  Internal credit assessment indicatorsCredit quality information at the reporting date that is weaker than upon initial recognition would 
be an indicator of a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.333Default and credit impairment of financial asset 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank 
 
The  Bank  and  CUBCN  Bank  definition  of  default  on  financial  assets  is  the  same  with  the  one  of 
judging the credit impairment of financial assets. Where one or more of the following conditions are 
met, the Bank determines the financial assets to be subject to default and credit impairment. 
 
1)  Quantitative indicatora)  Changes on credit ratingWhen the credit rating at the reporting date fell into the default level, it is determined as credit 
impairment.b)  Information on the overdue status of the contractWhen the contract payment was overdue for more than 90 days as at the reporting date, it is 
determined as credit impairment.2)  Qualitative indicatorWhen  the  information  observed  at  the  reporting  date  meets  the  following  conditions,  it  is 
determined as credit impairment. 
 
a)  Bailout, reorganization, individual agreement due to debtor’s financial difficulties. 
 
b)  Lawsuit action has been taken. 
 
c)  Debt settlement, debt negotiation. 
 
d)  Other internal or external information on judging the deterioration in credit quality. 
 
The aforementioned definition of default and credit impairment applies to all financial assets held 
by the Bank, and is consistent with the definition applied on the significant financial assets for the 
purpose  of  internal  credit  risk  management,  and  is  also  applied  in  the  relevant  impairment 
assessment model.Indovina Bank 
 
Indovina Bank assesses the movement in default risk during the expected lifetime of various types of 
financial assets at each reporting date to determine if the credit risk subjected to default: 
 
1)  Notch downgradeAn obligor who has failed to pay one or more of its financial obligations or is rated as default at 
the reporting date is considered to be credit-impaired.2)  Past due informationThe contract payment over 90 days past due would be classified as a credit-impaired loan.3)  Internal credit assessment indicatorsThe  indicators  with  credit  deterioration  information  used  for  internal  credit  risk  management 
purpose at the reporting date would be recognized as credit-impaired assets.334CUBC Bank 
 
CUBC  Bank  assesses  default  risk  during  the  expected  lifetime  of  various  types  of  financial  assets 
based on the following indicators at each reporting date: 
 
1)  Past due informationLoan contract with payment more than 90 days past due for long-term loans or 30 days past due 
for short-term loans would be classified as a credit-impaired loan.2)  Loan classification from National Bank of CambodiaA loan contract with specific positions, such as substandard, doubtful and loss, at reporting date 
would be classified as loan with a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.3)  Internal credit assessment indicatorsThe credit information used for internal credit risk management purpose that indicated 
credit deterioration at the reporting date would be recognized as indicator of credit-
impaired assets.The measurement of expected credit loss 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank 
 
For the purpose of assessing the expected credit losses, the Bank and CUBCN Bank classify the credit 
assets into the following groups based on credit category, credit rating, risk characteristics, enterprise 
size, product category and so on.Credit CategoryDefinitionEnterprise loanGrouped by risk characteristics, enterprise size and internal/external creditratingConsumer loanGrouped by product category and internal credit ratingCredit cardGrouped by product category and internal credit ratingWhen  the  credit  risk  of  the  financial  instrument  has  not  increased  significantly  after  the  initial 
recognition (Stage 1), the allowance for losses should be measured at the expected credit losses over 
12  months  by  the  Bank  and  CUBCN  Bank.  When  the  credit  risk  of  the  financial  instrument  has 
increased  significantly  (Stage  2)  or  the  credit  impairment  has  existed  (Stage  3)  after  the  initial 
recognition, the allowance for losses should be measured at the expected credit losses over the life 
time by the Bank and CUBCN Bank.   
 
For the measurement of the expected credit losses, the Bank and CUBCN Bank calculate its expected 
credit losses over 12 months and the life time respectively by multiplying three factors, i.e. probability 
of default (“PD”), loss given default (“LGD”) and exposure at default (“EAD”) of the borrower over 
the next 12 months and the life time, also considering the effect of the life time value of money. 
 
The PD and LGD applied in the impairment assessment of the credit business of the Bank and CUBCN 
Bank are adjusted and calculated based on the internal and external information of each group as well 
as  the  currently  observable  data  and  the  forward-looking  macroeconomic  information  (such  as 
economic growth rate, etc.). 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank assessed the EAD of loan at the reporting date. According to internal 
and external information, the Bank and CUBCN Bank consider the portion of the loan commitment 
that is expected to be drawn on over 12 months after the reporting date and the lifetime, to determine 
the EAD for calculating the expected credit losses.335The  Bank  and  CUBCN  Bank  perform  impairment  assessment  on  debt  instruments  measured  at 
FVTOCI and those measured at amortized cost in accordance with related requirements: 
 
i.  The EAD is measured at the amortized cost of a financial asset plus its interest receivable. 
 
ii.  The  PD  is  based  on  the  information  regularly  published  by  Taiwan  Ratings  and  Moody's,  and 
calculated on the basis of the adjusted historical data according to the currently observable data 
and the looking-forward macroeconomic information (e.g., gross domestic product and economic 
growth rate, etc.).iii.  The LGD is based on the information regularly published by Moody's. 
 
The valuation techniques or significant assumptions for assessing the expected credit losses have no 
significant change in 2019. 
 
Indovina Bank 
 
Indovina Bank has grouped their exposures on the basis of shared credit risk characteristic, including 
product category, counterparty type and enterprise size as follows:Category 
Loan portfolioGrouped by counterparty type and enterprise size, such as large corporate,SME and retail loansDescriptionBond portfolioGrouped by product category, external credit rating and payment ranks,such as sovereign and corporate bonds1)  Loan portfolioThe segmentation of Indovina Bank’s loan portfolio is based on its risk characteristics, such as 
product class, counterparty type and enterprise size. The measurement of expected credit loss is 
estimated  by  three  main  parameters,  including  probability  of  default,  loss  given  default  and 
exposure  at  default.  The  probability  of  default  and  loss  given  default  were  built  by  the  bank’s 
historical  delinquent  information  and  recovery  data  and  calibrated  by  selected  macroeconomic 
factors  for  forward-looking  adjustment.  The  estimated  amounts  of  exposure  at  default  were 
calculated by the amortized cost and interest receivable. At each financial reporting date, the above 
criteria for a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are not hit, the allowance 
loss shall be measured on the basis of the 12-month expected credit loss method. If financial assets 
meet the foregoing conditions of significant increases in credit risk or credit deterioration since 
initial recognition, the allowance losses shall be estimated according to the respective methods on 
the basis of lifetime expected credit losses.2)  Bond portfolioThe segmentation of Indovina Bank’s bond portfolio is based on its product class, external rating 
and payment rank. The measurement of expected credit loss is estimated by three main parameters, 
including  probability  of  default,  loss  given  default  and  exposure  at  default.  The  probability  of 
default and loss given default were built by external information with sufficient historical default 
data  and  recovery  rates  and  calibrated  by  selected  macroeconomic  factors  for  forward-looking 
adjustment. The estimated amounts of exposure at default were calculated by the amortized cost 
and interest receivable. At each financial reporting date, the above criteria for a significant increase 
in credit risk since initial recognition are not hit, the allowance loss shall be measured on the basis 
of the 12-month expected credit loss method. If financial assets meet the foregoing conditions of 
significant increases in credit risk or credit deterioration since initial recognition, the allowance 
losses shall be estimated according to the respective methods on the basis of lifetime expected 
credit losses.336CUBC Bank 
 
CUBC Bank has grouped their exposures on the basis of shared credit risk characteristic, including 
product category and counterparty types as follows:CategoryDescriptionGrouped by product characteristics, industry and counterparty type

Credit Card 
 
The segmentation of CUBC Bank’s loan portfolio is based on its risk characteristics, such as product 
class, counterparty type and loan classification by NBC. The measurement of expected credit loss is 
estimated by three main parameters, including probability of default, loss given default and exposure 
at default. The probability of default and loss given default were built by the internal and external 
historical  delinquent  information,  default  rates  and  recovery  amounts  and  calibrated  by  selected 
macroeconomic factors for forward-looking adjustment. The estimated amounts of exposure at default 
were calculated by the amortized cost and interest receivable. At each financial reporting date, the 
above criteria for a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are not hit, the allowance 
loss shall be measured on the basis of the 12-month expected credit loss method. If financial assets 
meet the foregoing conditions of significant increases in credit risk or credit deterioration since initial 
recognition, the allowance losses shall be estimated according to the respective methods on the basis 
of lifetime expected credit losses. 
 
Write-off policy 
 
If any of the following conditions apply, the Company writes off its non-performing and nonaccrual 
loans as uncollectible, less the estimated recoverable amount.   
 
The Company can not expect reasonably to collected the financial assets that including the following 
index: 
 
1)  The recovery activity has stopped. 
 
2)  Assessed the borrower does not have sufficient assets or sources of income to pay the overdraft. 
 
Financial assets have been written-off by the Company may still have ongoing recovery activity, and 
continue to follow the relevant policies to litigation proceedings. 
 
The consideration of forward-looking information 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank use historical data to analyze and identify the significant 
economic factors that affect the credit risks and expected credit losses of each group of 
assets, and use the regression model or imputation adjustment method to estimate the 
impairment parameter after the prospective adjustment. The significant economic factors 
and their impact on PD and LGD differ depending on the type of financial instruments.337The significant economic factors identified by the Bank and CUBCN Bank in 2019 were as 
follows:Credit CategoryProbability of Default (PD)Loss Given Default (LGD)Enterprise loanConsumer loanCredit CardConsumer Price Index

The category of credit asset and the grade of credit quality were narrated as follow: 
 
1)  Category of credit riskThe  credit  risk  of  the  Bank  was  classified  into  five  categories.  Normal  credit  assets  shall  be 
classified as “Category One.” The remaining unsound credit assets shall be evaluated based on the 
status of the loan collaterals and the length of time overdue. Assets that require special mention 
shall be classified as “Category Two,” assets that are substandard shall be classified as “Category 
Three,” assets that are doubtful shall be classified as “Category Four,” and assets for which there 
is  loss  shall  be  classified  as  “Category  Five”.  For  managing  the  default  credits,  the  Bank 
established  the  regulations  governing  the  procedure  to  deal  with  non-performing  loans,  non-
accrual loans and bad debts.2)  Grade of credit qualityThe Bank sets the level of credit quality based on the characteristics and scale of business (such 
as establishing the internal rating model of credit risk, setting the credit rating table or relevant 
rules to classify) to proceed with risk management.   
 
In order to measure the credit risk of the clients, the Bank employs the statistic methods and the 
professional judgment from the experts. The Bank develops the rating model of business credit 
after considering the clients’ relevant information. The model shall be reviewed periodically to 
verify if the calculated results conform to the reality and revise every parameter to optimize the 
results. 
 
With respect to consumer credit assets such as mortgages, credit cards, and small-amount credit 
loans, the Bank also evaluates default risk of clients by using the credit rating scores developed 
by the Bank and the external due diligence services. 
 
The credit quality of the Bank’s corporate borrowers is classified as excellent, good, average, and 
bad. 
 
To ensure the reasonable estimated values of credit rating system’s design, process, and relevant 
risk factors, the Bank executes the relevant verification and tests the model according to the actual 
default every year so that the calculated results will be close to actual default. 
 
The Bank evaluates the counterparties’ credit quality before transactions and refers to the domestic 
and  foreign  credit  rating  agencies,  when  rendering  different  lines  of  credit  based  on  the  credit 
quality.3)  Hedge of credit risk and easing policya)  CollateralThe Bank adopts a series of policies to lower the credit risk, and one of the frequently-used 
methods  is  requesting  borrowers  to  provide  collaterals.  To  ensure  the  creditor’s  rights,  the 
Bank sets the scope available as collaterals and the procedures of appraising, managing, and 
disposing the collaterals. In addition, a credit contract is in place to provide the credit claim 
preservation, collaterals, and offset provisions to stipulate when a credit trigger event occurs, 
the Bank may reduce the limit, cut down the payback period, or deem all debts mature. Also, 
the Bank will use the deposits that the borrowers saved in the Bank to offset the liabilities to 
lower the credit risk. 
 
Other  non-credit  business  collaterals  shall  depend  on  the  characteristics  of  the  financial 
instruments.  Only  the  asset-backed  securities  and  other  similar  financial  instruments  are 
secured by an asset pool of financial instruments.339b)  Limit of credit risk and control of credit risk concentrationTo  avoid  the  excessive  risk  concentration,  the  Bank  limits  the  credit  amounts  of  single 
counterparties  and  groups;  the  Bank  also  sets  the  investment  guide  and  regulation  of  risk 
control of equity investment to restrict the investment limits of single person (company) or 
related company (group). Furthermore, the Bank establishes relevant regulations to control the 
concentration risk of assets, and sets the credit limits by industry, group, country, and stock 
types to monitor the credit concentration risk.c)  Net settlement agreementThe Bank usually settles by the gross balance, but signs contract with some counterparties to 
settle by net balance. If a default happens, the Bank will terminate all transactions with the 
counterparty and settle by net balance in order to lower the credit risk.4)  Maximum exposures to credit riskWithout taking into account the collateral or other credit enhancement instrument, the maximum 
credit  risk  exposure  of  on-balance-sheet  financial  assets  equals  their  carrying  values.  The 
maximum credit risk exposure of off-balance-sheet items (without considering the collaterals or 
other credit enhancement is irrevocable) are as follows:

To reduce the risk from any businesses, the Bank conducts an overall assessment and takes 
appropriate risk reduction measures, such as obtaining collateral and guarantors. For obtaining 
of collateral, the Bank has Guidelines Governing Collateral, to ensure that collateral meet the 
specific criteria and has the effect of reducing the business risk. 
 
The management deems the Company is able to control and minimize the credit risk exposures 
in off-balance-sheet items as the Company uses more strict rating procedures when extending 
credits and conduct reviews regularly.

engaging  in  similar  business  activities  and  sharing  similar  economic  characteristics,  and 
vulnerable  to  the  same  economic  impacts  or  other  changes,  the  credit  concentration  risk  is 
apparent. 
 
Credit concentration risk of the Company derives from the assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet 
items, and arises from performing obligations or engaging in transactions or cross-line portfolio 
of  risk  exposures  including  credit  extension, due from  and  call  loans to  other  banks,  securities 
investment,  receivables  and  derivatives.  The  Company  does  not  significantly  concentrate  on  a 
single  client  or  counterparty,  and  the  transaction  amount  with  a  single  client  or  counterparty 
relative to the Company’s total bills discounts and loans and overdue receivables is not significant.

1.43%b.  Liquidity risk1)  Source and definition of liquidity riskLiquidity risk means banks cannot provide sufficient funding for asset size growth and 
for meeting obligations on matured liabilities or have to make late payments to 
counterparties or raise emergency funding to cover funding gaps.3422)  Liquidity risk management strategy and principlesThe purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure the availability of funds to meet 
present and future financial obligations. The Asset and Liability Management Committee 
is responsible for the planning of liquidity risk management strategy and the Financial 
Trading Department is responsible for the implementation, including liquidity risk 
measurement, interest rate sensitivity analysis, stress testing and continuous contingency 
planning with quantitative management requirements and systems. The Bank adjusts its 
liquidity gap according to its daily funds and market changes to ensure appropriate 
liquidity. When the liquidity has or expects significant changes, the Bank immediately 
reports to the board of directors.3)  Analysis  of  financial  assets  and  non-derivative  financial  liabilities  by  remaining  contractualmaturities 
 
a)  Financial assets were held to manage liquidity riskThe Bank holds highly marketable and diverse financial assets that are assumed to be easily 
liquidated in the event of an unforeseen interruption of cash flow. The financial assets were 
held to manage liquidity risk including cash and cash equivalents, due from the Central Bank 
and  call  loans  to  other  banks,  financial  assets  at  FVTPL,  financial  assets  at  FVTOCI, 
investments  in  debt  instruments  at  amortised  cost,  discounts  and  loans,  and  securities 
purchased under resell agreements.b)  Maturity analysis of non-derivative financial liabilities of the BankThe table below shows the analysis of the cash outflow of non-derivative financial liabilities 
on time remaining until the contractual maturity date. The amount disclosed is based on the

The Bank organized market risk management department and the committee of assets 
and liabilities management is responsible for monitoring the market risk management. 
The department and committee periodically examine the Bank’s structure of assets and 
liabilities; plan the pricing principle of deposit and loan and financing and using scheme 
of medium and long term funding while executing the market risk management, the 
market risk management department periodically provides the related information of 
management and reports to the authorized managers of the Bank for the management 
system, such as valuating position, risk limit management, calculating of profit and loss, 
pricing model and risk analysis, in order to control the overall market risk.2)  Market risk management strategy and processMarket risk management process 
 
a)  Identification and measurementThe operations department and risk management department of the Bank identified the market 
risk factors of risk exposure position, and measured the market risk further. Market risk factors 
are the components that could have an impact on value of financial instrument, such as interest 
rates, foreign exchange rates, equity securities…etc., including position, gain and loss, the loss 
of  stress  test,  sensitivity  (DV01,  Delta,  Vega,  Gamma)  and  Value  at  Risk  (VaR)  etc.,  to 
measure the extent of investment portfolio that is influenced by interest risk, foreign exchange 
risk and equity securities.345b)  Monitoring and reportingThe  risk  management  department  periodically  reports  the  execution  of  market  risk 
management target, position and gain/loss control, sensitivity analysis, stress test, and VaR of 
equity securities to the board of directors, and helps the board of directors to fully understand 
the status  of  market  risk  management.  The  Bank  also  establishes  a clear  reporting  process. 
Each transaction has the requirements about limitation and stop-loss points. If the transaction 
reaches its stop-loss limitation, stop-loss process will be implemented immediately. If the stop-
loss process is not implemented, the transaction department should document the reason of 
non-implementing stop loss process and responding plan. Furthermore, the department shall 
report to the executive management for approval and report to the board of directors regularly.3)  Risk management policy of the trading bookThe trading book is the portfolio of financial instruments and physical investment for the 
purpose of trading or the hedge on the trading book. Portfolio is held for trading, which 
is intended to earn the profit from bid-ask spread. Any positions aside from the above 
trading book will be in the banking book. 
 
a)  StrategyIn order to control market risk effectively and ensure flexibility in operating the transaction 
strategy, the Bank carries out various assessment and control. The portfolio of trading book 
has the risk limitation of each investment portfolio which is set according to the transaction 
strategy, category of investment and the annual profit target.b)  Policy and procedureThe Bank sets the “Rules of Market Risk Management” as the important regulation that should 
be complied with when holding trading portfolio.c)  Valuation policyIf the financial instruments of trading book have market values, they should be evaluated at 
least once each day by the information that is from an independent source and easily accessible. 
If  it’s  evaluated  by  a  model,  a  mathematical  model  should  be  used  prudently,  and  the 
assumptions  and  parameters  of  the  valuation  model  should  be  regularly  reviewed  and 
examined.d)  Method of measurementi.  The assumption and calculation of VaR: See VaR section. 
 
ii.  The Bank executes the stress test monthly with the following scenarios: The fluctuation of 
interest rate at 100bp, equity securities at 15% and foreign exchange rate at 3%, and reports 
to the risk management committee regularly.4)  Interest risk management of trading booka)  Definition of interest riskInterest risk is the risk that the trading portfolios suffer losses or the change of its fair value 
which is caused by the fluctuation of interest rate. The main instruments include the securities 
and derivatives that relate to interest rates.346b)  Interest risk management procedure of trading bookThe  Bank  prudently  choose  its  investment  target  by  studying  the  credibility  and  financial 
position of the securities issuers, their sovereign risk and the trend of interest rates. According 
to the operating strategy and the circumstances of the market, the Bank sets the transaction 
limit and stop-loss limit (including the limits of dealing room, traders, and investment…etc.) 
of the trading book that are reported to the executive management or the board of directors for 
approval.c)  Method of measurementi.  The assumption and calculation of VaR: See VaR section. 
 
ii.  The Bank measures the investment portfolio’s interest risk exposure monthly.5)  Interest risk management of banking bookThe main objective of interest risk management of the banking book is to enhance the interest risk 
management, increase the operating efficiency of the fund and strengthen the business operation.   
 
a)  StrategyInterest risk management enhances the Bank’s ability to take responsive actions to measure, 
to manage and avoid the risk that the fluctuation of interest rate may cause on the profit and 
the economic value of assets/liabilities.b)  Management procedureWhen undertaking the operations relating to interest rate instruments, the Bank identifies the 
repricing risk of interest rate, yield curve risk, basis risk and options risk characteristics. In 
additional, the Bank also measures the potential impact of interest rate changes on the profit 
and economic value of the Bank. The Bank analyzes and monitors the interest risk limits and 
each target of interest risk management monthly. The results of analysis and monitoring are 
regularly reported to not only the risk management committee but also the board of directors. 
 
If any risk management targets is found to exceed the limit during the monitoring process, it 
will be reported to the risk management committee and a solution should be proposed.c)  Method of measurementThe interest risk of the Bank mainly measures the repricing risk that is caused by the difference 
between maturity date and repricing date of the assets, liabilities, and off balance sheet items 
in banking book. To stabilize long-term profitability and ensure business growth, the Bank 
sets the monitoring indicators of interest sensitivity in major terms and implements stress test. 
Each  interest  risk  indicator  and  the  result  of  stress  test  are  reported  to  the  executive 
management regularly for review.6)  Foreign exchange risk managementa)  Definition of foreign exchange riskForeign exchange risk is the gain/loss caused by two currencies exchange at different times. 
The  Bank’s  foreign  exchange  risk  arises  from  the  derivative  instruments,  such  as  spot 
exchange, forward exchange and foreign exchange option…etc. The Bank’s foreign exchange 
transactions  are  implemented  daily  to  offset  clients’  position.  Thus,  the  Bank  suffers  little 
foreign exchange risk.347b)  Policy, procedure and measurement methodology of foreign exchange risk managementIn order to control foreign exchange risk, the Bank sets the limits of transaction and stop-loss 
limits for the dealing room and traders. Meanwhile, the Bank also sets the maximum annual 
loss limit to control the loss within the tolerable extent. Foreign exchange risk is controlled 
based on VaR. The assumption and calculation of VaR is described in VaR section. 
 
For foreign exchange risk, the Bank sets the scenario at 3% fluctuation of interest rate of major 
currencies to execute the stress test quarterly, and reports to the risk management committee.c)  The significant portfolio of foreign currency financial assets and liabilities are as follows:December 31, 2019Unit: In Thousands of Foreign CurrencyFinancial assets

      11,629,884As the Company has a large variety of foreign currencies, it is not possible to disclose foreign 
currency exchange gain or loss based on each foreign currency’s exposure to major impact. 
The foreign currency exchange gains were $1,165,079 thousand and $1,512,717 thousand for 
the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.7)  Risk management of equity securities pricea)  Definition of risk of equity securities priceThe market risk of equity securities held by the Bank includes the individual risk from the 
fluctuation  of  individual  equity  securities’  market  price  and  general  market  risk  from  the 
fluctuation of the overall price trend.b)  Purpose of risk management in equity securities pricesTo  avoid  the  massive  fluctuation  of  equity  securities  price  to  worsen  the  Bank’s  financial 
situation  or  earnings.  Also,  to  raise  the  operating  efficiency  of  capital  and  strengthen  the 
business operation.c)  Procedure of risk management of equity securities pricesThe  Bank  sets  investment  limit  on  industries,  using  the  β  value  to  measure  the  investment 
portfolio affected by the systemic risk monthly. The stop-loss point must be authorized by the 
board  of directors,  and  the  equity  investment should be  authorized  by  the  executives if the 
stop-loss point is reached but the investment is not going to be disposed of.d)  Measured methodologyThe risk of equity securities prices in trading book is mainly controlled by VaR.349The Bank’s risk of equity securities prices from its non-trading portfolio should be controlled by 
each bank according to its own business scale to develop a stress test under appropriate scenarios 
and report to the risk management committee. 
 
The Bank adopts many methodologies to manage its market risk. Value-at-risk (VaR) is one of 
the methodologies. VaR is a statistical measure that assesses potential losses that might be caused 
by  changes  in  risk  factors  over  a  specified  period  of  time  and  at  a  specific  level  of  statistical 
confidence.  The  Bank  applies  historical  simulation  with  a  statistic  confidence  of  99%  to 
extrapolate the VaR of one-year fluctuations. The following form indicates the VaR which is the 
estimation  of  potential  amount  of  loss  within  one  day.  While  the  statistic  confidence  of  99% 
represents the possible fluctuations that would be included in assumed adverse market changes. 
Base on the assumption, the VaR may exceed the amounts listed in 1 of 100 days due to the price 
changes  in  the  market.  The  overall  VaR  in  the  market  may  be  less  than  the  aggregate  VaR  of 
individual market risk factors.Factors of Market RiskInterest rate

Transferred financial assets that are part of the Bank daily operations that do not meet the criteria for 
full  removal  are  mostly  made  up  of  debt  securities  used  as  counterparty  collateral  for  repurchase 
agreements or equity securities lent out as part of securities lending agreement. The nature of these 
transactions are secured loans, and reflects the liability where the Bank are obligated to repurchase the 
transferred  financial  assets  according  to  a  fixed  price  in  future  periods.  With  respect  to  such 
transactions, the Bank will not be able to use, sell or pledge such transferred financial assets during 
the effective period. However the Bank is still exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk, hence they 
are not removed.

Calculating the Eligible Capital and Risk-Weighted Assets of Banks.”Note 2:  Formulas used were as follows:1)  Eligible capital = Common equity + Other Tier 1 capital + Tier 2 capital. 
 
2)  Risk-weighted assets = Risk-weighted asset for credit risk + Capitalrequirements for operational risk and market risk x 12.5.3)  Capital adequacy ratio = Eligible capital ÷ Risk-weighted assets. 
 
4)  Ratio of the common equity to risk-weighted assets = Common equity ÷ Risk-weighted assets.5)  Ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets = (Common equity + Other Tier 1capital) ÷ Risk-weighted assets.6)  Leverage ratio = Tier 1 capital ÷ Exposure measurement.The  Banking  Law  and  related  regulations  require  the  Bank  to  maintain  its  unconsolidated  and 
consolidated CARs at a minimum of 10.5%, the Tier 1 Capital Ratio at a minimum of 8.5% and the 
Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio at a minimum of 7%. In addition, if the Bank’s CAR falls below the 
minimum requirement, the authorities may impose certain restrictions on the amount of cash dividends 
that  the  Bank  can  declare  or,  in  certain  conditions,  totally  prohibit  the  Bank  from  declaring  cash 
dividends.52.  UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIESThe Company does not provide financial support or other support to the unconsolidated structured entities.

Opinion 
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Cathay United Bank Co., Ltd. (the 
“Bank”), which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2019, and the statements of 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the notes to 
the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies (collectively 
referred to as the “financial statements”). 
 
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of the Bank as of December 31, 2019, its financial performance and its cash flows 
for the year then ended in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial 
Reports by Public Banks and Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by 
Securities Firms. 
 
Basis for Opinion 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Regulations Governing Auditing and Attestation of 
Financial Statements by Certified Public Accountants and auditing standards generally accepted in 
the Republic of China. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Bank in accordance with The Norm of Professional Ethics for Certified Public 
Accountant of the Republic of China, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
 
Key Audit Matters 
 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2019. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.371Key audit matters for the Bank’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 are as 
follows: 
 
Impairment Assessment on Loans 
 
The domestic loans of the Bank amounted to $1,399,537,914 thousand was considered material to 
the financial statements as a whole. As the assessment of impairment of loans involves accounting 
estimates and management’s significant judgment, and as the impairment assessment on loans 
under the relevant regulations issued by the authorities is substantially larger than that under IFRS 
9, hence, we determined the impairment of the loans under the relevant regulations prescribed by 
the authorities as a key audit matter. 
 
Its management regularly assesses the impairment on its loans. Recognition of impairment loss on 
loans is based on compliance with regulations issued by the authorities regarding the classification 
of credit assets and provision of impairment loss. For the accounting policies and relevant 
information on the impairment assessment of loans, refer to Notes 4, 5 and 14. 
 
The main audit procedures we performed in response to the key audit matter described above are as 
follows: 
 
1.  We understood and tested its internal controls of impairment assessment on loans. 
 
2.  We tested the classification of the credit assets into their respective categories out of the totalfive categories to see if it complies with the relevant regulations issued by the authorities.3.  We performed the test on selected samples to ensure the appropriateness of impairment by thelength of the overdue period and the value of the collateral of each respective loan.4.  We calculated the provision of impairment loss by classifying the credit assets into theirrespective category to see if it complies with the relevant regulations issued by the authorities.Other Matter 
 
The financial statements of the Bank as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were audited 
by other auditors who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on March 21, 2019.

internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
Those charged with governance, including the supervisors, are responsible for overseeing the 
Bank’s financial reporting process.372Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the 
Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
 
As part of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of 
China, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also: 
 
1.  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether dueto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.2.  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design auditprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.3.  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accountingestimates and related disclosures made by management.4.  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accountingand, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to 
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in 
our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.5.  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, includingthe disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.6.  Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities 
or business activities within the Bank to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the audit. We remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.373From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 
31, 2019 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report 
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication. 
 
The engagement partners on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report are Li-Chi Chen 
and Shiuh-Ran Cheng.
