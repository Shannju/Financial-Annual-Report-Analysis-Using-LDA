normal operations. Domestically, the soaring epidemic condition caused the 
epidemic prevention alert to be raised to Level 3. As a result, everyday life 
was  affected  adversely  and  banks’  operations  suffered  critical  challenges. 
For example, the interest rate remained at a historically low record, thereby 
producing  pressure  on  the  management.  The  epidemic  accelerated  the 
customers’ shift toward online behavior. The business locations  needed to 
balance the epidemic prevention and customer service at the same time. The 
work  model  needed  to  be  more  resilient  to  respond  to  the  situation. 
Notwithstanding, in order to deal with such a difficult environment, with the 
high  flexibility  and  resilience  in  the  business  management,  the  Bank  still 
delivered record-high consolidated after-tax earnings of US$860 million.The  Bank’s  constant  efforts  to  improve  the  business  and  risk 
management  contribute  to  such  performance.  For  the  digital  services,  the 
Bank  also  continues  to  invest  resources  to  optimize  various  digital  and 
automated tools. As a result, customers could access the financial services 
they desired without leaving home but via the online banking webpage and 
APP last year when the worst epidemic was raging. In order to develop the 
business  opportunities  in  new  markets,  in  2021,  the  Bank  started  private 
banking  services  officially  in  Singapore,  and  also  connected  the  business 
locations  in  Taiwan  and  Hong  Kong  to  provide  customers  with  more 
diversified and comprehensive asset allocation services. These efforts spent 
by the Bank have been well recognized by customers and thereby created the 
highest profit for the Bank. The Bank also won various special honors from 
professional institutions, including “the Banker” for Taiwan's top 10 banks - 
Overall performance No. 1, “Euromoney” for the Best Bank in Taiwan, “The 
Asset” for the Best Digital Bank in Taiwan, “Asian Private Banker” for the 
Award  of  the  Best  Private  Bank  in  Taiwan  for  two  consecutive  years  and 
“Best Wealth Management” for the Best Wealth Management Award for six 
consecutive  years,  and  also  received  the  most  awards  in  15th  Wealth 
Management  Bank  and  Securities  Assessment  of  the  “Business  Today 
Magazine.”As  a  member  of  the  economic  society,  the  banking  industry  shall  be 
obligated to be a role model in dealing with the global ESG issues including 
environmental and climate changes, in order to lead the society to take action 
and make changes. Therefore, the Bank, together with the Group, commits 
to being adapted to the global 100% renewal energy initiative, “RE 100,” to 
make all of its business locations use the renewal energy comprehensively 
in 2030. Meanwhile, the Bank is also dedicated to practicing the low-carbon 
operation  in  its  routine  business.  For  example,  the  Bank  promoted  the  e-
application for “personal unsecured loans”, and also achieved the target of 
carbon reduction by 3% earlier within one year, as the first bank to receive 
double  certification  of  Carbon  Footprint  Label  and  Carbon  Footprint1Reduction Label from the government in Taiwan. In the meantime, the Bank 
also  continues  to  support  the  ESG  financing  projects  applicable  to  solar 
power, offshore wind power and renewal energy, as it uses the best effort to 
play the role of distributing economic and social resources satisfactorily. The 
Bank’s  outperformance  in  the  industry  has  been  well  recognized  by 
government  agencies  and  made  it  win  the  3rd  National  Enterprise 
Environmental  Protection  Award -  Silver.  The  Bank  also  responds  to  the 
government  policies  proactively  when 
the  epidemic  keeps  raging 
domestically, and provides enterprises and laborers with related relief loans, 
out of the intent to go through the difficult times together with the customers 
affected  by  the  epidemic.  All  of  these  practices  are  implemented  to  lead 
sustainable social development and also contribute to mutual benefits.Looking  forward  to  the  future,  even  if  the  market  generally  forecasts 
that the main global economies will move toward lift rates and then banks 
are expected to be relieved from the business pressure on profitability for a 
while,  the  epidemic  and  changeable  competitive  environment  still  remain 
challenging. In any event, Cathay United Bank will continue adhering to its 
core  values,  “Integrity,  Accountability,  and  Creativity,”  and  winning  the 
trust  of  the  related  parties  including  customers,  the  society  and  competent 
authority, thereby achieving the corporate sustainability while fulfilling its 
vision as the “top performer in the Asia Pacific.”II.  Business Report for the year 2021Changes in the local and foreign financial environment and outcomes ofbusiness plan and strategy for 2021 are explained below:The  ongoing  epidemic  brings  additional  uncertainty  to  the  outlook  of 
the  global  economy.  The  low-interest  environment  is  persisting,  and  the 
types of products offered among peers are so highly homogeneous that it is 
challenging to maintain margin. Besides, as the overseas consumption and 
tourism  economics  markets  have  not  yet  recovered,  the  consumption 
environment is expected to fluctuate depending on the epidemic condition in 
2022, and has to deal with the impact posed by changes in the competitive 
environment in the financial market at the same time. Upon acquisition of 
the  retail  banking  operations  of  CitiBank Taiwan,  DBS  Bank  will  become 
the largest foreign bank, followed by HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank in 
Taiwan. The  subsequent  impact  posed  to  the  consumer  banking  market  is 
worthy of close attention.In  consideration  of  the  lowest  tax  system  in  the  world,  Taiwan's 
government has announced the implementation of policies on repatriation of 
overseas  funds  to  Taiwan,  and  provided  production  resources  and  tax 
incentives  to  solicit  Taiwanese  businessmen  to  repatriate  their  personal  or 
corporate overseas funds back to Taiwan and transfer of their overseas supply 
chain.  The  repatriated  fund  will  be  applied  to  satisfy  the  actual  industrial 
needs.  In  the  meantime,  for  the  asset  allocation  and  tax  planning  needs2derived  from  the  repatriated  fund,  the  Group  has  integrated  the  abundant 
resources  owned  by  its  subsidiaries  engaged  in  banking,  investment  trust, 
venture capital and insurance, in order to plan the funding program that may 
meet customers’ needs jointly.The  Bank  has  been  actively  enhancing  the  quality  and  diversity  of 
services  delivered  over  digital  channels  as  a  response  to  the  growing 
popularity  of  mobile  banking  and  increasing  competition  for  digital 
customers.  In  addition  to  improving  customer  experience,  the  Bank  also 
applies big data technology to analyze the customers’ needs and preferences 
timely.  In  response  to  the  epidemic  development,  the  Bank  develops  the 
remote  application  for  enrollment  into  insurance  programs,  in  order  to 
provide  customers  with  convenient  and  safe  service  without  needing  to 
contact  face  to  face. Therefore,  customers  may  keep  accessing  the  wealth 
management specialist's professional consulting services without needing to 
show up at the bank in person, whereby the impact posed by the epidemic 
may be mitigated.The Bank will strive to maintain consistency of its business performance, 
bring  more complete financial services and  account features  to customers, 
and  secure  deposit  source  while  at  the  same  time  developing  integrated 
investment solutions for customers of special needs, and take advantage of 
group synergy by cross-selling them through Cathay subsidiaries online as 
well as offline to attract new capital.■  The Bank had been able to maintain growth across all main businessactivities; key accomplishments are as follows:(I)  Consumer banking serviceThe  Bank  continues  to  improve  fundamental  services  to  customers  by 
adopting  a  needs-driven  approach.  With  a  comprehensive  network  of 
physical  and  digital  channels  available  at  disposal,  the  Bank  is  able  to 
introduce integrated financial services and the ultimate one-stop shopping 
experience for customers of various profiles. The epidemic condition was 
becoming  stable  domestically  in  the  2H  of  2021.  A  low-interest 
environment combined with the return of Taiwanese enterprises drove the 
booming real property business, in terms of quantity and price, and also 
increased  demand  for  consumer  banking  solutions. The  Bank  will  also 
continue  to  improve  the  service  procedures  and  experience  for  online 
investors. Consumer banking credit balance  as of the end of December 
2021 exhibited strong growth over 2020.1.  Deposit balance amounted to NT$2,870.7 billion at the end of 2021, 
up 11% compared to 2020; 75.21% of the NTD deposit balance were 
demand deposits.2.  At the end of December 2021, outstanding balance across mortgage 
products  (including:  home  equity  loan)  totaled  NT$858  billion,  up 
NT$73.8 billion or 9% from the end of 2020. Balance of personal loan 
products amounted to NT$117.5 billion, up NT$16.9 billion or 17%3from the end of 2020.(II)  Wholesale banking serviceGrowth  of  the  Bank's  wholesale  banking  remains  strong,  and  the  Bank 
continues its strategy of industry segment management while having the 
exclusive  wholesale  banking service team offer  the integrated one-stop 
financial service to satisfy the needs of different customers. Meanwhile, 
support  of  group  resources  helps  improve  the  efficiency  of  business 
expansion efforts and maintain proper risk-return balance. As of the end 
of December 2021, the wholesale banking loan balance across domestic 
channels amounted to NT$531.9 billion.(III)  Wealth management serviceThe Bank delivers wealth management services with a “customer-centric” 
philosophy and takes the initiative to learn customers’ needs. Given the 
volume of misinformation circulating in the financial  market, the Bank 
combines  its  market  analysis  and  investment  strategies  to  provide 
professional wealth management consulting services and asset allocation 
programs, and also enhances the control over customers’ investment risk 
to  promote  the  health  of  customers’  wealth  management  positions. 
Differentiated  products  are  offered  to  the  investment  needs  of  high  net 
worth customers, and a team of professionals is assembled to provide tax 
and  wealth  transfer  plans.  Additionally,  the  Bank  also  continues  to 
develop  the  online  wealth  management  business  and  improve  the 
procedure for trading products over digital channels. Wealth management 
customers increased 11% in size and 14% in assets under management in 
2021. Overall, the Bank was able to sustain growth of income from wealth 
management services.(IV)  Trust serviceAUM  of  real  estate  trusts  totaled  NT$73.6  billion,  up  20%  from  2020, 
whereas AUM  of  personal  and  corporate  trusts  amounted  to  NT$59.7 
billion. Total assets under custody amounted to NT$1,026 billion.(V)  Foreign currency service1.  The  Bank  has  been  active  in  the  establishment  of  correspondence 
banking relations in ASEAN and Greater China regions as a means to 
support international businesses and facilitate more efficient transfer 
of capital in Asia. In the presence of a strong correspondence banking 
network, the Bank is able to appeal to a larger number of customers 
by introducing competitive remittance solutions and trade financing 
products, and thereby secure the foundation of success in the foreign 
currency market.2.  Despite  the  challenging  global  environment,  the  Bank  has  been 
focusing  on  growing  its  foreign  currency  service.  Using  pattern 
analysis,  the  Bank  was  able  to  strengthen  relationships  across  all 
customer  segments  for  mutual  benefit.  Foreign  currency  deposit4balance  amounted  to  US$23.1  billion  in  2021,  up  9%  compared  to 
2020.(VI)  Credit card service1.  The Bank had 7.6 million outstanding cards at the end of December 
2021, while the number of active cards reached 5.43 million and the 
total credit card spending amounted to NT$507.3 billion during the 
year,  increasing  by  3%  year-on-year  due  to  the  increasingly  stable 
COVID-19 epidemic.2.  The  Bank  issued  the  brand  new  credit  card,  CUBE  card  in August, 
which developed the innovative combination of product privilege and 
discretionary  selection  of  the  online  banking  APP  conversion 
program. In other words, only one single card could satisfy multiple 
needs. Meanwhile, it is tied with the reward point loyalty plan to lay 
the  foundation  for  Cathay  reward  point  ecology  platform,  so  as  to 
practice  the  streamlining  and  diversification  of  financial  products, 
improve  consumers’  experience,  satisfy  the  needs  for  living 
consumption and upgrade customers’ activeness.3.  As the COVID-19 epidemic is still raging in the world, the Bank uses 
the  best  effort  to  promote  the  digitalization  of  business  procedures 
and also drive the marketing based on data in order to control changes 
in  customers’  needs  more  precisely,  better  understand  customers’ 
preference  on  channels,  contact  points  and  needs,  construct  the 
optimal loyal customer cultivation plan, verify customers’ decision-
making  models  and  create  the  best  experience  for  customers. 
Meanwhile,  the  Bank  cooperates  with  merchants  to  integrate  both 
parties’ data to create mutual benefits for each other. It also deepens 
the transactions with the Group to introduce more customer bases to 
maximize  the  value  of  customer  management  and  turn  the  crisis 
posed  by  the  epidemic  into  opportunities  to  help  increase  the 
operating revenue again.4.  In order to deal with the reform resulting from the contactless digital 
transformation  accelerated  in  the  post-epidemic  era,  the  Bank  has 
already established the digital financial ecological system dedicated 
to providing merchants with precise big data analysis on consumers’ 
preferences,  soliciting  for  horizontal  alliance  and  differentiated 
marketing  cooperation.  The  Bank  also  focuses  on  the  membership 
management  for  analysis,  observes  the  business  opportunities  for 
cooperation with merchants, and thinks out of the box to improve the 
diversified  cooperation  with  merchants,  in  order  to  solicit  the 
customer base which the Bank had no way to reach and to expand the 
business penetration rate.(VII) Payment service1.  Transaction  acquisition  service:  Certain  important  channels  joined 
the Bank in 2021, including New Focus Richahaus Limited, Lavender5Cottage, and KW2 (renewed). Meanwhile, in 1H of 2021, the Bank 
started to increase the transaction acquisition service fees for foreign 
credit cards to increase the revenue from service fees. The Bank also 
completed  the  acquisition  of  automation  infrastructure.  As  of 
December 2021, the Bank had contracted with 88,929 merchants.2.  New  payment  service:  The  Bank  works  with  the  large-size  chain 
stores, such as Costco, Pxmart, 7-11 and FamilyMart, to provide the 
channel membership and mobile payment services, thereby causing 
the card binding and transactions to keep growing. In 2021, the Bank 
also implemented the digital credit card application service into the 
APPs  of  7-11  and  FamilyMart,  so  that  the  channel  members  may 
apply  for  the  Bank's  credit  cards  directly  via  the  APPs  they  use 
regularly.  Besides,  after  the  rapid  underwriting,  they  may  add  the 
virtual credit card to their wallets on the channel, so as to realize the 
interdisciplinary financial ecosystem physically.3.  Automated channels service: In addition to maintaining an exclusive 
presence  at  Taipei  Metro  Stations,  the  Bank  uses  the  best  effort  to 
expand its service reach to the fine-quality channels, such as Hi-Life, 
Pxmart  and  FamilyMart,  and  also  engages  in  partnerships  to  create 
new services to provide customers with more rapid financial services. 
Despite the impact posed by the epidemic, there were still more than 
15 million transactions completed using ATMs in 2021. The Bank had 
5,000 ATMs deployed nationwide, representing a 15% market share 
and ranking 2nd in the industry.(VIII) Digital banking service1.  Website: In order to build the Cathay brand identity, the website, as a 
digital gateway to solicit customers, provides streamlined, mobile and 
cross-channel  contents  to  upgrade  the  sales  and  guides,  and  highly 
integrates the official website and online banking webpage to make 
the access uninterrupted.2.  Online  banking App:  Through  the  integration  of  online  and  offline 
services  and  by  leveraging  the  advantages  of  digital  channels,  the 
users have attained 4 million persons and there were even more than 
1  million  logins  in  one  single  day.  Given  the  great  leap  in  the 
investment services, the Bank sorted the information and revised the 
interface  with  respect  to  Overview,  Subscription  for  Funds  and 
Search  functions.  Meanwhile,  the  Bank  worked  with  Cathay 
Securities to launch the online securities account opening service and 
order  placing  services  for  systematic  investment  in TAIEX  and  US 
stocks,  in  order  to  provide  users  with  a  more  comprehensive 
experience  in  investment;  add  the  sub-account  opening  and  target 
savings  setting  functions  to  satisfy  the  needs  for  personal  funding 
planners; expand video service application scenario, add designated 
fund transfer services, personal information modification and account 
opening verification services; launch the CUBE card to advance card6holders’ experience, and also provide the one-stop services covering 
online application, card activation and conversion programs.3.  KOKO APP:  Having  observed  young  customers’  lifestyles,  habits, 
and  financial  product  needs,  the  Bank  enhanced  the  functions  of 
account and credit card services and launched the online activation 
services for payment in installments, credit card information search 
and mobile cash withdrawal, in order to provide the users with more 
perfect digital experience; integrated the user name and password of 
online banking APP and KOKO App, so that KOKO users could log 
into the two platforms with the same user name and password at the 
same  time  and  access  more  services  and  functions  across  the 
platforms, only after completing the simple setting steps. Meanwhile, 
optimizations were made to existing functions to ensure a smoother 
digital experience.(IX)  Overseas operationsThe  Bank  places  significant  emphasis  on  Greater  China  Region  and 
Southeast Asia markets, and invests actively to capitalize on growth and 
opportunities within Asia Pacific. In the Greater China market, the Bank’s 
mainland  subsidiary  continued  to  enforce  a  localized  business  strategy 
and support top-performing Taiwanese enterprises. Through customized 
offerings,  professional  services,  and  cross-selling  efforts,  the  Bank 
actively  promotes  RMB-denominated  financial  products  as  a  means  to 
strengthen  attachment  with  its  target  customers.  Meanwhile,  the  Hong 
Kong  Branch remains  focused on  growing wholesale banking, treasury 
and  private  banking  services  through  cross-border  collaboration.  In 
Southeast  Asia,  the  Bank  currently  has  branch  establishments  in  9 
countries  including  Vietnam,  Cambodia,  Singapore,  Malaysia,  the 
Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia, making it the most 
widely established Taiwanese bank in Southeast Asia. The Yangon Office 
in Myanmar received approval to convert into Yangon Branch in 2020, 
and opened for business on January 8, 2021. Until the end of 2021, the 
Bank has owned 67 business locations in the Greater China and ASEAN 
regions, including 2 wholly owned subsidiary banks, 1 joint venture bank,

border  financial  platform  and  banking  network  that  spans  Taiwan,  the 
Greater China Region, and ASEAN, the Bank is able to integrate group

environment, and overall business environment(I)  External competitionThe  persisting  competition  between  China  and  the  USA,  tightened 
industrial  regulatory  measures  implemented  in  China,  port  congestion  and 
shortage  of  labor  and  containers  are  affecting  the  global  supply  chain. 
Besides, the factors such as the U.S.A acceleration of its QE tapering policy, 
uncertain  monetary  policies  of  multiple  countries’  central  banks,  and  the 
political risks between Russia and Ukraine, are also affecting investment and 
trade.  Further,  given  the  COVID-19  epidemic  is  still  raging,  even  if  oral 
medicine comes out and vaccination is prevailing day by day, the emerging 
variant virus limits the economic recovery strength.launchedIn order to deal with the impact posed by the epidemic on the economy, 
various  countries’  central  banks  have 
the  QE  policy. 
Notwithstanding,  given  the  sluggish  epidemic,  successive  lifting  of  the 
lockdown policy and prevailing vaccination rate, the matured markets have 
recovered  and  are  still  growing.  Notwithstanding,  the  pressure  from 
increasing inflation causes the main central banks to tighten their monetary 
policies, thus increasing the volatility in the market. The Bank will focus on 
the stability of customers’ asset allocation. When helping customers seize the 
investment opportunities, the Bank will also help them mitigate the overall 
volatility in their investment portfolio so that they may establish diversified 
and  volatility-resistant  asset  allocation  to  respond  to  the  volatility  in  the 
financial market.Notwithstanding, Taiwan's Central Bank maintains the same interest rate 
but  strengthens  the  optional  credit  controls  to  control  the  risk  over  loans 
secured  by  real  estate.  In  the  domestic  market,  the  domestic  demand  and 
private investment performance is outstanding, and export sales are benefited 
from economies’ successive activation of economic activities. The economic 
outlook is optimistic for 2022.Taiwan  has  abundant  liquidity  in  its  financial  system,  but  local  banks 
have been operating in an environment characterized by low margin, over-
competition,  and  excessive  competitors  for  extended  periods  of  time.  To 
prevent engaging in all-out price competition, the Bank continues to innovate 
with the help of digital tools and strives to provide business customers with 
financial services that  address a wide range of needs. This effort is further 
supported  with  tightened  control  over  credit  position  and  limited  capital, 
which  enable  the  Bank  to  grow  while  maintaining  sound  asset  quality  and 
consistent revenues.Digital  banking  service  have  changed  conventional  banking  and 
marketing practices, and fueled the growth of virtual channels to the extent 
that physical branches are being forced to undergo transformation. Today, it 
is  necessary  for  banks  to  invest  into  the  creation  of  an  online  banking 
environment and to guide branches toward transformation, while at the same20time cater for customers’ experience and transaction security. Technologies 
have already changed the ways of the financial industry, and uprise of virtual 
and  cloud-based  services  is  believed  to  disrupt  the  competitive  landscape 
even further, making FinTech companies the primary competitor.The rapid evolution of FinTech has driven the emerging business models. 
Inspired  by  the  strategic  thoughts,  namely  “digital  transformation”  and 
“smart  service  and  process  automation,”  the  financial  market  also  suffers 
structural changes. For example, online-only banks launched into the digital 
financial  battle,  and  large-size  financial  institutions  have  built  their 
ecosystems  successively.  Meanwhile,  the  emerging  COVID-19  epidemic 
also  accelerated  the  transformation  into  online  and  contactless  financial 
services.  Financial  service  providers  need  to  improve  the  digital  financial 
development  speed  and  strength,  and  also  deal  with  opportunities  and 
challenges more resiliently and rapidly.(II)  The regulatory environmentThe Bank conducts security assessments on all computer systems used 
in domestic and overseas branches/divisions to enhance security and conform 
to regulatory requirements. An independent consultant has been engaged to 
evaluate information security throughout the Bank, and the outcome of the 
evaluation, along with the Statement of Internal Control, are presented to the 
Board of Directors. The Bank expects to include information security into its 
corporate  culture  thoroughly,  and  practice  and  improve  the  information 
security protection power.The  Bank  hasinternal  policies,internal  control  measures, 
regular/irregular  training  programs,  compliance  self-assessment  practices 
and appointment of an independent third party to conduct a special audit on 
the AML/CFT mechanism in place to address key issues such as fair customer 
treatment,  anti-money  laundering  &  countering  of  terrorism  financing 
(AML/CTF),  corporate  social  responsibilities  etc.  for  compliance  with 
external  regulations.  Compliance  awareness  is  being  promoted  to  all 
employees within the Bank, and all issues relevant to the Bank’s operations 
are covered by internal control and compliance systems.In terms of financial supervision, financial institutions continue to face 
challenges from the introduction of new regulatory requirements, including 
AML/CTF.  As  the  growth  and  strategies  of  the  world’s  businesses  are 
influenced by “green finance,” financial service providers will have to shift 
their  investment  focus  towards  zero  emission  projects.  Furthermore, 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks will have to be taken into 
account as part of their credit assessment and supervision efforts, in order to 
urge financial institutions to drive the ESG targets. The Bank will continue 
to  strengthen  the  risk  governance  and  corporate  governance  and  include 
various countries’ regulatory requirements in line with the international trend, 
in order to ensure financial stability and consumers’ interests and rights.21The impact posed by amendments to product design rules to the products 
is amplified. Insofar as the legal compliance and business risk are balanced, 
the  Bank  will  use  the  best  effort  to  grow  its  business  stably  to  expand  the 
income.Tightened  regulations  on  investment-linked  policies  (or  policies  with 
guaranteed  payouts):  The  higher  expense  ratio  and  reduced  policies  with 
guaranteed payouts lower the product attractiveness.Use  of  the  6th  Mortality  Table:  The  6th  Mortality  Table  can  better 
demonstrate  the  current  nationals’  life  expectancy.  Though  the  survival 
benefit insurance premium (such as medical insurance) would be increased 
accordingly, the policy conditions would be more favorable to customers of 
high-protection multiple life insurance products, thus helpful for the Bank to 
promote its insurance operations.(III) The overall business environmentIn 2021, the global economy and industry were still suffering from the 
impact posed by the COVID-19 epidemic. Given the vaccine coming out in 
1H of 2021, various countries have successively lifted their control policies, 
thus  driving  the  global  market  demand. As  far  as  financial  institutions  are 
concerned,  their  domestic  and  overseas  business  have  to  deal  with  a  huge 
challenge. The effects it had on the supply chain and demands have increased 
credit default risk for banks. Although the government of Taiwan responded 
with relief measures and interest rate cuts in line with Europe and USA, the 
ongoing  spread  of  COVID-19  still  presents  financial  institutions  with 
additional  liquidity  risk  and  credit  risk,  and  undermines  the  confidence  of 
local investors and consumers, as well as the growth of Taiwan’s economy.Due  to  the  impact  posed  by  the  COVID-19,  customers  tend  to  avoid 
physical contact and, therefore, the tangible orders are decreasing. The Bank 
continues to strengthen its digital channels for wealth management and uses 
the best effort to develop the remote application for enrollment into insurance 
programs,  in  order  to  provide  customers  with  convenient  and  safe  service 
without  needing  to  contact  face  to  face.  Therefore,  customers  may  keep 
accessing  the  wealth  management  specialist's  professional  consulting 
services  without  needing  to  show  up  at  the  bank  in  person,  whereby  the 
impact posed by the epidemic may be mitigated.Despite the global continuing economic recovery, the economic outlook 
still  needs  to  deal  with  the  downside  risks  including  raging  variant  virus, 
hindrance  by  the  supply  chain  bottleneck  and  increasing  commodity  price 
index.  The  Bank  will  strive  to  maintain  consistency  of  its  business 
performance, bring more complete financial services and account features to 
customers,  secure  deposit  source,  and  optimize  customer  experience.  The 
Bank also aims to develop integrated investment solutions for customers of 
special  needs,  and  take  advantage  of  group  synergy  by  cross-selling  them 
through Cathay subsidiaries online as well as offline to attract new capital.22VI.  Credit ratingInstitution for credit

Commercial Bank” (UWCCB) and “Cathay Commercial Bank.” The former of 
the founding members (UWCCB) was founded in September 1971 during the 4th 
Cathay Financial Association Gathering, where members and overseas Chinese 
leaders representing Chinese businesses from 17 countries and regions worldwide 
gathered  and  founded  a  new  banking  establishment  out  of  commitment  to 
supporting economic growth in the home country,  with all 17  members of The 
Bankers  Association  of  Taipei  each  contributing  50%  of  capital.  During  the 
founders’ meeting held in May 1974, a resolution was passed to set share capital 
at US$12  million; 50% of which was allocated to domestic shareholders while 
another  50%  was  allocated  to  overseas  shareholders.  In  December  1974,  the 
Executive  Yuan  approved  UWCCB’s  license  application  submitted  through 
Ministry of Finance, and UWCCB later commenced official business activities 
on  May  20,  1975  at  No.  10  Yongsui  Street,  Taipei  City.  On  April  17,  1995, 
UWCCB  merged  “Overseas  Chinese  Trust  and  Investment  Co.,  Ltd.”  into  its 
organization.The latter of the founding members (Cathay Commercial Bank) was initially 
founded as “First Trust and  Investment  Co.,  Ltd.” in June 1971. The board re-
election held in 1993 elected Mr. Chen-Yu Tsai as the chairman of First Trust and 
Investment, who introduced a “5-year transformation program” that successfully 
re-organized  the  institution  into  “Huitong  Commercial  Bank  Co.,  Ltd.”  on 
November 16, 1998. On July 3, 2002, Huitong Commercial Bank Co., Ltd. was 
renamed “Cathay Commercial Bank.”As a response to ongoing changes such as the government’s financial reform 
initiative, 
the  implementation  of  Financial  Holding  Company  Act  and 
intensifying  competition  from  financial  conglomerates  after  joining  the  World 
Trade  Organization,  Cathay  Commercial  Bank  and  UWCCB  joined  Cathay 
Financial  Group  and  became  100%-owned  subsidiaries  of  Cathay  Financial 
Holding  Co.,  Ltd.  (Cathay  Financial  Holdings)  on April  22  and  December  18, 
2002, respectively, to provide more complete financial services to a wider range 
of  customers.  A  decision  was  later  made  to  merge  UWCCB  and  Cathay 
Commercial Bank according to The Financial Institutions Merger Act and related 
laws, with UWCCB being the surviving company and Cathay Commercial Bank 
the dissolved company. Merging had a number of advantages such as integrated 
resource, reduced cost, enhanced performance, improved service and creation of 
synergy. Terms and details of the merger agreement were passed during the board 
of  directors  meeting  held  on April  21,  2003,  and  were  later  approved  by  the24Ministry of Finance on June 26. The merger baseline date was set on October 27, 
2003, from which time the surviving entity was renamed Cathay United Bank Co., 
Ltd.To  ensure  further  growth  in  terms  of  service  scope  and  market  share,  the 
Bank later  merged with Lucky  Bank (January  1, 2007 being  the baseline date) 
and acquired a certain part of assets, liabilities, and business activities from China 
United Trust  &  Investment  Corporation  on  December  29,  2007.  Following  the 
merger, the Bank was able to increase the domestic branch count to 165.25I.OrganizationOrganization and responsibilities of main departmentsThree.  Corporate Governance Report26II.

included  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  to  the  Bank’s  directors, 
supervisors,  President,  and  Executive  Vice  Presidents,  and  their  respective 
proportions  to  net  income,  as  well  as  the  policies,  standards,  and  packages  by 
which  they  were  paid,  the  procedures  through  which  remunerations  were 
determined, and their association with business performance and future risks:69The  sum  of  remuneration  paid  to  directors,  supervisors,  President  and 
Executive Vice  Presidents  in  2021  amounted  to  NT$322,269,000  (representing 
1.35% of net income in 2021), down 1.30% from the NT$326,499,000 reported 
in 2020. The basis of remuneration disclosed above is different from the basis of 
the  Income  Tax Act;  for  this  reason,  the  amount  has  been  prepared  solely  for 
information disclosure, and not for tax purpose.1.  Remuneration  to  directors,  supervisors  and  managers  are  determined 
according to the Bank’s “Director and Supervisor Compensation Guidelines” 
and “Manager Compensation Guidelines”; both policies have been resolved 
in  board  meetings.  Amount  of  remuneration 
is  decided  based  on 
responsibilities,  capacity  and  annual  performance  of  each  individual,  while 
taking into consideration the benchmark level. Both the remuneration policy 
and  amount  are  adjusted  according  to  current  and  future  risks  and  overall 
business  performance  to  ensure  alignment  with  shareholders’  long-term 
interest.2.  In the “Director and Supervisor Compensation Guidelines” (referred to as the 
“Guidelines” below), a director’s compensation includes fees, remuneration, 
and traffic and other allowances.(1)  Compensation:  The  Bank  may  compensate  directors(including 
Chairman/Vice Chairman) who personally participate in the execution of 
business activities. The amount of which is determined based on level of 
participation and contribution of individual directors and peer levels, and 
are  paid  with  board  of  directors’  approval.  These  directors  may  also 
receive bonus at managers’ rate depending on annual performance.Compensation for independent directors and external directors appointed 
by  the  parent  company  is  evaluated  according  to  rules  of  the  parent 
company; directors who concurrently assume managerial position within 
the Bank are not entitled to compensation.(2)  Remuneration: In profit-making years, the Bank may pay out no more than 
0.1%  of  earnings  as  remuneration  to  directors  and  supervisors  (i.e.  the 
parent company).(3)  Transportation and other allowances are paid at the standards stated in theGuidelines.3.  The  Bank  has  “Manager  Compensation  Guidelines”  in  place  that  outlinesmanagers’ monthly salary, allowance, bonus and retirement benefits.The board of directors of Indovina Bank convenes meetings at least four 
times a year. Given Indovina Bank’s stature as a Vietnam-registered subsidiary 
jointly controlled by Industrial and Commercial Bank of Vietnam (50%), the 
Bank  respects  the  decisions  of  its  Vietnamese  partner  on  related  issues, 
including director remuneration, provided that such decisions are fair and do 
not adversely impact the shareholders’ interest.70IV.Implementation of Corporate Governance(I)  Operation of the Board of Directors (Table 2)A total of 8 meetings (A) were held in the last year (2021); below are directors’ and

Performance Evaluation Principles,” the board of directors is subject to performance 
assessment  once  a  year.  The  2021  assessment  found  the  board  having  performed 
“Above  Standard,”  and  the  outcome  was  reported  during  board  meeting.  Board 
member performance evaluation rules and methods have been established according 
to  “Director  and  Supervisor  Performance  Evaluation  Policy”;  the  Bank  examines 
performance of board members on a yearly basis.Execution of Board Performance EvaluationAssessment cycleAssessmentScope ofAssessmentAssessment details(Note 1)duration

of internal control.(2)  Director individual performance assessment: director’s awareness toward the Bank’s goals and missions, 
awareness to duties, level of participation in the Bank’s operations, maintenance of internal relations and 
communication, professionalism and ongoing education, and enforcement of internal control.(3)  Performance assessment for functional committees: participation in the Bank’s operations, awareness to 
duties, quality of committee’s decisions, composition and member selection, and enforcement of internal79control.IV.  Enhancement to functionality of the board of directors in the current and the most 
recent year (e.g. establishment of an Audit Committee, improvement of information 
transparency, etc.), and the progress of such enhancements.The Bank has undertaken a number of governance enhancement actions in line with 
the  corporate  governance  roadmap  published  by  the  Financial  Supervisory 
Commission. For example: a Corporate Sustainability (CS) task force comprising 
representatives from various departments and offices has been assembled to enforce 
corporate social responsibilities; a corporate governance officer has been appointed 
to assist board members with various duties; and changes in regulations are being 
monitored closely and reflected in internal policies in a timely manner to support 
the Bank’s corporate governance efforts.  Enhancement of board performance  Board  meetings  are  being  held  more  frequently  and  more  efficiently  toaccommodate the Bank’s growing size and businesses.  In  order  to  build  the  Bank’s  “Accountability”  core  spirit  effectively,  the 
“Accountability Committee” was established under the Board of Directors in 2021.  A set of “Board of Directors and Functional Committee Performance Evaluation 
Principles” was established in 2018 to support the Bank’s corporate governance 
efforts and to improve the efficiency of the board and functional committees, based 
on the ways they operate. The Bank expressly defined the five major evaluation 
indicators, including “participation in the company’s operation,” “improvement of 
the  Board  of  Directors’  (functional  committees’)  decision  quality,”  and 
“composition  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (functional  committees),”  “election  and 
ongoing education of the directors (functional committee members)” and “internal 
controls.”  The  board  performance  evaluation  should  be  conducted  once  a  year. 
The  outcomes  of  the  2021  board  performance  evaluation  have  been  reported 
during the board meeting held on January 26, 2022, and ongoing efforts will be 
made to improve performance targets and the board’s operation. Furthermore, the 
Bank engaged an independent third party to evaluate performance of the board of 
directors  in  2020  out  of  concerns  for  the  independence  and  efficiency  of  the 
evaluation process. The institution offers professional insight to various aspects 
including  corporate  governance  and  operations  that  helps  board  members 
supervise more effectively to ensure accomplishment of sustainability goals.  During the meeting held in March 2019, the Bank’s board of directors passed a 
resolution  to  appoint  a  “Corporate  Governance  Officer”  to  oversee  corporate

Other information material to the understanding of the ESG practices:(I)  The Bank was the first in the industry to contribute to the field of art, starting with the establishment of the Culture and Charity Foundation of the 
Cathay United Bank in 1980, followed by the founding of the Cathay United Art Center in 2000. Driven by its mission to “give back to society,” 
the Bank has promoted the education and charity business proactively through the Foundation, including education for children and juveniles, 
charity activity, art & culture activity and other sponsorships, to fulfill its corporate social responsibility. The Foundation’s major activities are 
briefed as follows:1.  Education for children and juvenile:(1)  Elevated Tree Program－Grow A Big Tree From A Shoot:Continue to promote the "Elevated Tree Program" to root the education and help the child students learn without worry, train their self-
confidence and develop their future. The “Elevated Tree Program Scholarship” implemented in 2021 has assisted a total 6,784 
disadvantaged child students in paying their tuition and miscellaneous expenses, processing fees and after-school program fees.In order to extend the spirit of the Elevated Tree Program - Grow A Big Tree From A Shoot, the Bank also encouraged students to engage 
in physical education activities in 2021. The “Elevated Tree Program - Physical Education Donation” was applied to support elementary 
schools’ and junior high schools’ promotion of the physical education spirit, train child students’ self-discipline and teamwork, and help 
them discover themselves through participation in large-size sports games.In 2021, the Bank sponsored 10 sports teams, including the soccer team of Nantou County Shuili Elementary School, for participation in107Implementation itemsYes  NoSummaryImplementation StatusDeviation(s) fromSustainableDevelopment BestPractice Principles for

National Juvenile Soccer Competition.”(2)  Activities co-organized by Cathay Charity Group:The Bank participated in “Cathay Scholarship,” “Teach For Taiwan (TFT),” “Cathay Dream Come True Project for Child Students,” 
“After-School Care Program in Rural Areas” and “Giving Winter Warmth,” and was involved in the preparation of Cathay Charity Group 
annual report.2.  Art and cultural events:Based on the core philosophy of support for the local arts and promotion of art education, Cathay United Art Center organizes the art 
exhibitions and seminars periodically to provide Taiwan’s artists with the stage for their performance and also enable the public to have the 
chance to appreciate, and learn from, the arts without charge. Due to the raging epidemic, only 5 art exhibitions and 5 art lectures were 
organized in 2021. Meanwhile, in response to Cathay Arts Festival, the new century potential painting was exhibited. Further, it also designed 
Cathay Financial Group’s art calendar based on the theme “Finding the Light, Finding the Future”, in order to promote the beauty of the good 
deed.3.  Charity and sponsored activities:In order to extend the care for indigenous people and social & business development, in 2021, the Bank procured the homemade products from 
the “Down Syndrome Foundation of the R.O.C.,” “Yu-cheng Social Welfare Foundation” and “Pingtung Christian Bethany Home (PCBH),” 
out of the intent to create the demand and supply through the procurement project and also the revenue for the social welfare organizations;

TWSE/TPEx ListedCompanies andReason(s)provide various training channels for employee empowerment, and train various emerging skills, in order to ensure that the employees may grow 
with the company together in the mid of digital wave. Cathay believes that youth empowerment may lay the foundation for society’s progress. In 
order to shorten the divide between higher education and the job market for the youth and train their soft/hard power in workplaces, the Bank 
works with various colleges/universities throughout Taiwan to provide multiple industry-academia cooperation projects and internship projects 
that may help improve the youth’s competitiveness in workplaces. The Bank took the initiative to establish the “Southeast Asia industry-academia 
cooperation master program” and “International CMA,” to reserve the local students in Southeast Asia through the industry-academia cooperation, 
from life to financial talent training, so as to establish a stable source of professionals, integrate with the occupational empowerment and youth 
empowerment, provide employment opportunities and mitigate inequality.(III)  The Bank continues to promote inclusive financial education, by publishing research reports and investment insights on its official website 
periodically. The Bank also accelerates the digitalized applications and produces diversified content subject to the different generation and 
attributes of customers, e.g. online forums, seminars, and audiovisual programs, and invite domestic/overseas renowned masters to share their 
views and open the seminars to the public online for free. Meanwhile, the Bank would also work with external renowned financial and economic 
bloggers and talk shows to communicate the correct wealth management concepts and financial knowledge, in order to improve the nationals’ 
financial literacy and mitigate financial weakness.(IV)  For the consumer banking services, the Bank has promoted the whole online credit loan services since 2017, and expanded the scope ofapplicability to provide more diversified and robust online financial services year by year. In April 2021, the Bank received the “Carbon Footprint 
Label” for the “personal unsecured loan service” from the Environmental Protection Administration, Executive Yuan, ahead of the others in the 
industry. Then, it attained the target of carbon emission by 3% and received the “Carbon Footprint Reduction Label” at the same time within one 
year. All of these reflect the specific efforts it made to mitigate the effects posed by climate change.(V)  Below is a summary of main environmental protection events the Bank had organized in 2021:1.  The President succeeded in assuming the responsibility for KPI zero-carbon target, and led the staff to achieve the target jointly. He alsopromised to attain the RE100 in 2030.2.

The Bank responds to the green consumption cycle philosophy promoted by the Environmental Protection 
Administration, urging the staff to participate in the environmental protection reward points collection activity to make the “green 
consumption” become a part of their life. The Bank organizes the charity bazaar for second-hand sales to reduce the waste from the source and 
respond to the green life initiative.(VI)  Below is a summary of main health promotion events the Bank had organized in 2021:1.  Cathay Financial Group organized a “Weight Loss Program” to promote healthy lifestyles, proper exercise habits, and a healthy diet, and 
thereby improving the health and energy of its employees. The Bank’s employees achieved a total weight loss of 2.3 tonnes, for which the 
financial holding company made a donation of NT$100 per KG (no more than NT$2 million) to charity causes. The Bank will continue 
working with the Group to promote the health of its employees in the future.2.  In response to the Group’s policy, the Bank uses the best effort to work on the green operation and construction of a sustainable homeland. In2021 when the epidemic became sluggish, the Bank continued to respond to the environmental initiatives, organized the beach cleaning 
activity to combine the family environmental education, and also invited suppliers to participate in the activity altogether to fight for the 
environmental protection. The three beach cleaning events were attended by more than 200 participants including the employees of Cathay 
United Bank and their family members, and also suppliers. The marine litters totaling 171KG have been cleaned.3.  The Bank organized its “2021 Blood Donation” event and invited participation from employees, customers and the general public.

This event not only brought businesses closer to the people, but also raised the public’s awareness toward health and social engagement.4.  The Company has been organizing a Working Mother Protection Program since June 2016 to support maternal health. The program not onlyoffers employees the benefit to apply for childcare concessions, but also uses questionnaires to evaluate employees’ childcare needs and 
provide relevant assistance. A total of 219 pregnant employees applied for maternal concessions, while 179 female employees applied for post-
labor concessions and 81 male employees applied for parental concessions in 2021.(VII) With the construction of the branches’ automatic service areas and online banking facility, and installation of iPad devices, the automatic serviceexperience of customers is improved, which also provides guidance to customers in the application and use of digital functions. In addition, the 
objective of customers’ use of digital instruments is improved, such that paper use quantity is reduced, and the carbon emission due to 
transportation necessary for customers to travel to the counter for transactions in person can be reduced, thereby achieving contributions to the 
mitigation of SDG climate change. A total of 165 branches were all staffed with guidance specialists and also equipped with accessibility service 
counters to assist the physical disabled in various financial services. Among the other things 109 branches out of them also provided the ATMs 
applicable to citizens moving with wheelchairs.(VIII) The branches’ power conservation challenges have helped conserve the power by about 590,000 kWh compared to the same period last year. Byvirtue of the visual energy management system, the Bank monitored the power status of equipment after work and promoted the branches’ 
improvement. It has completed the marking of an air-conditioning zone in 33 branches (expected to complete the marking in the remaining 132 
branches in 2022) to help the branches save power.(IX)  The selection of relocation subject matter of the Bank and the planning of decoration of branches are required to comply with fire control andbuilding related laws and regulations, and such selection and planning are made based on the consideration of avoiding social concerns, cultural 
asset or world heritage sites and monuments or any disputable and sensitive subject matters.(X)In order to respond to the “2030 Bilingual National Policy Development Blueprint,” the Bank has completed the bilingual environmental facilities

and requirement of upfront payment for NT$999 only, with respect to the nationals who are about to attain 55 years old or above, in order to 
provide nationals with more convenience nursing service. Meanwhile, the Bank also continued to promote the trust planning in the community or 
via newspapers and media, and combined with trust services to encourage nationals to arrange for the trust planning as early as possible to prevent 
the financial exploitation, such as elderly scams, and aim to protect nationals’ financial security at old age.(XII)  1.

Analysis  of  location  of  business,  future  market  supply,  demand  andgrowth, and competition(1)  SupplyGiven  the  epidemic,  the  domestic  wealth  management  business  has 
accelerated  its digitalized  transformation.  Peers in the  same  industry  have 
also  strengthened  the  role  of  online  banks  successively.  The  Bank  will 
continue to build additional digital channels engaged in communication with 
customers, deliver the best end-to-end transaction experience for customers, 
verify  customers’  needs  and  preference,  and  provide  suitable  financial 
wealth management and insurance products and services. Coupled with the 
fact that the domestic  insurance  market is intensively competitive with an 
oversupply  of  highly  homogeneous  products,  the  Company  will  place 
greater emphasis on delivering professional services in line with customers’ 
needs.(2)  Demand and growthAccelerated  vaccination  has  also  relieved  the  economic  lockdown 
successively.  Therefore,  the  economic  is  recovering,  thus  helpful  for 
supporting  the  risk-based  assets’  performance,  improving  nationals’152investment and wealth  management needs and also  developing the  wealth 
management services.Due to restrictions of prevailing laws and the investment environment, 
the Company will focus on promoting the protective features of insurance. 
Meanwhile, customers’ needs will have to be analyzed in greater detail and 
addressed with total asset allocation solutions in order to increase attachment, 
revenue contribution, and customer management.(3)  Competitive advantageDue to saturation and high degree of homogeneity within the domestic 
financial market, it is necessary for banks to compete on financial innovation 
and  service  differentiation  in  the  future,  which  is  why  the  Bank  will  be 
forming  alliances  and  integrating  resources  with  partners  from  different 
industries to develop innovative practices that are different from traditional 
banking.  Backed  by  a  strong  customer  base  and  data  model  analysis 
technologies,  the  Bank  is  able  to  take  the  initiative  in  offering  investment 
solutions that meet customers’ needs. Meanwhile, the Bank adheres to the 
principles of stable  management to strengthen the control over customers’ 
investment risk, perfect the health of customers’ asset allocation, reduce the 
market volatility risk over investment positions and upgrade customers’ trust 
over time.The Bank actively explores expansion opportunities in Greater China 
and Southeast Asian  markets, sets up branches and divisions in 9  member 
states  of  ASEAN  and  establishes  fair  relationship  with  local  and 
multinational  excellent  enterprises,  and  Taiwanese  enterprises.  The  stable 
economic  growth  in  the  target  market,  sufficient  labor  force,  diversified 
industrial  structure  and  global  trade  network,  investment  in  infrastructure 
and digitalization, and increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) will drive 
the Bank’s continuing growth.The  Bank’s  overseas  market  expansion  efforts  have  been  largely 
focused  on  corporate  financing  and  related  products,  such  as:  syndicated 
lending, trade financing and cross-border corporate Internet banking, all of 
which  have  been  well-received  by  local  corporate  customers.  Besides,  in 
consideration  of  the changes in  consumption  types  in  the  market,  middle-
class  consumers  are  emerging  and  thereby  deliver  the  potential  growth 
opportunities  in  the  consumer  banking  market. The  Bank  will  serve  local 
customer bases with new products, new channels and new business models 
through  the  innovation  based  on  FinTech,  and  drive  co-marketing  of  the 
other local subsidiaries’ business to create consolidated effects for the Group.1532.  Future opportunities, threats, and response strategies(1)  Opportunities, threats and response strategies in Taiwan Opportunities① The  Bank  owns  the  financial  group's  resources  and  advantages, 
combines  the  professional  market  analysis  and  diversified  financial 
instruments and resources inside and outside the Group, and provides 
customers  with  new  wealth  management  products  and  strategic 
investment  orientation.  Besides,  the  Bank  is  exclusively  engaged  in 
sale  of  the  insurance  policies  of  Cathay  Life  and  Cathay  Century 
Insurance and, therefore, able to respond to any problems about design 
and  adjustment  of  products  more  quickly  than  peers  in  the  same 
industry  and  also  leverage  the  competitive  strengths  of  Cathay 
Financial Holdings’ platform effectively.② The Bank has had great success delivering complete digital financial 
services  to  customers  using  modern  technologies  and  a  digital 
platform  in  recent  years.  The  Bank  will  continue  to  optimize  the 
digital  channel  product  trading  procedure  and  expand  the  scope  of 
online  services  via  the  digital  platform,  combine  the  data  model  to 
explore  customers’  wealth  management  needs  and  deliver  the  best 
transaction experience for customers at the same time.③ The credit card market scale is still growing. Consumers have already 
been accustomed to the consumption with plastic money. Besides, the 
epidemic  drove  increasing  home  economy.  All  walks  of  life  have 
transformed into contactless electronic payment scenarios and online 
channels to strive for the delivery market. Large-size chain stores are 
investing in their private brand wallet and member APP, thus helping 
improve the utilization rate of mobile payment, accelerating nationals’ 
acceptance of various digital services, enabling banks, merchants and 
consumers  to  connect  with  each  other  more  closely,  and  also 
supplement  the  consumption  database,  thus  helpful  for  analysis  on 
customers’  needs  to  increase  the  opportunities  for  cross-selling  and 
horizontal alliance.④ The  Bank  operates  a  broad  network  of  automated  equipment  with 
extensive  customer  coverage,  thus  opening  up  opportunities  for 
financial service providers to grow.⑤ Looking forward to 2022, most research institutions believe that the 
global  economy  should  continue  recovering  and  the  supply  and 
demand  imbalance  issue  should  be  relieved,  with  the  international 
inflation  expected 
the 
challenges,  such  as  main  advanced  economies’  monetary  policy 
normalization,  changes  in  the  relationship  between  China  and  theto  become  sluggish.  Notwithstanding,154USA,  the  global  supply  chain  bottleneck  and  changeable  epidemic, 
still  remain  and  keep  affecting  the  growth  force.  Domestically,  the 
consumption demand was getting better in 2H of last year. The export 
of  electronic  and  semiconductor  products  was  booming.  Benefited 
from the global logistic demand, the shipping industry also delivered 
fair  business  performance.  Further,  the  inflation  rate  is  expected  to 
decline and economy expected to recover mildly this year, as indicated 
by  the  Central  Bank  at  its  recent  board  of  directors/supervisors 
meeting. Therefore, the policy-based interest rate remains unchanged, 
and  it  will  keep  observing  the  control  over  epidemic  to  help  the 
economic recovery in market. The Bank continues to monitor credit 
risks  and  industry  changes,  and  offers  diverse  financial  services 
without compromising asset quality as a means to improve business 
performance. Threats① Top 5 credit card issuing banks are offering credit cards packaged with 
high rewards or privileges and loyal customers management plan in 
an attempt to maintain market share, which soars competition of the 
banking  service  even  more.  Meanwhile,  credit  cards  are  now  used 
mostly  as  payment  tools,  and  low  utilization  of  the  credit  function 
caused a decline in profits. Continuing aggressive credit card reward 
marketing from peers have resulted in additional marketing costs and 
undermined profitability.② Considering  that  the  payment  tools  are  diversified  and  changeable 
rapidly, with high costs in updating equipment and competition from 
tangible  channels  and  e-commerce  dealers,  it  is  hard  to  expand  the 
non-cash market scale immediately and, therefore, the relevant service 
providers  have  to  compete  with  each  other  for  the  limited  customer 
base and consumption scenes. The payment market is still expected to 
be highly competitive in 2022.③ The  financial  market  is  already  overwhelmed  with  information  and 
homogeneous competition among peers and in regions. Besides, the 
epidemic  resulted  in  acceleration  of  digitalized  transformation,  and 
peers  in  the  same  industry  strengthened  the  role  of  online  banks 
successively, thus posing an even greater challenge to digital wealth 
management services.④ The  competent  authorities  havetightened  supervision  over 
reduced  policies  with 
investment-linked  payment  products, 
guaranteed  payouts,  and  forced  an  increase  in  premiums  that  may 
adversely affect sales. It would be more challenging to develop new 
investment-linked products that meet customers’ needs.⑤ Given  the  increasingly  tightened  financial  supervision  and  frequent155amendments  to  laws,  how  to  grow  business  and  revenues  while 
catering  for  business  risk  and  compliance  will  be  a  challenge  to  be 
dealt with by the financial industry.⑥ It is difficult for banks to enjoy excess profit margin due to saturation 
of  the  domestic  financial  market  and  the  prevailing  low-interest 
environment.  Furthermore,  given  the  rapid  changes  in  financial 
products  and  the  banking  environment,  banks  have  to  constantly 
adjust and adapt, which presents major challenge to future operations. Response measures① With the support of big data analysis, the Bank will aim to introduce 
new products and campaigns that give consumers the option to choose 
depending  on  their  needs  and  preferences,  and  in  doing  so  improve 
marketing yields, customer satisfaction, and attachment.② More attention will be directed towards digitalization of product and 
service  offerings  in  an  attempt  to  develop  the  young  digital  natives 
more  thoroughly  and  combine  diversified  lifestyle  scenes.  Make 
timely adjustments in response to the pandemic, and actively provide 
financial  services  with  differentiated  and  identifiable  innovations  as 
means  to  raise  the  Bank’s  brand  competitiveness.  Oriented  toward 
customer  experience  and  service,  make  early  preparation  for  post-
pandemic opportunities and avoid succumbing to price competition of 
the banking industry.③ The  innovative  payment  service  constitutes  a  part  of  the  banking 
services only. More diversified and complete financial services would 
be  provided  via  channels  continuously  to  deliver  more  innovative 
services to the channels’ members.④ Continually provide financial advisors with new product knowledge 
as  well  as  skills  to  help  customers  adjust  investment  strategies  and 
build  up  a  strong  portfolio;  actively  monitor  customers’  existing 
investment positions and enhance risk management over customers’ 
exposures.⑤ Embrace  the  challenges  of  digitalized  wealth  management  service 
with  a  “customer-centric”  philosophy,  verify  customers’  needs  and 
preference,  provide  suitable  financial  wealth  management  and 
insurance  products  and  services,  and  deliver  the  best  end-to-end 
transaction experience for customers.⑥ Strengthen  the  service  and  internal  controls  in  response  to  the 
increasingly tightened laws and regulations, continue to transform the 
product  sale  structure,  integrate  the  Group's  professional  resources 
and  develop  diversified  product  categories  to  cater  to  customers’ 
needs.156⑦ Integrating  across  devices,  platforms  and  physical/virtual  channels, 
provide  digital  cash 
service  and  enhance  account 
collection/payment  functions  to  become  the  customers’  primary 
banker.flow⑧ Make  optimal  use  of  existing  customer  base  and  physical  channels, 
and  intensify  intra-group  business  referral  in  ways  that  improve  the 
depth and breadth of relationship with top customers.⑨ The  financial  industry  remains  highly  competitive  while  the  three 
online-only banks are already approved to start operating. Given the 
ongoing changes in the business environment, banks are compelled to 
transform and adopt a higher level of digitalization and agility, which 
gives  rise  to  higher  demand  for  financial  data  analysts  and  strategy 
talents. The Bank will continue its talent training efforts and build the 
diversified  applications  of  information  technology  combining  with 
wholesale banking services, in order to secure the Bank's competitive 
advantages.(2)  Opportunities, threats and response strategies in overseas markets OpportunitiesThe Bank's target markets still presents significant business opportunities 
given their growth potentials and favorable conditions. ThreatsThe  increasingly  tightened  regulatory  standards  resulted  in  additional 
compliance costs, with economic growth sluggish due to the COVID-19 
epidemic, in various countries. Response measuresThe ongoing pandemic has resulted in the sluggish GDP growth across the 
Greater China Region and ASEAN members, and negatively impacted all 
professions  and  industries  around  the  world.  The  COVID-19  pandemic 
has profoundly changed people’s working and spending habits. The Bank 
has  boosted  the  digital  transformation  proactively  to  keep  the  financial 
services uninterrupted and continued to launch new financial products and 
services during the work from home (WFH) period. Meanwhile, the Bank 
has responded with progressive digitalization and enforced “localization 
strategies” at business locations where the pandemic is better controlled. 
By  consolidating  resources  across  non-life  insurance,  life  insurance, 
banking, and other subsidiaries of the group, projects such as data-driven 
customer  service,  smart  investment,  automated  process,  and  Equator 
Principles-compliant financing have been undertaken to enhance product 
development skills and satisfy customer’ needs with greater precision. By 
consistently  delivering  values  and  experiences  above  customers’ 
expectation,  the  Bank  has  secured  its  place  as  customers’  best  overseas157partner and the leading bank in Asia Pacific.158(V)  Research and development of new financial instruments1.  New financial instruments and business departments introduced in the last 2

Corporate responsibility and moral conductCathay Financial Group upholds the three major ESG axes, namely “Climate, 
Health and Empowerment.” Among the other things, the Bank continues to practice 
the  occupational  empowerment,  implement  diversified  and  inclusive  corporate 
culture  to  provide  friendly  workplaces,  provide  various  training  channels  for 
employee empowerment, and train various emerging skills, in order to ensure that 
the  employees  may  grow  with  the  company  together  in  the  mid  of  digital  wave. 
Cathay  believes  that  youth  empowerment  may  lay  the  foundation  for  society’s 
progress. In order to shorten the gap between higher education and the job market 
for the youth and train their soft/hard power in workplaces, the Bank works with 
various  colleges/universities  throughout  Taiwan  to  provide  multiple  industry-
academia cooperation  projects and internship projects that  may  help improve the 
youth’s competitiveness in workplaces. The Bank took the initiative to establish the 
“Southeast Asia industry-academia cooperation master program” and “International 
CMA,”  to  reserve  the  local  students  in  Southeast  Asia  through  the  industry-
academia cooperation, from life to financial talent training, so as to establish a stable 
source  of  professionals,  integrate  with  the  occupational  empowerment  and  youth 
empowerment, provide employment opportunities and mitigate inequality.The  Bank  was  the  pioneer  in  the  industry  to  contribute  to  the  field  of  art, 
starting with the establishment of the Culture and Charity Foundation of the Cathay 
United Bank in 1980, followed by the founding of the Cathay United Art Center in 
2000. Driven by its mission to “give back to society,” the Bank has promoted the 
education  and  charity  business  proactively  through  the  Foundation,  including 
education for children and juveniles, charity activity, art & culture activity and other 
sponsorships, to fulfill its corporate social responsibility. The Foundation’s major 
activities are briefed as follows:1. Education for children and juvenile:① Elevated Tree Program－Grow A Big Tree From A Shoot:Continue  to  promote  the  "Elevated Tree  Program"  to  root  the  education  and 
help  the  child  students  learn  without  worry,  train  their  self-confidence  and 
develop their future. The “Elevated Tree Program Scholarship” implemented 
in 2021 has assisted a total 6,784 disadvantaged child students in paying their 
tuition and miscellaneous expenses, processing fees and after-school program 
fees.In order to extend the spirit of the Elevated Tree Program - Grow A Big Tree 
From  A  Shoot,  the  Bank  also  encouraged  students  to  engage  in  physical 
education activities in 2021. The “Elevated Tree Program - Physical Education 
Donation” was applied to support elementary schools’ and junior high schools’ 
promotion of the physical education spirit, train child students’ self-discipline 
and  teamwork,  and  help  them  discover  themselves  through  participation  in 
large-size sports games.In  2021,  the  Bank  sponsored  10  sports  teams,  including  the  soccer  team  of168Nantou  County  Shuili  Elementary  School,  for  participation  in  sports  games, 
training expenditure and purchase of the relevant gear, and also sponsored the 
organization  of  3  games  of  the  “Xucun  Cup  National  Juvenile  Soccer 
Competition.”② Activities co-organized by Cathay Charity Group:The Bank participated in “Cathay Scholarship,” “Teach For Taiwan (TFT),” 
“Cathay Dream Come True Project for Child Students,” “After-School Care 
Program in Rural Areas” and “Giving Winter Warmth,” and was involved in 
the preparation of Cathay Charity Group annual report.2. Art and cultural events:Based on the core philosophy of support for the local arts and promotion of art 
education, Cathay United Art Center organizes the art exhibitions and seminars 
periodically to provide Taiwan’s artists with the stage for their performance and 
also enable the public to have the chance to appreciate, and learn from, the arts 
without  charge.  Due  to  the  raging  epidemic,  only  5  art  exhibitions  and  5  art 
lectures were organized in 2021. Meanwhile, in response to Cathay Arts Festival, 
the new century potential painting was exhibited. Further, it also designed Cathay 
Financial Group’s art calendar based on the theme “Finding the Light, Finding 
the Future”, in order to promote the beauty of the good deed.3. Charity and sponsored activities:In  order  to  extend  the  care  for  indigenous  people  and  social  &  business 
development,  in  2021,  the  Bank  procured  the  homemade  products  from  the 
“Down  Syndrome  Foundation  of  the  R.O.C.,”  “Yu-cheng  Social  Welfare 
Foundation” and “Pingtung Christian Bethany Home (PCBH),” out of the intent 
to create the demand and supply through the  procurement project and also the 
revenue for the social welfare organizations; provided financial aid to the “Bunun 
Cultural  and  Education  Foundation”  to  help  it  maintain  park  operations  and 
promote  the  tourism  to  train  the  Bunun  people’s  self-sufficiency  ability; 
sponsored PCBH to have the service recipients exercise their own abilities and 
find  their  self-confidence  and  value  through  the  diversified  service  models; 
sponsored the “84th Tai-Yang Arts Exhibition” by Tai-Yang Art Association; and 
sponsored the “45th Oil Painting Competition and Exhibition” by the Republic 
of China Oil Painting Association.4. Environmental protection system:The Bank insists on supporting the sustainable environmental development and 
engages  in  the  “transformation  to  zero-carbon  business,”  to  reduce  the  carbon 
emission in the financial service process. In 2021, the Bank took the initiative to 
adopt the Product Category Rules (PCR) for “personal unsecured loan service” 
among the peers in the same industry, and became the first bank receiving the 
Carbon Footprint Label and Carbon Footprint Reduction Label for the product. 
The Bank’s loan policy completely supports the green energy development and 
also takes into account the ESG factors in the green finance investment and loan.169investigation,Meanwhile, the Bank promote the green workplace in its operations, including 
GHG 
implementation  of  ISO  energy  and  environmental 
management  system,  construction  of  the  branches’  smart  energy  management 
system  and  replacement  of  old  and  energy-consuming  equipment.  The  Head 
Office is expected to attain the target of 100% green power consumption by 2025, 
while  domestic  business  locations  are  expected  to  attain  the  target  of  100% 
renewable energy consumption by 2030 to practice the RE100 target by 2030.IV.  No. of full-time non-managerial employees, mean and median salary

terminal  and  network  equipment  are  being  guarded  by  a  tiered  information 
security  protection  system  that  incorporates  measures  such  as:  advanced 
network  firewall,  network  system  firewall, 
intrusion  detection,  web 
application  firewall, APT  protection  etc.  DDoS  defense  and  ISP  clean  pipe 
service have also been adopted to protect against malicious attacks. Combined 
with  the  use  of  intelligent  and  automated  information  security  monitoring 
system,  the  Bank  is  able  to  effectively  protect  and  monitor  its  systems  and 
networks  against  threats.  Furthermore,  the  Bank  constantly  reviews  the 
security  framework  of  its  computer  system,  and  assesses  weaknesses  on  all 
aspects  from  information  security,  network  administration,  anti-virus,  anti-
hack to the recovery plan. We hope to enhance information security measures 
in  a  way  that  caters  for  security  and  convenience  at  the  same  time,  while 
reducing the  risk  of  data  leakage and  threat  of  malicious  intrusion  from  the 
outside. By enhancing security over the Bank’s computer system and network, 
we are able to assure the quality of service delivered to customers.VI.  Cybersecurity management(I)  Describe  the  cybersecurity  risk  management  framework,  cybersecurity  policies, 
concrete  management  programs,  and  investments  in  resources  for  cybersecurity 
management:1.  The Bank established the information security dedicated unit in March 2018 
to take charge of the planning, supervision and promotion of the information 
security  policies  and  management,  and  also  designated  the  management 
holding the position as Vice President or above or equivalent to serve as the 
CIO in charge of the promotion of information security policies and resource 
allocation concurrently.2.  The Bank reviews the information security policies periodically, and follows 
the  information  security  roadmap  of  the  parent  company,  Cathay  Financial 
Holdings,  as  guiding  principles.  Meanwhile, 
implements 
cybersecurity protections as part of internal control in line with industry trends, 
new technologies, cloud applications, laws and self-governing rules. The unit 
is  also  responsible  for  maintaining  certification  with  global  cybersecuritythe  Bank172standards  (such  as  ISO  27001  and  PCIDSS).  Furthermore,  the  Bank 
implements the FFIEC CAT to evaluate the maturity of information security, 
and conducts review and improvement per the revaluation results periodically. 
The Bank also engages external professional consultants and white hat hackers 
to  perform  security  assessments  and  tests  on  a  yearly  basis,  so  that 
improvements can be  made as necessary  to enhance and keep cybersecurity 
protections up to date.3.  In order to ensure the compliance with and promotion of information security 
policies, and supervise and coordinate the information security management 
tasks,  the  Bank  establishes  the  cross-functional  “Information  Security 
Committee.”  The  Bank’s  President  serves  as  the  Committee  Chairman,  and 
invites  the  heads  of  information,  legal  affairs,  legal  compliance,  risk 
management,  information  security  and  digital  transformation  to  form  the 
Committee.  The  CIO  holds  the  position  as  the  executive  secretary.  The 
Committee shall meet at least once per six months.4.  The  Bank  has  devised  a  4-year  program  in  support  of  FSC’s  “Financial 
Information Security Action Plan” introduced on August 6, 2020. The action 
plan  aims  to  strengthen  the  financial  industry’s  protection  against  security 
threat, thereby ensuring the security, convenience, and continuity of services 
rendered. The  objectives to be completed by  financial institution are almost 
completed,  including  appointment  of  the  CIO,  selection  of  the  information 
security  consulting 
international  cybersecurity 
standards and acquisition of relevant certification, effectiveness assessment on 
cybersecurity governance, establishment of cybersecurity monitoring service 
center, encouragement to cybersecurity personnel for obtaining international 
certification,  assembly  of  emergency  response  team  for  cybersecurity

provided:When carrying out the Electronic Funds Transfer (“EFT”) and database upgrading 
operations,  the  system  abnormality  resulted  in  the  failure  of  certain  transactions 
via  ATM.  In  order  to  compensate  customers,  the  Bank  refunded/reduced  the 
customers’ service  charges totaling NT$7,149,000. The Bank will  perform  more 
complete stimulation and alter the review procedure to achieve the test on stability 
and accuracy and ensure the system’s stable operation.173VII. Industrial Relations(I)  Employee  welfare,retirement  system  and 
negotiation and protection of employees' interest:implementation,  employment1.  Employee benefit measures:Apart from mandatory coverage such as Labor Insurance and National Health 
Insurance, the Bank also arranges term life insurance and accident insurance 
and  offers  dependent  medical  insurance  and  wedding/funeral/childbirth 
subsidies  to  give  employees  the  ultimate  peace  of  mind  throughout  their 
employment. In terms of skill improvement, the Bank subsidizes employees 
in various activities from professional certification, English proficiency exam 
to  training  courses.  For  the  creation  of  friendly  and  healthy  workplace,  the 
Bank  has  arranged  a  series  of  programs  including  maternity  protection, 
healthcare, mental counseling, massage service, club activities, travel subsidy, 
jogging and weight loss to achieve its goal.2.  Pension system:The Bank has implemented its retirement system in accordance with the Labor 
Standards Act and Labor Pension Act. The Bank engages an actuary to make 
relevant calculations for its pension fund, and makes monthly contributions to 
the labor pension fund account. The pension fund is reported on a regular basis. 
Following  the  implementation  of  Labor  Pension  Act  (i.e.  New  Pension 
Scheme)  on  July  1,  2005,  the  Bank  has  been  making  monthly  contributions 
equal to 6% of monthly salary for employees whom the New Pension Scheme 
is  applicable. These  contributions  are  credited  into  the  employees’  personal 
accounts held with the Bureau of Labor Insurance.3.  Employment negotiation and protection of employees’ interests:The Bank convenes regular labor-management meetings as required by Labor 
Standards Act. These meetings provide the opportunity to communicate with 
employees on welfare measures or management systems, or discuss material 
issues  concerning  employment  and  labor  regulations.  They  are  intended  to 
promote interaction and communication between the employer and employees 
so that actions can be taken to maximize mutual interest between staff and the 
Bank. In addition, the Bank uses communication channels such as new recruits 
seminar,  regional  meeting  and  the  feedback  system  to  gather  employees’ 
suggestions,  convey  core  value,  and  thereby  achieve  the  above.  These 
communication channels not only provide employees with broader means to 
express opinions, but also enable the Bank to respond more promptly to the 
needs  of  individual  staff  and  help  them  adapt  to  changes  within  the 
organization.In terms of employee protection measures, the Bank has developed work rules 
in  accordance  with  the  Labor  Standards  Act  and  implemented  with  the

1.  [NPL ratio] decreased: The Bank’s aggressive disposal of NPL and solicitation for the opportunity to collect NPL resulted in the decrease in NPL by NT$696 million from 2020, thus improving the overallasset quality significantly.2.  [Interest expense as a % of yearly average deposit balance] decreased: Mainly due to the increase in demand deposits by NT$124 billion at the end of 2021. 
3.  [Profit growth rate] grew: Mainly due to the decrease in “interest expenses” by NT$4 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. 
4.  [Cash flow ratio], [cash flow adequacy ratio] and [cash flow coverage ratio] increased: Mainly due to the increase in “net cash flow from operating activities” by NT$62.3 billion in 2021.

Operational ability(1)  Deposit to loan ratio = total loan / total deposit 
(2)  NPL ratio = total non-performing loan / total loan 
(3)  Interest expense as a % of yearly average deposit balance = total interest expense on deposits / yearly average deposit balance 
(4)  Interest revenue as a % of yearly average loan balance = total interest revenue from loans / yearly average loan balance 
(5)  Total assets turnover = net profit/average total assets 
(6)  Revenues per employee (Note 7) = net revenue / total employees 
(7)  Average earnings per employee = corporate earnings / total number of employees2.  Profitability(1)  Return on tier 1 capital = profit before tax / average tier 1 capital. 
(2)  Return on assets = after-tax profit / average total assets. 
(3)  Return on equity = after-tax profit / average total shareholders’ equity. 
(4)  Net profit margin = corporate earnings/net income 
(5)  Earnings per share (EPS) = (attributable to shareholders’ equity of the parent – preferred stock dividends) / weighed average quantity of outstanding shares.(Note 5)3.  Financial structure(1)  Debt to asset ratio = total liabilities / total assets. 
(2)  Property, plant and equipment to equity ratio = net property, plant and equipment / net shareholders’ equity.1854.  Growth rate (%)(1)  Asset growth rate = (total assets in current year – total assets in previous year) / total assets in previous year. 
(2)  Profitability growth rate = (earnings before taxation in current year – earnings before taxation in previous year) / earnings before taxation in previous year.5.  Cash flows (Note 8)(1)  Cash flow ratio = net cash flow from operating activities / (interbank borrowing and overdraft + commercial papers payable + financial liability at fair value through income statement + RP billand bond liabilities + accruals payable within one year).(2)  Net cash flow adequacy ratio = net cash flows from operating activities in the last five years / (capital expenditure + cash dividend) in the last five years. 
(3)  Cash flow coverage ratio = net cash flow from operation / net cash flow from investment.6.  Liquidity reserve ratio = liquid assets mandated by The Central Bank / mandatory liquidity reserves. 
7.  Scale of operation(1)  Market share of assets = total assets / total assets of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activities(Note 6) 
(2)  Market share of net worth = net worth / total net worth of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activities 
(3)  Market share of deposits = total deposit / total deposit of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activities 
(4)  Market share of loans = total loan / total loan of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activitiesNote 3:  Total liabilities are net of provisions for guarantees and accidental losses.Note 4:  Attention to the following is required when the aforementioned equations for the calculation of EPS are applied to assessment:1.  The weighted average quantity of outstanding common shares shall be used as the standard, not the quantity of outstanding shares at the end of the year. 
2.  In case of raising capital through issuing new shares or transactions of treasury stocks, calculate also the weighted average quantity of outstanding shares in the period of circulation. 
3.  In case of capitalization of retained earnings or capitalization of capital surplus into new shares, adjustment shall be made in retrospect to the size of capitalization for each instance when calculatingthe earnings per shares annually or semi-annually. The time of issuance can be neglected.4.  If the preferred shares are non-convertible accumulated preferred shares, the dividend declared in current period (whether paid or unpaid) shall be deducted from corporate earnings or as addition toearnings after taxation.5.  If the accumulated preferred shares are not accumulative in nature, dividend for preferred shares shall be deducted from corporate earnings, if any. In case of loss, no adjustment shall be made.Note 5:  Financial  institutions  eligible  to  perform  deposit  and  loan-related  activities  include  local  banks,  Taiwanese  branches  of  Mainland  banks,  Taiwanese  branches  of  foreign  banks,  credit  cooperativeassociations, and credit departments of farmers / fishermen associations.Note 6:  Revenue refers to the sum of interest and non-interest revenues.Note 7:  The cash flow analysis takes into account the following:1.  Net cash flow from operating activities is taken from the amount of net cash flow from operating activities presented in the cash flow statement. 
2.  Capital expenditure refers to the amount of annual cash outflow for capital investments. 
3.  Cash dividends include cash dividends to both common shares and preferred shares. 
4.  Gross property, plant, and equipment refers to the amount before deducting accumulated depreciation.186Analysis ItemCapitalCapital adequacy ratioUnit: NT$ thousandYear20212020201920182017ConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneCapital adequacy ratio for the most recent yearCommon share equityTier 1 non-common share equityTier 2 capitalCapitalStandardized approachInternal ratings based approachCredit

Capital, risk-weighted assets and total risk exposure shown in this table have been calculated according to “Regulations Governing the Capital Adequacy and Capital Category of Banks” and “CalculationExplanation and Form for Bank Regulatory Capital and Risk-Weighted Assets.”3.  Below are the formulas used for the calculations in this table:(1)  Capital = common share equity + Tier 1 non-common share equity + Tier 2 capital. 
(2)  Total risk weighted assets = credit risk weighted assets + required capital for (operational risk + market risk) × 12.5. 
(3)  Capital adequacy ratio = capital / total risk weighted assets. 
(4)  Tier 1 capital as a % of risk-weighted assets = (common share equity + other tier 1 capital that is not common share equity) / total risk-weighted assets. 
(5)  Common share equity as a % of risk-weighted assets = common share equity / total risk-weighted assets. 
(6)  Leverage ratio = net tier 1 capital / total risk exposure.4.

response measures to optimize asset quality while 
ensuring the integrity of its capital structure.(4) Procedures: The Bank complies with business-related regulations and implementation rules, and

service, collateral or credit guarantee. With the help of 
systems such as interim credit review and collateral 
management, the Bank is able to monitor all types of 
mitigation tools used in business.5.

and organizationThe Bank has effective operational risk management 
framework and systems in place to manage banking 
operations, improve efficiency, reduce risk exposure, and 
secure assets.Apart from converting operational risk strategies into feasible 
policies and procedures, the Bank also conducts operational 
risk self-assessment, reports operational risk incidents, and 
uses key risk indicators to help identify, assess, and monitor 
risks:(1) Operational risk self-assessment: To identify risks 
associated with operational activities as well as the 
underlying cause, control methods and risk exposure, and 
thereby enable response plans.(2) Operational risk incident reporting: The reporting process 
is triggered whenever an operational risk incident occurs, 
so that the underlying cause can be identified, assessed, 
and discussed for improvement.(3) Key risk indicators: Develop indicators for the potentialrisks identified to facilitate evaluation of changes in 
exposure.The board of directors is the Bank’s ultimate decision-
making authority in regards to operational risk management. 
The risk management framework has specialized units 
established to help plan and implement operational risk 
management system, assist departments in the establishment 
of standard operating procedures, and 
consolidate/analyze/monitor operational risks for the entire 
bank with reports made to the board of directors and senior 
management. The Internal Audit Department is responsible 
for auditing the appropriateness and implementation of 
operational risk management systems by all departments 
within the Bank.204ItemDetails3. Scope and features ofoperational risk reports

for monitoring the 
effectiveness of risk

toolsThe Bank has implemented an operational risk incident 
database, and regularly enforces its operational risk self-
assessment and key risk indicators. Operational risk self-
assessments and key risk indicators are used to classify risk 
exposures into high, medium and low level. Response 
measures have been devised for the different levels of risk 
identified to enable effective monitoring and improve 
operational risk exposure. The operational risk event database 
is tracked, analyzed and reported regularly; procedure and 
system optimizations are proposed based on the analysis 
report.The Bank conducts risk self-assessment prior to launching 
new financial products (including new business categories, 
products and service models). Depending on the extent and 
frequency of exposure impact, the Bank uses insurance and 
engages external parties to mitigate or transfer potential 
exposures. The Bank has business continuity policies and 
rules in place to address risk events that are likely to cause 
disruption to business operations. Drills are conducted from 
time to time to minimize possible losses and improve 
employees’ response. Through regular monitoring, 
management reports and review on the use of tools, the Bank 
is able to ensure the effectiveness of its risk avoidance and 
mitigation tools.5.

measures including: limit control, regular reporting, 
internal audit system, independent monitoring 
department and executive committees to effectively 
measure and control market risks associated with 
business activities, and to maximize risk-adjusted profit 
and shareholders' value under tolerable risks. The Bank 
has an internal market risk management unit that 
develops relevant guidelines and standards, executes 
market risk management, and prepares management 
information and reports regularly to accountable 
managers for effective management of market risk.The board of directors is the Bank’s ultimate decision-
making authority in regards to risk strategy and major 
risk policies. The Bank has a specialized market risk 
management unit that operates independently from the 
trading department, as well as an Asset and Liability 
Management Committee and a Risk Management 
Committee that are responsible for supervising market 
risks. The Market Risk Management Department or 
market risk limit controller within overseas branches 
are responsible for the identification, evaluation and 
control of market risk within the Bank, as well as 
executing routine management practices and ensuring 
the correctness and rationality of valuation principles, 
tools, methods and market information used in the 
assessment.The market risk reporting and assessment system 
performs a number of functions including position 
valuation, limit control, gain/loss monitoring, position 
management and calculation, stress testing and 
scenario analysis, pricing model, 
qualitative/quantitative risk reporting and VaR analysis. 
Furthermore, the Bank continually develops a Basel-207ItemDetailscompliant quantitative market risk management model 
to ensure compliance with New Basel Capital Accords, 
and thereby connect financial supervisory practices 
with the rest of the world.4. Market risk avoidance ormitigation policies, and 
strategies and procedures for

reasonable  time  and  price  to  finance  additional  assets  or  repay  liabilities 
when due, and therefore giving rise to possibility of losses.208Liquidity risk management system2021ItemDetails1. Liquidity risk managementstrategies and procedures2. Liquidity risk managementorganization and framework3. Scope and features of theliquidity risk reporting and 
assessment system(1) The Bank manages liquidity risk by placing stability at thetop priority. For this reason, capital estimates are made 
conservatively and the Bank focuses on developing 
diversity and stability in its funding sources. Furthermore, 
uses of capital are balanced between safety and 
profitability, with steps taken to diversity liquidity risks.(2) Business units are required to notify the Finance andAccounting Department and Market Risk Management 
Department of any material changes in liquidity position, 
whether actual or anticipated; Asset & Liability 
Management Committee meetings can be convened on an 
ad-hoc basis to discuss responses first and seek board of 
directors’ approval afterwards.(3) The Bank has liquidity risk tolerance limits and alertindicators in place to manage liquidity risks. The Bank 
adopts a quantitative management approach and prepares 
monthly liquidity management reports for view by Asset & 
Liability Management Committee.(1) The Asset & Liability Management Committee isresponsible for the strategic planning and supervision of 
liquidity risk management within the Bank. Routine 
funding and trading are executed by the Treasury 
Department. Factors that have an adverse effect on 
liquidity are to be analyzed and addressed with 
involvement from the Finance and Accounting Department 
and the Treasury Department in order to mitigate liquidity 
risk impacts upon occurrence of an unexpected event.(2) The Bank has a set of “Liquidity Risk ManagementGuidelines” available to manage liquidity position and 
liquidity risks, and support business risk management by 
maintaining solvency.(1) Scope of liquidity risk assessment may include: highlyliquid assets, funding diversity and stability, balance sheet 
indicators, other liquidity factors and liquidity stress tests.(2) The Bank manages liquidity risk by preparing “Liquidity 
Reserve Requirement Report,” “NTD Maturity Analysis209ItemDetailsReport,” “Liquidity Gap Analysis Report,” “Foreign 
Currency Liquidity Coverage Ratio Report,” and “Net 
Stable Funding Ratio Report” on a regular basis. These 
reports are used to monitor liquidity indicators and ensure 
that figures are within limit.(3) In addition to monitoring liquidity risk through monthly 
reports, the Bank also conducts quarterly liquidity stress 
tests as means to assess its debt servicing capabilities. 
Outcomes are reported to the board of directors every six 
months.(1) Deposit concentration is examined on a regular basis. TheBank prepares “NTD Maturity Analysis Report” on a 
monthly basis, and a “Foreign Currency Liquidity Gap 
Analysis” is prepared for any foreign currency that 
accounts for more than 5% of total liability. This report 
monitors negative gap in foreign currency assets and 
liabilities for each interval, and provides decision makers 
with an indication of how to diversify capital source and 
maturity.(2) Overseas branches are required to discuss capital planswith the Head Office based on asset/liability allocation and 
outcomes of liquidity and interest rate sensitivity analysis. 
Sourcing and use of capital shall comply with rules of the 
local authority and take into account factors such as safety 
and revenue potentials. Any mismatch in the maturity of 
assets and liabilities also have to be properly managed.(1) The Bank has implemented “Business Crisis ResponseMeasures and Management Guidelines” to prevent 
solvency and liquidity crises that may arise in relation to 
occurrences such as abnormal deposit withdrawal, 
substantial loss of capital or liquidity shortage. The 
Guidelines not only ensure timely and effective crisis 
handling, but also mitigate impact from major or sudden 
occurrences to the protection of deposit holders, investors, 
traders and market discipline.(2) The Asset and Liability Management Committee convenedmeetings to devise responses whenever liquidity reserve 
falls below a certain level.4. Capital strategies, includingpolicies on source and maturity

Interest rate risk in the banking book.The  adverse  changes  in  interest  rate  affect  the  value  and  cash  flow  of  the 
banking book position, thus resulting in the current or potential risk over the Bank's 
capital and earnings.Interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) management system2021ItemDetails1. IRRBB management strategiesand procedures2. IRRBB managementframework and organization(1) The Bank manages IRRBB by stable management andconservative policy. The diversity and stability of assets 
and liabilities are identified as the first priority, and then 
safety and profitability, as well as risks diversification.(2) The Bank has IRRBB tolerance limits and alert indicators 
in place to manage the IRRBB. In the case of high risk or 
abnormality, it is necessary to evaluate the approach of 
mitigation, and report to the Asset and Liability 
Management Committee to review the Bank's balance & 
liability structure and pricing principles and mitigate or 
control the adverse effect caused to the Bank's earnings or 
net worth.(1) The Board of Directors serves as the highest decision-making body in the Bank's IRRBB management. Asset and 
Liability Management Committee is responsible for 
supervision, coordination and decision making in the 
Bank’s entire IRRBB management. The routine report and212ItemDetailsrisk limit control shall be executed by Finance and 
Accounting Department.(2) The Bank has adopted the “IRRBB ManagementGuidelines” to monitor the risk over impact to earnings and 
net worth posed by changes in the interest rate and to 
practice the IRRBB management.(1) The approaches to measure IRRBB include repricing gapanalysis, earnings perspective (ΔNII) analysis, and 
economic value prospective analysis (ΔEVE).(2) The Bank prepares the IRRBB management report on amonthly basis, which shall be submitted to the Asset and 
Liability Management Committee to monitor the changes 
in the IRRBB, and also reported to the Board of Directors 
once per six months.(3) The calculation of ΔNII and ΔEVE risk indicators adoptsthe “IRRBB Standards” promulgated by the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and interest 
rate volatility scenario suggested by the Bankers 
Association. Under the six interest rate volatility scenarios 
in December 2021, the maximum loss ΔEVE was less than 
the limit (the maximum loss shall no more than 15% of 
Tier 1 Capital) and, therefore, was held satisfying the 
regulatory requirements.When IRRBB is dealing with, or expected to suffer, any 
material changes, the risk control unit and other related units 
shall evaluate the impact to be posed therefor and whether risk 
mitigation is needed. The relevant strategies shall be reported 
to the Asset and Liability Management Committee for 
approval, and then executed by the business unit to mitigate or 
control the Bank’s IRRBB. The primary steps taken to control 
or mitigate the risk:(1) By adjusting the disproportionate positions in the balancesheet.(2) By holding reverse financial derivatives for mitigation, e.g.Interest rate swap.2133. Scope, characteristics andfrequency of booking book

tools(II)  Impact on the Bank’s financial standing and business operations due to changes in 
domestic or foreign policies and laws, and corresponding countermeasures to such 
changes:Through compliance and internal control systems, the Bank continues to improve 
and optimize response to legal changes. Various measures have been put in place 
to ensure compliance with laws when performing financial service.The following is a summary of key compliance-related actions undertaken during 
the year:1. Bank-wide compliance risk management assessmentThe Bank has adopted a compliance risk management and supervision framework, 
and  conducts  compliance  risk  assessments  regularly  for  all  business  activities 
throughout the Bank with enhancement actions taken accordingly.2. Provide the financial products and services in a resilient manner, in response tothe epidemic.During the epidemic prevention alert raised until Level 3 or above by the Central 
Epidemic Command Center (“CECC”) in any city/county throughout Taiwan, the 
Bank  would  adopt  other  alternative  policies  and  establish  related  alternative 
measures  to  provide  customers  with  financial  products  and  services  that  were 
supposed to provided to customers in person, over the counter and in real time, 
in response to FSC’s policy, insofar as they satisfy the internal control principles 
and are approved through the internal authorization procedure.3. AML and CTF risk management(1)  The  Bank  has  developed  AML/CTF  plans  along  with  standard  operating 
procedures based on applicable laws, risk assessment outcomes and business 
size. Both plans are being implemented accordingly. Meanwhile, the Bank 
included the institutional risk assessment into the AML/CTF internal control 
policy to verify the Bank’s current exposure to AML/CFT risk, manage and 
reduce  identified  risks,  and  strengthen  prevention  and  improve  control 
strength.(2)  In consideration of the emerging fraud cases caused by COVID-19 epidemic, 
the Bank took specific actions to fulfill its corporate social responsibility in 
order to prevent financial crimes and block dummy accounts. These actions 
include  participating  in  public  sectors’  anti-fraud  campaigns,  raising  the 
public awareness toward anti-fraud, asking the first line staff to practice KYC 
and customer due diligence to prevent the public from fraud. Meanwhile, the 
Bank  also  conducted  analysis  and  investigation  on  suspected  dummy 
accounts, and then controlled these accounts to stop abnormal cash flows, in 
order  to  practice  the  corporate  sustainability  spirit  in  the  routine  jobs, 
leverage  the  enterprise’s  influence  and  impression,  and  create  a  financial 
trading environment that make the public relieved and feel safer.2144. Enforcement of supervisory measures for domestic systemically important banks(D-SIBs)(1)  The  Bank  has  also  amended  its  “Business  Crisis  Response  Measures  and 
Management Guidelines” to include response measures when capital adequacy 
ratio falls short of requirement. The amended guidelines have been reported to 
the  authority  along  with  Pillar  II  in  2021  to  complement  the  Bank’s 
management efforts on capital adequacy.(2) The Bank calculates capital adequacy ratio and leverage ratio under stressed 
scenarios  based  on  details  of  the  “Stress  Test  Plan  for  Local  Banks,”  the 
updated probabilities of default published by Joint Credit Information Center 
(JCIC),  and  the  stress  testing  scenarios  outlined  in  FSC’s  correspondence. 
Stress tests are conducted over a 2-year interval, and as a D-SIBs, the Bank 
would be required to propose response measures when submitting stress test 
results  if  it  fails  to  meet  the  minimum  capital  requirements  and  annual 
additional capital requirements under stressed scenarios.(III)  Impact  on  the  Bank’s  financial  standing  due  to  technological  (includingcybersecurity risk) or industrial changes, and corresponding countermeasures:The  Company  complies  with  the  competent  authority's  information  security 
regulations  and  acts  in  response  to  the  “Financial  Information  Security Action 
Plan.”  Besides,  the  Company  has  already  implemented  the  ISMS,  received 
certification  (ISO27001  and  PCIDSS),  and  kept  improving  and  maintaining  the 
validity thereof. In order to deal with emerging risks and attacks, the Bank retains 
external information security advisors to perform the computer system information 
security  evaluation,  penetration  test,  red  team  assessment,  and  customer  service 
program  testing  service,  in  order  to  verify  the  validity  of  the  Bank's  security 
protection mechanism, periodically or at any time whenever it is necessary, each 
year. Further, in order to improve the protection of risk over information security 
threats,  the  Bank  has  purchased  the  information  security  insurance  to  help 
strengthen  customers’  confidence  toward  the  Bank's  corporate  sustainability 
continuously.1. In response to the Bank’s comprehensive digitalization, the Bank will, based on 
the  wholesale  banking  data  model,  establish  the  one-stop  service  platform  and 
complete  the  marketing  management,  development  of  name  list  and  account 
planning  through  one  single  system,  in  order  to  reduce  the  disruptions  in 
procedures and improve service efficiency. Meanwhile, the Bank will, based on 
the  internal/external  information  analysis,  engage  in  customer  segment 
management to deepen the bond between the business end and customers. The 
Bank  will  continue  to  empower  its  sales  representatives  with  its  data  analysis 
technology to provide customers with better sale experience.2. In order to deal with competition for wealth  management services  in the same 
industry and across industries, the Bank will continue to perfect the end-to-end215digital  transaction  process  while  at  the  same  time  upgrade  its  online  banking 
webpage  and  App  with  investment-related  features  that  promote  good  user 
experience as well. Meanwhile, the Bank will utilize the abundant customer bases 
and  data  model  analysis  technology  to  gain  accurate  insight  to  customers’ 
preference  and  investment  needs,  provide  the  suggestions  on  products  and 
investment  strategies  for  individual  customers,  monitor  risks  of  customers’ 
positions, adhere to the stable management philosophy, and strengthen the control 
over customers’ investment risk to provide customers with undisrupted online to 
offline (O2O) investment customization service.3. The  Bank  will  also  utilize  the  Group's  resources  to  provide  financial  services 
across subsidiaries, e.g. investment in overseas stocks and bonds via the online 
banking APP  and  fast  opening  of  Cathay  securities  account,  in  order  to  help 
customer seize the investment opportunities.4. Digital  technologies,  insurance  digital  application,  and  electronic  security  are 
being introduced to physical channels to fully digitalize the sales process. With 
the support of automated system checks, customers are given access to a diverse 
range  of  financial  services  as  well  as  faster  and  more  simplified  insurance 
application processes.5. In the post-epidemic era, the Bank adopts the “customer experience” and “Mobile 
First”-based  core  policy  to  continue  playing  a  positive  role  in  the  financial 
innovation policy and Fintech development. It will continue to launch diversified 
innovative digital services and products, and also work with the partners inside 
and outside the Group to develop various scene services at the same time to build 
the best O2O experience and make the digital channel irreplaceable in customers’ 
life.6. Growth of digital banking and electronic payment reduces people’s dependency 
on  cash.  Together,  they  create  a  cashless  environment  and  give  rise  to  new 
payment channels that not only change customers’ shopping needs and behaviors, 
but also enable gathering of transaction information for the creation of a banking 
environment  that  conforms  with  people’s  needs.  This  integration  between 
payment  service  and  mobile  device  allows  merchants  to  develop  new  ways  to 
interact with customers and presents banks with new profit models.(IV)  Impact from a change of image and response measures:1. Change of social responsibilities, image and other major events:(1)   Support for Cathay United Bank Foundation’s “Elevated Tree Program”① The “Elevated Tree Program” has long been caring for underprivileged 
children.  The  program  escalated  its  promotion  efforts  last  year,  using 
animation  videos,  social  media,  and  news  coverage  to  raise  fund  from 
the public to make the goal “Care Underprivileged Children With Love 
and Grow A Big Tree From A Shoot” happen.216② In order to support the physical education development in the rural areas, 
the Bank has been sponsoring “Cathay United Xucun Cup International 
Soccer Competition” for 5 consecutive years since 2017 with the hope of 
helping local teams secure a place in world’s top 100.③ Combined with the professional financial competency, the Bank called 
on  its  volunteer  workers  to  provide  the  children  in  rural  areas  with  a 
series of basic financial education courses online, in order to teach them 
the correct view of money.(2)  The Banks donated funds to help various sectors  go  through the difficulttime, in order to fulfill its corporate social responsibility.① When  COVID-19  epidemic  was  raging  severely  in  Taiwan,  the  Bank 
responded to the Group's call and donated NT$62 million to city/county 
governments and hospitals to show its support for the first line epidemic 
prevention workers and do its part for epidemic prevention in Taiwan.② The  Kaohsiung  structure  fire  accident  caused  the  severe  casualty. 
Because  the  victims’  family  and  post-disaster  reconstruction  project 
needed  supports,  the  Bank  donated  NT$7.5  million  to  “Social  Affairs 
Bureau of Kaohsiung City Government” to comfort people physically.2.

Bank merger: None.2. Expected benefits of merger and acquisition:(1) Creates synergy, increases market share and expands business presence andsize.(2) Enables centralized capital/resource allocation, back-end integration, shared 
use of premise and equipment, and employee productivity improvement that 
ultimately  reduces  operating  cost  and  increases  return  on  shareholders' 
equity.(3) Enables  replication  of  exceptional  management  practices  through  a  time-tested platform that improves overall performance.(4) Increases  asset  size  and  shareholders'  equity;  enables  cross-industry 
integration and joint marketing that provides customers with one-stop access 
to diverse financial services.3. Possible risks of merger and acquisition, and response measures:(1) Merger and acquisition may fail due to poor strategy, weak target, dishonestconduct, change of circumstances, or overprice.(2) Lack  of  proper  integration  in  terms  of  organization,  information  system, 
corporate culture and human resource management will affect the result of 
merger and acquisition.(3) The Company will undertake rigorous reviews and carefully select its targets 
to  avoid  possible  risks  associated  with  mergers  and  acquisitions.  Detailed 
assessments such as environmental change, capacity limit, competitiveness, 
competitors,  industry,  domestic/foreign  economy,  sensitivity  analysis  and 
M&A  regulations  will  be  performed  during  the  planning  stage.  For  any 
merger  completed,  the  Company  will  commit  efforts  into  enforcing  its 
consolidation plan to maximize synergy.220(VI)  Expected benefits of business office expansion, the potential risks involved, andresponse measures:No  new  service  location  was  established  in  2021,  and  the  Bank  maintained  a 
network  of  165  branches  but  relocated  2  branches  (Chungshan  and  Neike)  to 
optimize distribution, satisfy customers’ needs, and maximize overall profitability 
of the Bank.(VII) Risk and response action from concentrated operations:1. Internal operational controlForm of risk incidentNatureControlsInternal fraudEmployment customs

and  evaluates  them  on  a  regular  basis  to  avoid  excessive  concentration  when 
carrying  out  banking  services.  For  every  application  submitted,  both  the 
business  unit  and  the  approver  are  required  to  examine  utilization  of  the 
concentration limit and exercise concentration management of different aspects 
if  appropriate.  In  terms  of  concentration  monitoring,  the  Bank  has  adopted 
systematic  practices  to  alert  limit  breach  on  a  daily  basis.  Limit  monitoring 
reports are presented to the Risk Management Committee on a regular basis to 
facilitate management of concentration risks. For overly concentrated assets, the221Bank may choose to suspend certain business activities or reduce concentration 
through sale or securitization of excess assets.(VIII) Effect and risk caused by the changes of the right to manage to the Bank, and thecountermeasures thereof:There had been no change of management in 2021.(IX)  Impacts, risks and response measures following a major transfer of shareholdingby directors, supervisors, or shareholders with more than 1% ownership interest:There had been no major transfer of ownership between shareholders in 2021.(X)  Major litigations, non-contentious cases, or administrative litigations involving the 
Bank or any director, supervisor, President, or major shareholder with more than 
1% ownership interest, whether concluded or pending judgment, that are likely to 
pose significant impact to deposit holders or shareholders or security prices of the 
Bank. Disclose the nature of dispute, the amount involved, the date the litigation 
first started, the key parties involved, and progress as of the publication date of this 
annual reportAs of December 31, 2021, the Bank had the following unresolved major litigation 
that arose in relation to normal business activities:thatinthe  BankLee  &  Li,  Attorneys-at-Law  (hereinafter,  “Lee  &  Li”)alleged 
the 
embezzlement  case  of Wei-Chieh  Liu  (a  former  employee  of  Lee  &  Li),  which 
occurred in October 2003, was caused by the negligence of the Bank, and Lee & 
Li  claimed  damages  from 
the  amount  of  approximately 
NT$991,002,000. The case was brought to the court since July 2007, and Cathay 
United Bank won favorable decisions in both first instance and second instances. 
At  present,  the  original  second-instance  judgment  was  reversed  by  the  Supreme 
Court and remanded to the Taiwan High Court for further review. The Taiwan High 
Court still rendered another ruling in favor of the Bank on August 25, 2021. For 
this, Lee & Li, Attorneys-at-Law has filed an appeal. Now, the appeal is pending 
trial by the Supreme Court. The Bank and its attorney expect no material adverse 
impact on the Bank’s financial position due to the above litigation.(XI)  Other material risks and corresponding measures:In order to deal with the risk over business interruption caused by significant urgent 
incidents,  the  Bank  has  established  the  business  continuity  management 
mechanism  to  maintain  the  business  continuity  and  resilience,  recover  the  key 
business rapidly, mitigate the losses to the minimum and protect customers’ interest 
and rights.222VII. Special Event Management(I)  Major incidents:1. Occurrence  of  robbery,  grand  larceny,  vandalism  of  office  premise  orequipment, threat or natural disaster are handled as follows:(1)  If the incident occurs during business hours, the manager or staff on-
site (including non-bank collectors and cash transporters) shall quickly 
activate the security  alarm and notify the policy  by  dialing “110” or 
“119.” The incident must also be reported to the unit head immediately 
for escalation to senior officers and managers within the Head Office.(2)  If  the  incident  occurs  outside  business  hours,  the  staff  on  shift  shall 
first contact the police by dialing “110” or “119” and then report to the 
unit head and senior officers at Head Office. For branches that adopt 
security  system  in  place  of  shift  arrangement,  emergency  incidents 
shall  be  reported  according  to  the  terms  of  the  “Security  Service 
Agreement” that the Bank has signed with the security service provider.(3)  Proper responses of personnel on site:① When under threat of armed robbers, employees must refrain from 
any attempt of resistance and should remain calm and take note of 
suspects’  appearance,  accent,  age,  hair,  clothing,  height,  personal 
traits,  tools  and  vehicles  including  color  and  license  registration. 
Activate alarm where possible.② Evacuate  personnel  on  site  through  emergency  broadcast  in  the 
event  of  fire  alarm  or  upon  discovery  of  explosive,  and  assign 
employees to prevent entry by unrelated personnel. Do not attempt 
to remove or disarm explosive, and instead notify departments of 
relevant expertise.③ Injured  personnel  must  be  referred  to  the  hospital  for  medicalassistance.④ The scene should be properly maintained for police investigation.⑤ The  unit  head  and  Human  Resource  Department  manager  shouldaccompany Bank staff in police questionings where possible.⑥ Natural disasters are to be reported according to the Bank’s “Noteson Natural Disaster Report.”(4)  Business units that have weaknesses exposed through events such as 
robbery  are  required  to  conduct  self-audit  immediately  according  to 
“Financial  Institution  Crime  Prevention  Assessment.”  Assessment 
outcomes  must  be  reported  onto  the  “Audit  Application  System” 
within two days after self-audit.2232. In the event of fraud or major operational defect caused by lack of internalcontrol:The  employee  suspected  of  fraud  must  be  removed  from  current  duties 
immediately; access to sensitive information  and computer terminal must 
also be restricted/terminated.3. Any inspection by the local authority that closed with adverse conclusions 
such  as  downgrade,  “possibility  of  further  action,”  “possibility  of 
administrative  penalty”  or  “significant  financial  inspection  finding”  must 
be reported according to “Cathay United Bank Notes on Handling of Major 
Incidents.”  The  Internal  Audit  Office  then  has  to  notify  directors, 
supervisors  or  the  authority,  and  raise  the  issue  for  discussion  during  the 
upcoming  board  of  directors  meeting  based  on  the  materiality  principles 
outlined in the Notes.4. Each  unit  is  required  to  develop  an  emergency  contact  system  to  ensure

report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with The Norm of Professional Ethics 
for Certified Public Accountant of the Republic of China, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
 
Key Audit Matters 
 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 
2021. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.247Key audit matters for the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
December 31, 2021 are as follows: 
 
Impairment Assessment of Loans 
 
The domestic loans of the Bank which amounted to $1,674,216,558 thousand were considered 
material to the financial statements as a whole. As the assessment of impairment of loans involves 
accounting estimates and management’s significant judgment, and as the amount of impairment 
assessed on loans under the relevant regulations issued by the authorities is substantially larger than 
that assessed under IFRS 9, hence, we determined the impairment of the loans assessed under the 
relevant regulations prescribed by the authorities as a key audit matter. 
 
The Bank’s management regularly assesses its loans for impairment. Recognition of impairment 
loss on loans is based on compliance with regulations issued by the authorities regarding the 
classification of credit assets and provision of impairment loss. For the accounting policies and 
relevant information on the impairment assessment of loans, refer to Notes 4, 5 and 14. 
 
The main audit procedures we performed in response to the key audit matter described above are as 
follows: 
 
1.  We understood and tested the internal controls of impairment assessment of loans. 
 
2.  We tested the classification of the credit assets into their respective categories out of the totalfive categories to see if it complies with the relevant regulations issued by the authorities.3.  We performed the test on selected samples to ensure the appropriateness of impairment by thelength of the overdue period and the value of the collateral of each respective loan.4.  We calculated the provision of impairment loss by classifying the credit assets into theirrespective category to see if it complies with the relevant regulations issued by the authorities.Other Matter 
 
We have also audited the separate financial statements of the Bank as of and for the year ended 
December 31, 2021 on which we have issued an unmodified opinion. 
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the ConsolidatedFinancial StatementsManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by 
Public Banks, and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International Accounting 
Standards (IAS), IFRIC Interpretations (IFRIC), and SIC Interpretations (SIC) endorsed and issued 
into effect by the Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic of China, and for such 
internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends 
to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
Those charged with governance, including the supervisors, are responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.248Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards 
generally accepted in the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. 
 
As part of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of 
China, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also: 
 
1.Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.2.  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design auditprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.3.  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accountingestimates and related disclosures made by management.4.  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis ofaccounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.5.  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financialstatements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.6.  Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entitiesor business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the group 
audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies 
in internal control that we identify during our audit.249From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended December 31, 2021 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our 
auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication. 
 
The engagement partners on the audits resulting in this independent auditors’ report are Cheng-
Hung Kuo and Shiuh-Ran Cheng.

The  Bank’s  stock  was  originally  trading  on  the  Taiwan  Stock  Exchange  (the  “TWSE”)  until 
December  18,  2002,  where  it  was  delisted  after  becoming  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Cathay

The  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Regulations 
Governing  the  Preparation  of  Financial  Reports  by  Public  Banks,  and  the  International  Financial 
Reporting  Standards  (IFRS),  International  Accounting  Standards  (IAS),  Interpretations  of  IFRS 
(IFRIC), and Interpretations of IAS (SIC) (collectively, the “IFRSs”) endorsed and issued into effect 
by the FSC. 
 
 
Basis of Preparation 
 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  the  historical  cost  basis  except  for 
financial instruments and investment properties which are measured at fair value, and net defined 
benefit liabilities which are measured at the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the 
fair value of plan assets.263The fair value measurements are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair 
value  measurement  inputs  are  observable  and  the  significance  of  the  inputs  to  the  fair  value 
measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:a.  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;b.  Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observablefor the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices);andc.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.Basis of Consolidation 
 
Principles for preparing the consolidated financial statements 
 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Bank and the entities 
controlled by the Bank (Indovina Bank, CUBC Bank and CUBCN Bank). 
 
The accounting policies of the consolidated entities are same.   
 
All  intercompany  transactions,  balances,  income  and  expenses  are  eliminated  in  full  upon 
consolidation. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Bank 
and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit 
balance. 
 
Changes  in  the  Company’s  ownership  interests  in  subsidiaries  that  do  not  result  in  the  Company 
losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of 
the interests of the Company and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in 
their  relative  interests  in  the  subsidiaries.  Any  difference  between  the  amount  by  which  the  non-
controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized 
directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Bank. 
 
The Bank’s financial statements include the accounts of the head office, all branches, and OBU, in 
addition to the subsidiaries’ accounts. All intercompany transactions and accounts balances have been 
eliminated for consolidation purposes. 
Entities included in the consolidated financial statements 
 
See Note 16 for detailed information on subsidiaries (including percentages of ownership and main 
businesses). 
 
Foreign Currencies 
 
In preparing the financial statements of each entity in the group, transactions in currencies other than 
the  Company’s  functional  currency  (foreign  currencies)  are  recognized  at  the  rates  of  exchange 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
 
At  the  end  of  each  reporting  period,  monetary  items  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are 
retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Exchange differences on monetary items arising from264settlement or translation are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for 
exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which 
settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the 
foreign  operation),  which are recognized  initially  in other  comprehensive income  and  reclassified 
from equity to profit or loss on disposal of the net investments.   
 
Non-monetary  items  measured  at  fair  value  that  are  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are 
retranslated  at  the  rates  prevailing  at  the  date  when  the  fair  value  was  determined.  Exchange 
differences arising from the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the 
period  except  for  exchange  differences  arising  from  the  retranslation  of  non-monetary  items  in 
respect of which gains and losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which 
cases, the exchange differences are also recognized in other comprehensive income. 
 
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
 
For the purposes of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the 
Company’s  foreign  operations  (including  subsidiaries,  associates,  joint  ventures  and  branches  in 
other  countries  that  use  currencies  which  are  different  from  the  currency  of  the  Company)  are 
translated into the presentation currency, the New Taiwan dollar, as follows: Assets and liabilities 
are  translated  at  the exchange  rates prevailing  at the end  of the  reporting  period;  and income  and 
expense items are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the time of the transactions or the 
average exchange rates for the period. The resulting currency translation differences are recognized 
in other comprehensive income (attributed to the owners of the Bank and non-controlling interests as 
appropriate). 
 
Current and Non-current Assets and Liabilities 
 
Since the operating cycle in the banking industry cannot be reasonably identified, accounts included 
in the consolidated financial statements of the Company were not classified as current or non-current. 
Nevertheless, accounts were properly categorized in accordance with the nature of each account and 
sequenced by their liquidity. 
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
In the consolidated balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits, 
and short-term, highly liquid investments or time deposits that mature within 12 months from the 
date  of  acquisition  and  readily  convertible  to  a  known  amount  of  cash  and  are  subject  to  an 
insignificant risk of changes in value. In the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents comprise cash and cash equivalents, due from the Central Bank, call loans to other banks, 
and securities purchased under resell agreements as reported in the consolidated balance sheets that 
correspond to the definition of cash and cash equivalents under IAS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows,” as 
endorsed and issued into effect by the FSC. 
 
Financial Instruments 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instruments. 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than 
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted 
from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.265Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss.a.  Financial assetsAll regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade 
date basis.2661)  Measurement categoriesFinancial  assets  are  classified  into  the  following  categories:  Financial  assets  at  FVTPL, 
financial assets at amortised cost, and investments in debt instruments and equity instruments 
at FVTOCI. 
 
a)  Financial asset at FVTPLA  financial  asset  is  classified  as  at  FVTPL  when  the  financial  asset  is  mandatorily 
classified or designated as at FVTPL. Financial assets mandatorily classified as at FVTPL 
include investments in equity instruments which are not designated as at FVTOCI and 
debt instruments that do not meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria. 
 
Financial  assets  at  FVTPL  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value,  with  any  gains  or 
losses  arising  on  remeasurement  recognized  in  profit  or  loss.  The  net  gain  or  loss 
recognized in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial 
asset. 
 
Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 49.b)  Financial assets at amortised costFinancial  assets  that  meet  the  following  conditions  are  subsequently  measured  at 
amortised cost: 
 
i.  The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financialassets in order to collect contractual cash flows; andii.  The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets at amortised cost, including cash and 
cash equivalents, due from the Central Bank and call loans to banks, investments in debt 
instruments  at  amortised  cost,  receivables  and  discounts  and  loans,  are  measured  at 
amortised  cost,  which  equals  the  gross  carrying  amount  determined  by  the  effective 
interest method less any impairment loss. Exchange differences are recognized in profit 
or loss. 
 
Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying 
amount of a financial asset, except for: 
 
i.  Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, for which interest income is 
calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost 
of the financial asset; andii.  Financial  assets  that  are  not  credit-impaired  on  purchase  or  origination  but  have 
subsequently  become  credit-impaired,  for  which  interest  income  is  calculated  by 
applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of such financial assets in 
subsequent reporting periods.A  financial  asset  is  credit-impaired  when  one  or  more  of  the  following  events  have 
occurred:267i.  Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower; 
 
ii.  Breach of contract, such as a default; 
 
iii.  It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or undergo a financialreorganization; oriv.  The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financialdifficulties.c)  Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCIDebt  instruments  that  meet  the  following  conditions  are  subsequently  measured  at 
FVTOCI: 
 
i.  The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by 
both the collecting of contractual cash flows and the selling of the financial  assets; 
andii.  The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.Investments  in  debt  instruments  at  FVTOCI  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value. 
Changes in the carrying amounts of these debt instruments relating to changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates, interest income calculated using the effective interest method 
and impairment losses or reversals are recognized in profit or loss. Other changes in the 
carrying amount of these debt instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income 
and will be reclassified to profit or loss when the investment is disposed of.d)  Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCIOn  initial  recognition,  the  Company  may  make  an  irrevocable  election  to  designate 
investments  in  equity  instruments  as  at  FVTOCI.  Designation  as  at  FVTOCI  is  not 
permitted if the equity investment is held for trading or if it is contingent consideration 
recognized by an acquirer in a business combination. 
 
Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently  measured at fair value 
with  gains  and  losses  arising  from  changes  in  fair  value  recognized  in  other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in other equity. The cumulative gain or loss will 
not be reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the equity investments; instead, they 
will be transferred to retained earnings. 
 
Dividends  on  these  investments  in  equity  instruments  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss 
when the Company’s right to receive the dividends is established, unless the dividends 
clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.2)  Impairment of financial assetsThe Company recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets at 
amortised cost, and investments in debt instruments measured at FVTOCI.   
 
The  Company  always  recognizes  lifetime  expected  credit  losses  (ECLs)  for  accounts 
receivable and lease receivables. For all other financial instruments, the Company recognizes268lifetime  ECLs  when  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  since  initial 
recognition. If, on the other hand, the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased 
significantly  since  initial  recognition,  the  Company  measures  the  loss  allowance  for  that 
financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs. 
 
For  receivables  that  do  not  contain  a  significant  financing  component,  the  allowance  for 
losses is recognized at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.   
 
Expected credit losses reflect the weighted average of credit losses with the respective risks 
of  a  default  occurring  as  the  weights.  A  12-month  ECL  represents  the  portion  of  lifetime 
ECLs that is expected to result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible 
within 12 months after the reporting date. Lifetime ECLs represent the expected credit losses 
that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. 
 
The definition of the financial assets in default is described in Note 50. 
 
The impairment loss of all financial assets is recognized in profit or  loss by a reduction in 
their  carrying  amounts  through  a  loss  allowance  account,  except  for  investments  in  debt 
instruments at FVTOCI, for which the loss allowance is recognized in other comprehensive 
income and the carrying amounts of such financial assets are not reduced. 
 
According to the Regulations Governing the Procedures for Banking Institutions to Evaluate 
Assets and Deal with Non-performing/Non-accrual Loans, the Bank assesses the customers’ 
financial  position,  the  overdue  payments  of  the  principal  and  interest,  and  the  value  of 
collateral  to  classify  credit  assets  into  normal  credit  assets  (excluding  loans  to  the  ROC 
government)  and  unsound  assets  which  should  be  further  classified  as  special  mention, 
substandard, doubtful and losses, for which the minimum provisions are 1%, 2%, 10%, 50%, 
and  100%  of  the  outstanding  balance,  respectively.  Furthermore,  the  FSC  stipulates  that 
banks should recognize provision of at least 1.5% of normal credit assets in mainland China 
(including short-term advances for  trade finance) and loans for mortgage and construction 
loans  that  have  been  classified  as  normal  assets,  and  further  determine  the  allowance  for 
losses  based  on  the  higher  of  the  above-mentioned  provision  and  the  assessment  of  the 
expected credit losses. 
 
The  Company  writes  off  credits  deemed  uncollectable  after  the  write-off  is  proposed  and 
approved  by  the  board  of  directors.  Recoveries  of  credits  written  off  are  recognized  as  a 
reversal of loss provision in the current period.3)  Derecognition of financial assetsThe  Company  derecognizes  a  financial  asset  only  when  the  contractual  rights  to  the  cash 
flows from the asset expire or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party.   
 
On derecognition of a financial asset at amortised cost in its entirety, the difference between 
the  asset’s  carrying  amount  and  the  sum  of  the  consideration  received  and  receivable  is 
recognized  in  profit  or  loss.  On  derecognition  of  an  investment  in  a  debt  instrument  at 
FVTOCI, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration 
received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other 
comprehensive  income  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss.  However,  on  derecognition  of  an 
investment  in an  equity  instrument at  FVTOCI,  the  cumulative  gain  or loss  that  had  been 
recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  transferred  directly  to  retained  earnings, 
without recycling through profit or loss.269b.  Equity instrumentsDebt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or 
as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual agreements and the definitions of a 
financial liability or an equity instrument. 
 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct 
issue costs. 
 
Repurchase  of  the  Company’s  own  equity  instruments  is  recognized  and  deducted  directly  in 
equity. No gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation 
of the Company’s own equity instruments.270c.  Financial liabilities1)  Subsequent measurementExcept for the cases stated below, all financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method: 
 
a)  Financial liabilities at FVTPLFinancial  liabilities  are  classified  as  at  FVTPL  when  the  financial  liabilities  are  either 
held for trading or designated as at FVTPL. 
 
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on 
remeasurement recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or 
loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability.   
 
A financial liability is classified as designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if: 
 
i.  Such  designation  eliminates  or  significantly reduces  a  measurement  or recognitioninconsistency that would otherwise arise; orii.  The financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities 
or both, which is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in 
accordance  with  the  Company’s  documented  risk  management  or  investment 
strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; oriii.  The  contract  contains  one  or  more  embedded  derivatives  so  that  the  entire  hybrid(combined) contract can be designated as at fair value through profit or loss.For  a  financial  liability  designated  as  at  FVTPL,  the  amount  of  changes  in  fair  value 
attributable  to  changes  in  the  credit  risk  of  the  liability  is  presented  in  other 
comprehensive income, and it will not be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. The 
gain or loss accumulated in other comprehensive income will be transferred to retained 
earnings when the financial liabilities are derecognized. The changes in fair value of the 
outstanding liabilities are recognized in profit or loss. If this accounting treatment related 
to credit risk would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch, all changes in fair value 
of the liability are presented in profit or loss. 
 
Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 49.b)  Financial guarantee contractsFinancial guarantee contracts issued by the Company, if not designated as at FVTPL, are 
subsequently measured at the higher of: 
 
i.  The amount of the loss allowance reflecting expected credit loss; and 
 
ii.  The amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount ofincome recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policies.2712)  Derecognition of financial liabilitiesThe difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the 
consideration  paid,  including  any  non-cash  assets  transferred  or  liabilities  assumed,  is 
recognized in profit or loss.d.  DerivativesDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered 
into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the balance sheet date. The resulting 
gain  or  loss  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  immediately.  When  the  fair  value  of  a  derivative 
financial instrument is positive, the derivative is recognized as a financial asset; when the fair 
value of a derivative financial instrument is negative, the derivative is recognized as a financial 
liability. 
 
Derivatives embedded in hybrid contracts that contain financial asset hosts within the scope of 
IFRS 9 are not separated; instead, the classification is determined in accordance with the entire 
hybrid  contract.  Derivatives  embedded  in  non-derivative  host  contracts  that  are  not  financial 
assets  within  the  scope  of IFRS  9  (e.g.  financial  liabilities)  are treated  as  separate  derivatives 
when they meet the definition of a derivative, their risks and characteristics are not closely related 
to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL.e.  Modification of financial instrumentsWhen a financial instrument is modified, the Bank assesses whether the modification will result 
in derecognition. If modification of a financial instrument results in derecognition, it is 
accounted for as derecognition of financial assets or liabilities. If the modification does not 
result in derecognition, the Bank recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or 
the amortized cost of the financial liability based on the modified cash flows discounted at the 
original effective interest rate with any modification gain or loss recognized in profit or loss. 
The cost incurred is adjusted to the carrying amount of the modified financial asset or financial 
liability and amortized over the modified remaining period. 
 
For the changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets or 
financial liabilities resulting from the interest rate benchmark reform, the Bank elects to apply 
the practical expedient in which the changes are accounted for by updating the effective interest 
rate at the time the basis is changed, provided the changes are necessary as a direct consequence 
of the reform and the new basis is economically equivalent to the previous basis. When multiple 
changes are made to a financial asset or a financial liability, the Bank first applies the practical 
expedient to those changes required by interest rate benchmark reform, and then applies the 
requirements of modification of financial instruments to the other changes that cannot apply the 
practical expedient.Investments in Associates 
 
An  associate  is  an  entity  over  which  the  Bank  has  significant  influence  and  which  is  neither  a 
subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. 
 
The  Bank  uses  the  equity  method  to  account  for  its  investments  in  associates.  Under  the  equity 
method,  investments  in  an  associate  are  initially  recognized  at  cost  and  adjusted  thereafter  to 
recognize the Bank’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate. 
The Bank also recognizes the changes in the Bank’s share of the equity of associates attributable to272the Bank. 
 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Bank’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of an associate at  the  date of acquisition is  recognized  as goodwill,  which  is 
included within the carrying amount of the investment and is not amortised. Any excess of the Bank’s 
share  of  the  net  fair  value  of  the  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  over  the  cost  of  acquisition  is 
recognized immediately in profit or loss. 
 
When the Bank subscribes for additional new shares of an associate at a percentage different from its 
existing  ownership  percentage,  the  resulting  carrying  amount  of  the  investment  differs  from  the 
amount of the Bank’s proportionate interest in the associate. The Bank records such a difference as 
an adjustment to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus - 
changes in capital surplus from investments in associates and joint ventures accounted for using the 
equity method. If the Bank’s ownership interest is reduced due to its additional subscription of the 
new shares of the associate, the proportionate amount of the gains or losses previously recognized in 
other comprehensive income in relation to that associate is reclassified to profit or loss on the same 
basis as would be required had the investee directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. When 
the  adjustment  should  be  debited  to  capital  surplus,  but  the  capital  surplus  recognized  from 
investments measured by equity method is insufficient, the shortage is debited to retained earnings. 
 
When the Bank’s share of losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interest in that associate (which 
includes any carrying amount of the investment accounted for using the equity method and long-term 
interests  that,  in  substance,  form  part  of  the  Bank’s  net  investment  in  the  associate),  the  Bank 
discontinues  recognizing  its  share  of  further  loss,  if  any.  Additional  losses  and  liabilities  are 
recognized only to the extent that the Bank has incurred legal obligations, or constructive obligations, 
or made payments on behalf of that associate. 
 
The entire carrying amount of an investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single 
asset by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized 
is  not  allocated  to  any  asset,  including  goodwill,  which  forms  part  of  the  carrying  amount  of  the 
investment.  Any  reversal  of  that  impairment  loss  is  recognized  to  the  extent  that  the  recoverable 
amount of the investment subsequently increases. 
 
The Bank discontinues the use of the equity method from the date on which its investment ceases to 
be an associate. Any retained investment is measured at fair value at that date, and the fair value is 
regarded  as  the  investment’s  fair  value  on  initial  recognition  as  a  financial  asset.  The  difference 
between the previous carrying amount of the associate attributable to the retained interest and its fair 
value  is  included  in  the  determination  of  the  gain  or  loss  on  disposal  of  the  associate.  The  Bank 
accounts for all amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that 
associate on the same basis as would be required had that associate directly disposed of the related 
assets or liabilities. If an investment in an associate becomes an investment in a joint venture or an 
investment in a joint venture becomes an investment in an associate, the Bank continues to apply the 
equity method and does not remeasure the retained interest. 
 
Profits  or  losses resulting  from  downstream  transactions  are eliminated  in  full  only  in the  Bank’s 
financial statements. Profits and losses resulting from upstream transactions and transactions between 
associates are recognized only in the Bank’s financial statements only to the extent of interests in the 
associates that are not related to the Bank. 
 
Nonperforming Loans 
 
Under the “Regulations Governing the Procedures for Banking Institutions to Evaluate Assets and 
Deal  with  Nonperforming/Nonaccrual  Loans”  issued  by  the  authorities,  loans  and  other  credits273(including the accrued interest) that remain unpaid on their maturity are transferred immediately to 
nonperforming loans if the transfer is approved by the board of directors.   
 
Nonperforming  loans  transferred  from  loans  are  recognized  as  discounts  and  loans,  and  those 
transferred from other credits are recognized as other financial assets. 
 
Repurchase and Resale Transactions 
 
Securities  purchased  under  resell agreements and securities sold  under  repurchase  agreements  are 
generally  treated  as  collateralized  financing  transactions.  Interest  earned  on  reverse  repurchase 
agreements or interest incurred on repurchase agreements is recognized as interest income or interest 
expense over the life of each agreement. 
 
Property and Equipment 
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
loss. 
 
Freehold  land is not  depreciated.  Depreciation  of  property  and  equipment  is  recognized  using the 
straight-line method. Each significant part is depreciated separately. If the lease term of an item of 
property and equipment is shorter than its useful life, such asset is depreciated over its lease term. 
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each 
reporting period, with the effects of any changes in the estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. 
 
On derecognition of an item of property and equipment, the difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset is recognized in profit or loss.274Investment Properties 
 
Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation. Investment 
properties also include land held for a currently undetermined future use. 
 
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs, and are subsequently 
measured using the fair value model. Changes in the fair value of investment properties are included 
in profit or loss for the period in which they arise. 
 
On derecognition of an investment property, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset is included in profit or loss. 
 
The Bank decides to transfer assets to or from investment property based on the actual use of assets. 
 
For a transfer from the property and equipment classification to investment property based on the 
actual use of assets, any difference between the fair value of the property at the transfer date and its 
previous carrying amount is recognized in other comprehensive income. 
 
Goodwill 
 
Goodwill arising  from  the acquisition  of a  business is  carried  at  cost  as  established  at the  date  of 
acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment loss. 
 
For  the  purposes  of  impairment  testing,  goodwill  is  allocated  to  each  of  the  Company’s  cash-
generating units or groups of cash-generating units (referred to as “cash-generating units”) that are 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
 
A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or 
more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired, by comparing its carrying 
amount,  including  the  attributed  goodwill,  with  its  recoverable  amount.  However,  if  the  goodwill 
allocated to a cash-generating unit was acquired in a business combination during the current annual 
period, that unit shall be tested for  impairment before the end of the current annual period. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss 
is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then pro rata 
to the other assets of the unit based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment 
loss  is  recognized  directly  in  profit  or  loss.  Any  impairment  loss  recognized  on  goodwill  is  not 
reversed in subsequent periods. 
 
If goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and the entity disposes of an operation within 
that unit, the goodwill associated with the operation which is disposed of is included in the carrying 
amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal and is measured on the basis 
of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.275Foreclosed Collateral 
 
Collateral  assumed  (recorded  in  other  assets)  are  recognized  at  cost,  which  includes  the  assumed 
prices and any necessary repairs to make the collateral saleable, and evaluated at the lower of cost or 
net realizable value as of the balance sheet date. 
 
Intangible Assets (Excluding Goodwill)a.  Intangible assets acquired separatelyIntangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are initially measured at cost 
and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment 
losses. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful lives, residual 
values, and amortization methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect 
of any changes in the estimates accounted for on a prospective basis.b.  DerecognitionOn derecognition of an intangible asset, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset is recognized in profit or loss.Impairment of Property and Equipment, Right-of-use Asset and Intangible Assets (ExcludingGoodwill)At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its property and 
equipment, right-of-use asset and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered any impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss. Corporate assets are allocated to cash-generating units on a reasonable and consistent basis of 
allocation. 
 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. If the recoverable 
amount  of  an  asset  or  cash-generating  unit  is  estimated  to  be  less  than  its  carrying  amount,  the 
carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount, with the 
resulting impairment loss recognized in profit or loss. 
 
When an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the corresponding asset, 
cash-generating  unit  or  assets  related  to  contract  costs  is  increased  to  the  revised  estimate  of  its 
recoverable amount, but only to the extent of the carrying amount that would have been determined 
had no impairment loss been recognized on the asset, cash-generating unit or assets related to contract 
costs in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss.276Assets Held for Sale 
 
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through 
a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when 
the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. To 
meet the criteria for the sale being highly probable, the appropriate level of management must be 
committed to the sale, and the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale 
within 1 year from the date of classification. 
 
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell. Such assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated. 
 
Leasing 
 
At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease.a.  The Company as lessorLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of a lease transfer substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
 
Lease  payments  (less  any  lease  incentives  payable)  from  operating  leases  are  recognized  as 
income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the relevant leases. Initial direct costs incurred 
in  obtaining  operating  leases  are  added  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  the  underlying  assets  and 
recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.   
 
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as income in the 
periods in which they are incurred. 
 
When a lease includes both land and building elements, the Company assesses the classification 
of  each  element  separately  as  a  finance  or  an  operating  lease  based  on  the  assessment  as  to 
whether substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of each element have been 
transferred to the Company. The lease payments are allocated between the land and the building 
elements in proportion to the relative fair values of the leasehold interests in the land element and 
building element of the lease at the inception of a contract. If the allocation of the lease payments 
can  be  made  reliably,  each  element  is  accounted  for  separately  in  accordance  with  its  lease 
classification.  When  the  lease  payments  cannot  be  allocated  reliably  between  the  land  and 
building elements, the entire lease is generally classified as a finance lease unless it is clear that 
both elements are operating leases; in which case, the entire lease is classified as an operating 
lease.b.  The Company as lesseeThe  Company  recognizes  right-of-use  assets  and  lease  liabilities  for  all  leases  at  the 
commencement  date  of  the  lease,  except  for  short-term  leases  and  low-value  asset  leases 
accounted  for  applying  a  recognition  exemption  where  lease  payments  are  recognized  as 
expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. 
 
Right-of-use  assets are  initially  measured at cost,  which  comprises  the  initial  measurement  of 
lease liabilities adjusted for lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any 
initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs needed to restore the underlying assets, and 
less  any  lease  incentives  received.  Right-of-use  assets  are  subsequently  measured  at  cost  less277accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease 
liabilities. Right-of-use assets are presented on a separate line in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates 
to the earlier of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. 
 
Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, which comprise 
fixed payments, in-substance fixed payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index 
or a rate, residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is 
reasonably certain to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the 
lease term reflects such termination, less any lease incentives receivable. The lease payments are 
discounted using the interest rate implicit in a lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that 
rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. 
 
Subsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
with interest expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a 
change in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, a change in the 
assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, or a change in future lease payments 
resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, the Company 
remeasures  the  lease  liabilities  with  a  corresponding  adjustment  to  the  right-of-use-assets. 
However,  if  the  carrying  amount  of  the  right-of-use  assets  is  reduced  to  zero,  any  remaining 
amount of the remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss. Lease liabilities are presented on a 
separate line in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in 
the periods in which they are incurred.Provisions 
 
Provisions are recognized when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result 
of  a  past  event,  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying  economic  benefits  will  be 
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.   
 
Provisions  are  the  best  estimate  of  the  consideration  required  to  settle  a  present  obligation  at  the 
consolidated  balance  sheet  date,  taking  the  risks  and  uncertainties  on  the  obligation  into  account. 
Provisions are measured using the discounted cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation. 
 
Employee Benefitsa.  Short-term employee benefitsLiabilities  recognized  in  respect  of  short-term  employee  benefits  are  measured  at  the 
undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related services.b.  Retirement benefitsPayments  to  defined contribution  retirement  benefit  plans are recognized  as  an expense  when 
employees have rendered services entitling them to the contributions. 
 
Defined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined 
benefit retirement benefit plans are determined using the projected unit credit method. Service 
cost  (including  current  service  cost  and  past  service  cost)  and  net  interest  on  the  net  defined278benefit  liabilities  (assets)  are  recognized  as  employee  benefits  expense  in  the  period in  which 
they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to 
the  asset  ceiling  and  the  return  on  plan  assets  (excluding  interest),  is  recognized  in  other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other 
comprehensive  income  is  reflected immediately  in  other equity  and  will  not be reclassified to 
profit or loss.   
 
Net  defined  benefit  liabilities  (assets)  represent  the  actual  deficit  (surplus)  in  the  Company’s 
defined benefit plan. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of 
any refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.c.  Termination benefitsA liability for a termination benefit is recognized at the earlier of when the Bank can no longer 
withdraw  the  offer  of  the  termination  benefit  and  when  the  Bank  recognizes  any  related 
restructuring costs.279d.  Employee preferential interest rate depositsThe  Bank  offers  preferential  interest  rate  deposits  for  its  current  employees,  which  include 
preferential deposits and post-retirement preferential deposits for its current employees as well 
as  preferential  deposits  for  its  retired  employees,  limited  to  a  certain  amount.  The  difference 
between the preferential interest rate and the market rate is considered as employee benefits. 
 
In accordance with Article 30 of the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports 
by  Public  Banks,  the  excess  of  the  interests  incurred  in  post-employment  preferential  interest 
deposits over those imputed at the market rate should qualify as post-employment benefits under 
IAS  19  “Employee  Benefits”  since  the  beneficiaries  are  retired  employees.  The  retirement 
benefits should be accrued by actuarial method.Income Tax 
 
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.a.  Current taxIncome  tax  payable  (recoverable)  is  based  on  taxable  profit  (loss)  for  the  year  determined 
according to the applicable tax laws of each tax jurisdiction. 
 
According to the Income Tax Act in the ROC, an additional tax on unappropriated earnings is 
provided for as income tax in the year the stockholders approve to retain earnings. 
 
Adjustments of prior years’ tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year’s tax 
provision. 
 
Since 2002, in accordance with Article 49 of the Financial Holding Company Act, the Bank’s 
financial holding company, as the taxpayer, and the Bank elected to jointly declare and report 
income tax of profit-seeking enterprise and tax surcharge on surplus retained earnings of profit-
seeking enterprise in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act. Additional 
tax payable or tax receivable due to the joint declaration of income tax is recognized under the 
payables or receivables for allocation of integrated income tax system account.b.  Deferred taxDeferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of 
taxable profit.   
 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred 
tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is 
probable  that  taxable  profits  will  be  available  against  which  those  deductible  temporary 
differences can be utilized.   
 
Deferred  tax  liabilities  are  recognized  for  taxable  temporary  differences  associated  with 
investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Bank 
can  control  the  reversal  of  the  temporary  difference  and  it  is  probable  that  the  temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible 
temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are recognized only to the 
extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the280benefits  of  the  temporary  differences  and  these  differences  are  expected  to  reverse  in  the 
foreseeable future. 
 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available 
to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. A previously unrecognized deferred tax asset is 
also reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it has become 
probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.   
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period in which the liabilities are settled or the assets are realized, based on tax rates and tax laws 
that  have  been  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  by  the  end  of  the  reporting  period.  The 
measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets should reflect the tax consequences that would 
follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to 
recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. 
 
If investment properties measured using the fair value model are non-depreciable assets, or are 
held under a business model whose objective is not to consume substantially all of the economic 
benefits embodied in the assets over time, the carrying amounts of such assets are presumed to 
be recovered entirely through sale.c.  Current and deferred taxesCurrent and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that 
are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity; in which case, the current 
and  deferred  taxes  are  also  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  or  directly  in  equity, 
respectively.Recognition of Interest Revenue and Expense 
 
Except for the financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the interest revenue 
and interest expense arising from all interest-bearing financial instruments are calculated using the 
effective interest method in accordance with the relevant regulations and standards and recognized 
in the consolidated statement of profit or loss under “interest revenue” and “interest expense” items. 
 
Recognition of Service Fee Revenue and Expense 
 
The service fee revenue and expense are generally recognized upon completion of the service to the 
customer for loan or other services; the service fee earned by the execution of the major project is 
recognized at the  completion  of  the  major  project;  the  service fee  revenue  and expense related to 
subsequent  lending  services  are  either  recognized  over  the  service  period  or  included  in  the 
calculation of the effective interest rate on loans and receivables. 
 
Customer Loyalty Program 
 
The  points  earned  by  customers  under  loyalty  programs  are  treated  as  multiple-element  revenue 
arrangements, in which consideration is allocated to the goods or services and the award credits based 
on their fair values through the eyes of the customer. The consideration is not recognized as earnings 
at the time  of  the  original sales transaction  but at the  time  when the  points  are redeemed  and  the 
obligation is fulfilled.2815.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATIONUNCERTAINTY 
 
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, the Company’s management is required to 
make judgments, estimates and assumptions on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are 
not  readily  apparent  from  other  sources.  The  estimates  and  associated  assumptions  are  based  on 
historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates. 
 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that 
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future 
periods. 
 
Assessment of Impairment of Loans 
 
The assessment of impairment of loans is based on the value of the collateral, amount of principal 
and interest due, and the length of the overdue period. Changes in credit ratings on individual assets 
and the status of the collection are also considered during classification of the loans. The Company 
uses judgment in making these assumptions and in selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, 
based on the Company’s historical experience, existing market conditions as well as forward looking 
estimates at the end of each reporting period. The inputs include risk of default and expected loss 
rates. For details of the key assumptions and inputs used, refer to Note 50.2826.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS20202021December 31Cash on hand

respectively, and the interest is payable annually. The Bank is authorized by the authorities to redeem 
the US$660 million of bonds at book value after 12 years and after fulfilling the specified conditions. 
 
In December 2014, the Bank was authorized to issue unsubordinated financial debentures amounting 
to US$180 million (thirty-years), which were subsequently issued on March 30, 2015. In addition to 
the redemption of bonds by the exercise of call options, the bonds are redeemable on maturity; the 
bonds were issued in the form of zero-coupon bonds, and the internal rate of return is 4.20%. The 
bonds have been fully redeemed on March 30, 2020.

US$195 million (thirty-years), which were subsequently issued on April 11, 2017. In addition to the

hedge  against  the  fair  value  risk  resulting  from  interest  rate  fluctuations.  For  the  years  ended 
December 31, 2021 and 2020, such interest rate swaps were valued with a net loss of $2,445,367 
thousand and a net gain of $1,921,169 thousand, respectively.2869.  FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVEINCOMEInvestments in equity instrumentsDomestic listed shares

Accordingly,  the  management  elected  to  designate  these  investments  in  equity  instruments  as  at

profit or loss would not be consistent with the Company’s strategy of holding these investments for 
long-term purposes.

31, 2021 and 2020 were $747,518 thousand and $803,011 thousand, respectively, and the remaining

The  Company  monitors  the  external  credit  rating  information  and  price  movements  of  their 
investments in debt instruments in order to assess  whether there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk since initial recognition. 
 
The Company takes into consideration the multi-period default probability table for each credit rating 
supplied by external rating agencies, the current financial condition of debtors, industry forecasts, 
rating of securities issued by credit rating agencies and recovery rates of different types of bonds to 
assess the 12-month or lifetime expected credit losses.

Some of the Bank’s properties are held for earning rental income or for capitalappreciation, while some are for self-use. When the part held for self-use is less than5% of the individual real estate, the real estate is classified as investment properties.c.  The fair values of the Bank’s investment properties were based on the valuationscarried out by qualified real estate appraisers in Taiwan in accordance with the“Regulations on Real Estate Appraisal”. The valuation dates were December 31, 2021and 2020, respectively.Appraiser OfficeDecember 312021REPro KnightFrank Real Estate Appraiser Firm    Xiang-Yi, Hsu; 
Hong-Xu, Wu; 
You-Xiang, Cai2020Xiang-Yi, Hsu; 
You-Xiang, Cai306The fair value is supported by observable evidence in the market. The main appraisal approaches 
applied  include  the  income  approach  (such  as  discounted  cash  flow  model  and  direct 
capitalization approach), comparison approach and cost approach. The significant unobservable 
inputs mainly include discount rates and the related adjustments, and categorized as level 3 of 
fair value hierarchy. 
 
1)  As office buildings have market liquidity and the rentals are similar to those of comparable 
properties  in  neighboring  areas,  the  fair  values  have  been  mainly  determined  using  the 
comparison approach and the income approach. 
 
Net rental income is based on current market practices, assuming an annual rental increase 
between 0% to 1.5% to extrapolate the total income of the underlying property, excluding 
losses as a result of idle and other reasons and related operation costs. 
 
According to the ROC Real Estate Appraisers Association Gazette No. 5, the house tax is 
determined based on the reference tables of current house values provided by each city/county 
to  estimate  the  total  current  house  value  considering  the  area  of  the  subject  property  and 
related public utilities. House tax is calculated based on the tax rates in the House Tax Act 
and the actual payment data. 
 
Land  value  tax  is  calculated  based  on  the  changes  in  the  announced  land  values  of  the 
underlying property in the past years and the actual payment data. 
 
According  to  the  ROC  Real  Estate  Appraisers  Association  Gazette  No.  5,  replacement 
allowance for significant renovation cost is calculated based on 10% of construction costs 
and amortised over its estimated useful life of 20 years.

managed defined contribution plan. Under the LPA, the Bank makes monthly contributions equal 
to 6% of each employee’s monthly salary to employees’ pension accounts in the Bureau of Labor 
Insurance. 
 
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized expenses of $427,274 
thousand  and  $413,783  thousand  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  comprehensive  income  in 
accordance with the defined contribution plan, respectively.b.  Defined benefit planThe defined benefit plan adopted by domestic branches of the Bank under the Labor Standards 
Law is operated by the government of the ROC. Pension benefits are calculated on the basis of 
the length of service and average monthly salaries of the 6 months before retirement. The Bank 
contributes a fixed proportion of total monthly salaries and wages to a pension fund administered 
by the pension fund monitoring committee. Pension contributions are deposited in the Bank of 
Taiwan in the committee’s name. Before the end of each year, the Bank assesses the balance in 
the pension fund. If the amount of the balance in the pension fund is inadequate to pay retirement 
benefits  for  employees  who  conform  to  retirement  requirements  in  the  next  year,  the  Bank  is 
required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made before the end of March 
of the next year. The pension fund is managed by the Bureau of Labor Funds, Ministry of Labor 
(the “Bureau”); the Bank had no right to influence the investment policy and strategy.313The amounts included in the consolidated balance sheets in respect of the Company’s defined 
benefit plans were as follows:

(464 )$2,598,776314Through the defined benefit plans under the Labor Standards Law, the Bank is exposed to the 
following risks: 
 
1)  Investment  risk:  The  plan  assets  are  invested  in  domestic  and  foreign  equity  and  debt 
securities, bank deposits, etc. The investment is conducted at the discretion of the Bureau or 
under  the  mandated  management.  However,  in  accordance  with  relevant  regulations,  the 
return generated by plan assets shall not be below the interest rate for a 2-year time deposit 
with local banks.2)  Interest risk: A decrease in interest rate will increase the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plans’ debt 
investments.3)  Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated using the future 
salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salaries of the plan participants will 
increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation.December 31The actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out by 
qualified actuaries. The significant assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations 
were as follows: 
 
 
 
 
Discount rate(s) 
Expected rate(s) of salary increase   
 
If possible reasonable changes in each of the significant actuarial assumptions will occur and all 
other assumptions will remain constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would 
have increased (decreased) as follows:

15%  of  the  Bank’s  paid-in-capital.  In  the  event  that  the  accumulated  legal  reserve  equals  or 
exceeds the Bank’s paid-in capital or the Bank is sound in both its finance and business operations 
and had already set aside a legal reserve in compliance with the Banking Act, the restrictions 
stipulated above shall not apply.d.  Special reserveAccording to Rule No. 1030006415 issued by the FSC, on the first-time adoption of the fair value 
model  for  investment  properties,  the  Bank  should  appropriate  as  special  reserve  an  amount 
equivalent to the amount of the net increase in fair value transferred to retained earnings. In the 
subsequent  fair  value  measurement  of  investment  properties,  the  incremental  fair  value  of 
investment properties is recognized in profit or loss and the same amount is appropriated from 
retained earnings to the special reserve. For any subsequent reversal of accumulated incremental 
fair value of investment properties upon disposal of investment properties, the reversed amount 
can be distributed accordingly. 
 
According to Rule No. 1090150022, Rule No. 1010012865 issued by the FSC and the directive 
titled “Questions and Answers for Special Reserves Appropriated Following Adoption of IFRSs,” 
the Bank should appropriate to or reverse from its special reserve certain specified amounts. Any 
special reserve appropriated may be reversed to the extent that the net debit balance reverses, and 
thereafter distributed. 
 
The above special reserve may be used to offset a deficit; if the reserve has reached at least 50% 
of the paid-in capital, half of this special reserve may be capitalized.   
 
According to Rule No. 10510001510 issued by the FSC, the Bank should appropriate between 
0.5% and 1% of net income after tax to the special reserve during the appropriation of earnings 
from 2016 through 2018. Since 2017, the Company is allowed to reverse special reserve at the 
amount of the costs of employee transfer and arrangement in connection with the development 
of financial technology.

profit shall be first utilized for paying taxes and offsetting deficits of prior years, if any. If the320legal  reserve  is  less  than  the  paid-in  capital,  profit  shall  be  appropriated  to  legal  reserve  and 
special  reserve  in  accordance  with  the  laws  and  regulations,  and  then  any  remaining  profit 
together with any undistributed retained earnings shall be used by the Bank’s board of directors

which should be resolved by the shareholder.

Lee & Li, Attorneys-at-Law and SanDisk Corporation of USA alleged that the embezzlement 
case  of  Liu  Wei-Chieh  (an  employee  of  Lee  &  Li),  which  occurred  in  October  2003  was 
caused  by  the  negligence  of  the  Bank  in its  operation,  and the  plaintiffs  claimed  damages 
from the Bank in the amount of approximately $991,002 thousand. The case has been pending 
in the court since July 2007, and the Bank won favorable decisions in both the first and second 
instances. Although the Supreme Court reversed the original second-instance judgements, the 
Bank again won a favorable decision in the second instance on August 25, 2021. Lee & Li is 
appealing to the Supreme Court currently. Both the Bank and its attorneys hold that this case 
will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Bank.347December 312021$  1,292,761

THE BANK, CATHAY FINANCIAL HOLDING CO., LTD., AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES 
 
The Bank has entered into cross-selling marketing contracts with Cathay Life Insurance Co., Ltd., 
Cathay Century Insurance Co., Ltd. and Cathay Securities Co., Ltd. The contracts cover joint use of 
operation sites and facilities as well as cross-selling marketing personnel. 
 
The Bank has entered into cooperation contracts with Cathay Financial Holding Co., Ltd., Cathay 
Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Cathay Century Insurance Co., Ltd., and Cathay Securities Co., Ltd. for the 
joint use of information equipment and the development, operation, maintenance and management 
of information systems. 
 
The  related  expenses  are  allocated  to  each  subsidiary  directly  by  the  business  nature  or  to  the 
cooperating companies by other reasonable methods.49.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSa.  Information on fair value hierarchyFair value is the price that a market participant can receive from selling an asset or pay for settling 
a liability in an orderly transaction on a measurement date. 
 
Financial instruments are accounted for at fair value on original recognition, and in many cases, 
usually refers to the  transaction price. On subsequent measurement, except for some financial 
instruments  that  are  measured  at  amortised  cost,  they  are  measured  at  fair  value.  The  best 
evidence of fair value is the open quotation in an active market. If there is no active market for 
the financial instruments, the Bank uses an evaluation model or refers to Bloomberg, Reuters or 
counterparty quotes to measure the fair value of financial instruments.b.  The definitions of each level of the fair value hierarchy are shown below:1)  Level 1Level 1 financial instruments are traded in an active market in which there are quoted prices 
for identical assets and liabilities. An active market has the following characteristics: 
 
a)  All financial instruments in the market are homogeneous. 
 
b)  There are willing buyers and sellers in the market all the time. 
 
c)  The public can access the price information easily. 
 
The products in this level, such as listed stock and beneficiary securities, usually have high 
liquidity or are traded in the exchanges.2)  Level 2The products in this level have fair values that can be inferred either directly or indirectly 
through observable inputs other than quoted prices in an active market. The observable inputs 
are as follows:352a)  Quoted prices of similar products in an active market. This means the fair value can be 
derived from the current trading prices of similar products, and whether they are similar 
products should be judged on the characteristics and trading rules. The fair price valuation 
in this  circumstance  may  be  adjusted due to time  differences,  trading  rule  differences, 
transaction  prices  involving  related  parties,  and  the  correlation  of  price  between  the 
product itself and similar goods;b)  Quoted prices for identical or similar financial instruments in inactive markets; 
 
c)  For the marking-to-model method, the inputs to the model should be observable (such as 
interest rates, yield curves and volatilities). The observable inputs mean that they can be 
obtained from the market and can reflect the expectation of market participants;d)  Inputs that are derived from observable market data through correlation or other means. 
 
The fair values of products categorized in this level are usually calculated using a valuation 
model generally accepted by the market; such products are forward contracts, cross-currency 
swap contracts, simple interest bearing bonds, convertible bonds and commercial paper.3)  Level 3The fair values of the products in this level are typically based on management assumptions 
or expectations other than the direct market data. For example, historical volatility used in 
valuing  options  is  an  unobservable  input  because  it  cannot  represent  the  entire  market 
participants’ expectation on future volatility. 
 
The products in this level are part of emerging stocks, unlisted shares, complex derivative 
financial instruments or products with prices that are provided by brokers, such as complex 
foreign exchange options.353c.  Measured at fair value on a recurring basis1)  The fair value hierarchies of the Company’s financial instruments, which are measured at fairvalue on a recurring basis, were as follows:ItemTotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3December 31, 2021Measured at fair value on a recurring

--5,361,83271,410,04736,35066,011,8655,361,8322)  Financial instruments measured at fair valueFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in 
an orderly transaction between willing market participants with full understanding of the sale 
or transfer transaction. The fair values of financial instruments at fair value through profit or 
loss,  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  and  hedging 
derivative  financial  instruments  with  quoted  prices  in  an  active  market  are  based  on  their 
market prices; financial instruments with no quoted prices in an active market are estimated 
by valuation methods. 
 
a)  Marking to marketThis method should be considered first when determining fair value. The following are 
the principles to follow when marking to market: 
 
i.  Ensure the consistency and integrity of market data. 
 
ii.  Market  data  should  be  obtained  from  publicly  available,  easily  accessible  andindependent sources.iii.  Listed securities with tradable prices should be valued at closing prices. 
 
iv.  Evaluation of unlisted securities that lack tradable closing prices should use quoted 
prices from independent brokers and comply with the rules issued by the authorities.355b)  Marking to modelThe  use  of  marking  to  model  is  suggested  if  marking  to  market  is  infeasible.  This 
valuation  method  is  based  upon  model  inputs  that  are  used  to  derive  the  value  of  the 
trading positions. The Bank uses the same estimations and assumptions as those used by 
market participants to determine the fair value. 
 
The Company uses the forward rates provided by Reuters to estimate the fair values of 
forward contracts, foreign exchange swap contracts, interest rate swap and cross-currency 
swap contacts and the discounted cash flow method to calculate the fair value of each 
contract. For foreign exchange option transactions, the Company uses the option pricing 
models  which  are  generally  used  by  other  market  participants  (e.g.,  the  Black-Scholes 
model) to calculate the fair value of the contract.3)  Fair value adjustmentsCredit risk valuation adjustments 
 
Credit  risk  valuation  adjustments  refer  to  the  fair  value  of  the  Over  The  Counter  (OTC) 
derivative financial commodity contracts, which also reflects the credit risk of both parties, 
and can be mainly divided into “credit value adjustments” and “debit value adjustments”: 
 
a)  Credit  value  adjustments  (CVA):  Adjustment  to  a  transaction  in  a  non-concentrated 
trading  market,  that  is, the  adjustment  of  a  derivatives  contract  evaluation  in  the  OTC 
transaction, which reflects the possibility that the Company may not be able to collect the 
full market value or the counterparty may default on the repayment of the fair value.b)  Debit  value  adjustments  (DVA):  Adjustment  to  a  transaction  in  a  non-concentrated 
trading  market,  that  is, the  adjustment  of  a  derivatives  contract  evaluation  in  the  OTC 
transaction, which reflects the possibility that the Company may not be able to pay the 
full market value or the Company may default on the repayment of the fair value. 
 
Both  CVA  and  DVA  are  concepts  of  estimated  loss,  calculated  as  the  probability  of 
default (PD) multiplied by the loss given default (LGD) and multiplied by the exposure 
at default (EAD). 
 
The Bank uses the fair value of OTC derivatives to calculate the amount of exposure at 
default (EAD). 
 
The Bank uses 60% as the loss given default based on the recommendation of “IFRS 13 
CVA and DVA Related Disclosure Guidelines” of the stock exchange. The Bank may 
use other loss given default assumptions based on the nature of risk and available figures. 
 
The  Company  incorporates  the  credit  risk  assessment  adjustment  into  the  fair  value 
calculation  of  financial  instruments  to  reflect  the  counterparty’s  credit  risk  and  the 
Company’s credit quality.4)  Transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the periodThere  were  no  significant  transfers  between  Level  1  and  Level  2  for  the  years  ended

The Company’s risk management department is responsible for validating the fair value 
measurements and ensuring that the results of the valuation are in line with market 
conditions, based on independent and reliable inputs which are consistent with other 
information, and represent exercisable prices. The department analyzes the movements in 
the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be re-measured or re-assessed as per 
the Company’s accounting policies at each reporting date.d.  Financial instruments that were not measured at fair value1)  Information on fair valueExcept as detailed in the following table, the management considers the carrying amounts of 
financial assets and financial liabilities recognized in the consolidated financial statements as 
approximate fair values or that the fair values cannot be reasonably measured.

instruments that are not measured at fair value are as follows: 
 
a)  Cash  and  cash  equivalents,  due  from  the  Central  Bank  and  call  loans  to  other  banks, 
securities purchased under resell agreements, receivables, other financial assets, due to 
the  Central  Bank  and  other  banks,  call  loans  from  the  Central  Bank  and  other  banks, 
securities sold under repurchase agreements, payables, deposits and remittances whose 
maturity date is very near or the future payment price approximates the carrying amount 
take the amount in the book on the balance sheet date as the fair value.b)  Discounts and loans, deposits, financial debentures and structured commodity principals 
are all interest-bearing financial assets/liabilities whose carrying amount is taken as the 
current  fair  value.  The  carrying  amount  of  nonperforming  loan  is  the  estimated 
recoverable amount after deduction of allowance for impairment loss, hence its carrying 
amount is used as its fair value.c)  If an investment in a debt instrument at amortised cost has a public quoted price in an 
active market, the market price is used as its fair value; if no market price is available for 
reference,  a  valuation  method  is  used  to  estimate  the  fair  value.  The  estimates  and 
assumptions used by the Bank in the valuation method are consistent with the information 
and assumptions used by market participants in the estimation of the fair value of financial 
products.50.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTThe  Bank’s  risk  control  and  hedging  strategy  follows  the  requirements  of  the  customer  service-
oriented  banking  industry  and  regulatory  environment.  In  order  to  comply  with  the  above 
requirements, the Bank adopts different risk management methods to identify its risks and the Bank 
follows  the  spirit  and  regulation  of  the  “Basel  Accord”  to  keep  strengthening  its  assets  and  the 
practices of capital management to maintain the best capital adequacy ratio.   
 
The Bank has set up its risk management committee, whose responsibilities are as follows:a.  To  amend  the risk  management  policies, risk  appetite  or  risk  tolerance and  report  the  aboveissues to the board of directors for approval;360b.  To  manage  and  decide the  strategy  about  the  Bank’s credit  risk,  market  risk  and  operationalrisk;c.  To report the significant risk management issues, such as credit ratings, market assessment andrisk indicators;d.  To analyze the issues that the Bank’s business unit brought up for discussion; 
 
e.  Other issues. 
 
The Bank organized a risk management group to monitor, lead, develop, and establish the integral 
risk management framework.a.  Credit riskCredit risk represents the risk of loss that the Bank would incur if a counterparty fails to perform 
its contractual obligations. Sources of credit risk cover both on and off-balance sheet accounts. 
 
The Bank, Indovina Bank and CUBCN Bank 
 
The  approval  unit  of  Cathay  United  Bank,  Indovina  Bank  and  CUBCN  Bank’s  credit  risk 
strategies  and  significant  risk  policies  is  the  board  of  directors.  Cathay  United  Bank’s  Risk 
Management  Division  and  its  subdivisions  assist  in  reviewing  and  monitoring  risk  tolerance 
ability  and  risk  control  procedures;  and  establish  credit  approval  processes,  credit  limit 
management,  credit  rating  information,  collateral  information,  periodic  reviews  and  remedial 
management systems. The subdivisions include the Market Risk Management Division, Credit 
and  Operational  Management  Division,  Consumer  Finance  Credit  Management  Division, 
Corporate Finance Credit Management Division, and International Credit Management Division. 
Indovina Bank established the credit risk management department to perform risk management. 
The credit risk departments for loans, investments, and financial instruments or contracts are the 
executive unit of credit risk control. The credit quality of the Company is strictly controlled in 
advance. After the loan is approved, lending portfolios are reviewed according to the Bank and 
Indovina Bank’s loan review regulations and deficiencies are tracked to strengthen post-event 
risk management. 
 
The Bank, Indovina Bank and CUBCN Bank maintain a strict policy to evaluate customers’ credit 
ratings  when  providing  loans,  loan  commitments  and  commercial  letters  of  credit.  Certain 
customers  are  required  to  provide  appropriate  collateral  for  the  related  loans,  and  the  Bank, 
Indovina Bank and CUBCN Bank retain the legal right to foreclose or liquidate the collateral, 
which effectively  reduces  the  credit risk  of  the  Bank,  Indovina  Bank  and  CUBCN  Bank.  The 
disclosure of the maximum credit exposure does not take into account any collateral held or other 
enhancements. 
 
CUBC Bank 
 
The approval unit of CUBC Bank’s credit risk policies is the board of directors, and the policies 
are then implemented by the CUBC Bank’s credit risk management department. These credit risk 
policies form the basic principles for all credit risk situations faced by CUBC Bank and also serve 
as the basis for the development of CUBC Bank’s various businesses in Cambodia. 
 
When CUBC Bank provides loans, the approval unit is decided based on credit amount. The loan 
committee is the top lending authority within CUBC Bank, and is composed of CUBC Bank’s361senior management. It is in charge of approval of all credit in excess of CUBC Bank’s lending 
authorities. Certain customers are required to provide appropriate collateral for the related loans, 
and CUBC Bank retains the legal right to foreclose or liquidate the collateral, which effectively 
reduces Cathay United Bank’s credit risk. The disclosure of the maximum credit exposure does 
not take into account any collateral held or other enhancements. 
 
Judgment of significant increase in credit risk after initial recognition 
 
The Bank 
 
The Bank assesses the movements in default risk during the expected lifetime of various types of 
credit assets at each reporting date to determine if the credit risk has increased significantly since 
the  initial  recognition.  For  the  assessment,  the  Bank  considers  reasonable  and  corroborative 
information (including prospective information) that indicates a significant increase in credit risk 
since initial recognition. The key indicators for consideration include: 
 
1)  Quantitative indicatorsa)  Changes in credit ratingWhen the credit rating at the reporting date has decreased to some extent compared with 
that  on  initial  recognition,  credit  risk  is  deemed  to  have  increased  significantly  since 
initial recognition.b)  Information on the overdue status of a contractWhen the contract payment is overdue for 30 days to 90 days at the reporting date, credit 
risk is deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition.2)  Qualitative indicatorsWhen the information observed at the reporting date meets the following conditions, credit 
risk is deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition. 
 
a)  Bounced checks are reported. 
 
b)  Auditors have expressed significant doubt on the entity’s ability to continue as a goingconcern.c)  Auditors’ opinion - adverse opinion. 
 
d)  Auditors’ opinion - disclaimer of opinion. 
 
e)  The stock was placed in full-cash delivery stock. 
 
f)  Other changes in the internal or external information on judging the credit quality changes. 
 
The Bank established Stage 1 and Stage 2 for debt instruments based on bonds ratings. Bonds 
rated above investment grades are classified as low credit risks. Credit risks are deemed to 
have  significantly  increased  if  credit  ratings  decreased  over  specific  level  after  initial 
recognition date.362CUBCN Bank 
 
CUBCN  Bank  assesses  the  movements  in  default risk  during  the expected  lifetime  of  various 
types  of  credit  assets  at  each  reporting  date  to  determine  if  the  credit  risk  has  increased

b)  Auditors have expressed significant doubt on the entity’s ability to continue as a goingconcern.c)  Other changes in the internal or external information on judging the credit qualitychanges.CUBC Bank 
 
CUBC Bank assesses if the credit risk of financial assets at each reporting date has increased 
significantly since initial recognition based on the following indicators: 
 
1)  Information on the overdue status of a contractWhen the contract payment is overdue for more than 15 days for short-term loans or more 
than 30 days for long-term loans at the reporting date, credit risk is deemed to have increased 
significantly since initial recognition.2)  Loan classification from National Bank of CambodiaA loan contract with special mention position at the reporting date would be classified as a 
loan with significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.3643)  Internal credit assessment indicatorsFor financial assets whose internal credit assessment indicators show a weaker credit 
quality compared to that upon initial recognition, credit risk is deemed to have increased 
significantly since initial recognition.Default and credit impairment of financial asset 
 
The Bank 
 
The Bank’s criteria for determining that a financial asset is in default are the same for evaluating 
credit impairment of financial assets. Where one or more of the following conditions are met, the 
Bank determines the financial assets to be subject to default and credit impairment. 
 
1)  Quantitative indicatora)  Changes in credit ratingWhen the credit rating at the reporting date fell into the default level, it is determined as 
credit impairment.b)  Information on the overdue status of a contractWhen the contract payment was overdue for more than 90 days at the reporting date, it is 
determined as credit impairment. Debt instruments that do not pay principal and interest 
according to issuance or transaction condition are determined to be credit-impaired.2)  Qualitative indicatorWhen the information observed at the reporting date indicates the following conditions, it is 
determined as credit impairment. 
 
a)  Bailout, reorganization, individual agreement due to debtor’s financial difficulties; 
 
b)  Lawsuit action has been taken; 
 
c)  Debt settlement, debt negotiation; 
 
d)  Other internal or external information on judging the deterioration in credit quality. 
 
The aforementioned definition of default and credit impairment applies to all financial 
assets held by the Bank, and is consistent with the definition applied on the significant 
financial assets for the purpose of internal credit risk management, and is also applied in the 
relevant impairment assessment model.365CUBCN Bank 
 
CUBCN  Bank’s  criteria  for  determining  that  a  financial  asset  is  in  default  are  the  same  for 
evaluating credit impairment of financial assets. Where one or more of the following conditions

a)  Any financial instruments are classified as substandard, doubtful or loss. 
 
b)  The lowest credit risk is classified as substandard, doubtful or loss. 
 
c)  Other internal rating is determined to have fallen into default level. 
 
The aforementioned definition of default and credit impairment applies to all financial assets 
held by CUBCN Bank, and is consistent with the definition applied on the relevant financial 
assets for the purpose of internal credit risk management, and is also applied in the relevant 
impairment assessment model.Indovina Bank 
 
Indovina Bank assesses the following indicators at each reporting date to determine if the 
financial assets are credit-impaired:

The Bank 
 
For the purpose of assessing the expected credit losses, the Bank classifies the credit assets into 
the following groups based on credit category, credit rating, risk characteristics, enterprise size, 
product category, and so on.Credit CategoryDefinitionEnterprise loanGrouped by risk characteristics, enterprise size and internalcredit ratingGrouped by product category and internal credit rating 
Grouped by product category and internal credit ratingConsumer loan 
Credit card 
 
When the credit risk of the financial instrument has not increased significantly after the initial 
recognition (Stage 1), the Bank will measure the allowance for losses at the 12-month expected 
credit losses. When the credit risk of the financial instrument has increased significantly (Stage 
2) or credit impairment has existed (Stage 3) after the initial recognition, the Bank will measure 
the allowance for losses at the lifetime expected credit losses.367For the measurement of the expected credit losses (“ECL”), the Bank calculates the 12-month 
ECL and lifetime ECL by multiplying three factors, i.e., probability of default (“PD”), loss given 
default (“LGD”) and exposure at default (“EAD”) of the borrower over the next 12 months and 
the lifetime. 
 
The  PD  and  LGD  applied in  the impairment  assessment  of the  credit  business of  the  Bank  is 
adjusted and calculated based on the internal information of each group of assets as well as the 
currently  observable  data  and  the  forward-looking  macroeconomic  information  (such  as 
economic growth rate, etc.). 
 
The  Bank  assesses  the  EAD  of  loan  at  the  reporting  date.  According  to  internal  and  external 
information, the Bank considers the portion of the loan commitment that is expected to be drawn 
within  12  months  after  the  reporting  date  and  for  the  lifetime,  to  determine  the  EAD  for 
calculating the expected credit losses. 
 
The Bank performs impairment assessment of debt instruments measured at FVTOCI and those 
measured at amortised cost in accordance with related requirements: 
 
1)  The EAD is measured at the amortised cost of a financial asset plus its interest receivable. 
 
2)  The PD is based on the information regularly published by Moody’s, and calculated on the 
basis  of  the  adjusted  historical  data  according  to  the  currently  observable  data  and  the 
forward-looking  macroeconomic  information  (e.g.,  gross  domestic  product  and  economic 
growth rate, etc.).3)  The  LGD  is  selected  according  to  the  type  of  debt  instrument  based  on  the  informationregularly published by Moody’s.CUBCN Bank 
 
For the purpose of assessing the expected credit losses, CUBCN Bank classifies the credit assets 
into the following groups based on product characteristics.Credit CategoryLoan activities, call loans to banks 
business, and off-balance sheet 
credit businessDefinitionGrouped by product category and internal/externalcredit ratingBilling businessGrouped by product category and internal/externalcredit ratingBond businessGrouped by product category and internal/externalcredit ratingDue from banks and reverseGrouped by product category and internal/externalrepurchasecredit rating1)  The expected credit losses of financial instruments are measured on a case-by-case basis asfollows:a)  For financial instruments in Stage 1, the allowance for losses is measured by the 12-monthexpected credit losses.368b)  For financial instruments in Stage 2, the allowance for losses is measured by the lifetimeexpected credit losses.c)For financial instruments in Stage 3, if the single account loan balance exceeds a certain 
amount, the discounted cash flow method can be used for individual assessment; if not 
using individual assessment, the allowance for losses is measured by the lifetime expected 
credit losses, and the PD is 100%.2)  The expected credit loss parameters of financial instruments are calculated according to thefollowing principles respectively:a)  The PD is based on the information regularly published by Moody’s, and calculated on 
the basis of the adjusted historical data according to the currently observable data and the 
forward-looking macroeconomic information.b)  The  LGD  is  based  on  LGD  regulated  in  the  Capital  of  Commercial  Banks  (for  TrialImplementation) published by China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.c)  The  EAD  is  measured  at  current  exposure  method.  Besides,  off-balance  sheet  credit 
business  also  converts  using  credit  conversion  factor  regulated  in  the  Capital  of 
Commercial  Banks  (for  Trial  Implementation)  published  by  China  Banking  and 
Insurance Regulatory Commission.Indovina Bank 
 
For the purpose of assessing the expected credit losses, Indovina Bank classifies the credit assets 
into the following groups based on credit category, credit rating, risk characteristics, enterprise 
size, product category, counterparty type, and so on.CategoryLoan portfolio 
Bond portfolio1)  Loan portfolioDescriptionGrouped by counterparty type and enterprise size 
Grouped by product category, external credit rating andpayment ranksThe measurement of expected credit loss of Indovina Bank’s loan portfolio is based on its 
internal  product  category,  counterparty  type  and  enterprise  size,  and  is  estimated  by  three 
main parameters, including probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. 
The  probabilities  of  default  and  loss  given  default  were  built  by  the  Bank’s  historical 
delinquent information and recovery data and calibrated by selected macroeconomic factors 
for  forward-looking  adjustment.  The  estimated  amounts  of  exposure  at  default  were 
calculated by the amortised cost and interest receivable. At each financial reporting date, if 
the above criteria for a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are not met, 
the  loss  allowance  shall  be  measured  on  the  basis  of  the  12-month  expected  credit  loss 
method. If financial assets meet the foregoing conditions of significant increases in credit risk 
or  credit  deterioration  since  initial  recognition,  the  loss  allowance  shall  be  estimated 
according to the respective methods on the basis of lifetime expected credit losses.3692)  Bond portfolioThe measurement of expected credit loss of Indovina Bank’s bond portfolio is based on its 
product category, issuer’s credit rating and payment ranks. The probabilities of default and 
loss  given  default  were  built  by  the  delinquent  information  and  calibrated  by  selected 
macroeconomic factors for forward-looking adjustment. At each financial reporting date, if 
the above criteria for a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are not met, 
the  loss  allowance  shall  be  measured  on  the  basis  of  the  12-month  expected  credit  loss 
method. If financial assets meet the foregoing conditions of significant increases in credit risk 
or  credit  deterioration  since  initial  recognition,  the  loss  allowance  shall  be  estimated 
according to the respective methods on the basis of lifetime expected credit losses.CUBC Bank 
 
CUBC Bank has grouped its exposures on the basis of shared credit risk characteristic, including 
product category and counterparty types as follows:CategoryDescriptionLoanGrouped by product characteristics, industry andcounterparty typeGrouped by product characteristicsCredit Card 
 
The measurement of expected credit loss of CUBC Bank’s loan portfolio is based on its credit 
category,  counterparty  type  and  product  category.  The  probabilities  of  default  and  loss  given 
default were built by the internal and external historical delinquent information, LGD supervised 
under Basel II and calibrated by selected macroeconomic factors for forward-looking adjustment. 
The estimated amounts of exposure at default were calculated by the amortised cost and interest 
receivable. At each financial reporting date, if the above criteria for a significant increase in credit 
risk since initial recognition are not met, the loss allowance shall be measured on the basis of the 
12-month  expected  credit  loss  method.  If  financial  assets  meet  the  foregoing  conditions  of 
significant  increases  in  credit  risk  or  credit  deterioration  since  initial  recognition,  the  loss 
allowance shall be estimated according to the respective methods on the basis of lifetime expected 
credit losses. 
 
Write-off policy 
 
The Company write-off the financial assets partially or entirely to the extent of the amount which 
cannot be reasonably expected to be recovered. 
 
The indicators for reasonably expected to be unrecoverable include: 
 
1)  The recourse procedure has ceased. 
 
2)  The debtor’s assets or income are evaluated to be insufficient to repay outstanding payments. 
 
Financial  asset  which  has  been  written-off  can  do  the  recovery  of  debt  and  institute  legal 
proceedings continuously under related policies.370Consideration of forward-looking information 
 
The Bank 
 
The Bank uses historical data to analyze and identify the significant economic factors that affect 
the credit risks and expected credit losses of each group of assets, and uses the regression model 
to estimate the impairment parameter after the prospective adjustment. The significant 
economic factors and their impact on PD differ depending on the type of financial instruments. 
 
The significant economic factors identified by the Bank in 2021 are as follows:Credit CategoryProbability of Default (PD)Enterprise loanProportion of revenue less expenditures from governmentConsumer loanCredit Cardto GDP %Proportion of expenditures from government to GDP % 
Inflation index % 
Unemployment rate % 
Price Index

Proportion of revenue from government to GDP (%)CUBCN Bank 
 
CUBCN Bank uses historical data and rate of non-performing industry loans issued by the 
authorities to analyze and identify the significant economic factors that affect the credit risks 
and expected credit losses of each group of assets, and uses the regression model to estimate the 
impairment parameter after the prospective adjustment, in order to obtain an unbiased estimate 
of expected credit losses. 
 
The relevant economic factors identified by CUBCN Bank in 2021 include but are not limited 
to gross domestic product (GDP) published by the China Statistics Bureau, China Customs and 
other government authorities, consumer price index (CPI), import price index, and government 
expenditure data, etc. 
 
Indovina Bank 
 
Based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of historical data, Indovina Bank identifies 
the local and global economic factors that affect the credit risks and expected credit losses of 
each group of assets, and uses the regression models, interpolation adjustment, and historical 
scenario analysis to estimate the impairment parameter after the prospective adjustment. The 
selected economic factors and their effects on PDs varied from different types of portfolios.371The macroeconomic factors selected by Indovina Bank for the forward-looking adjustments in

Credit risk management policy 
 
The category of credit asset and the grade of credit quality are described as follows: 
 
1)  Category of credit assetThe credit risk of the Bank is classified into five categories. Normal credit assets are classified 
as “Category One.” The remaining unsound credit assets are evaluated based on the status of 
the  loan  collateral  and  the  length  of  time  the  asset  is  overdue.  Assets  that  require  special 
mention  are  classified  as  “Category  Two,”  assets  that  are  substandard  are  classified  as 
“Category Three,” assets that are doubtful are classified as “Category Four,” and assets for 
which there is loss are classified as “Category Five”. For managing the default credits, the 
Bank established the regulations governing the procedures to deal with non-performing loans, 
non-accrual loans and bad debts.3722)  Grade of credit qualityThe Bank sets the grade of credit quality based on the characteristics and scale of business 
(such as establishing the internal rating model of credit risk, setting the credit rating table or 
relevant rules to classify) to proceed with risk management.   
 
In  order  to  measure  the  credit  risk  of  the  clients,  the  Bank  develops  the  rating  model  of 
business credit by employing statistical methods and the professional judgment of the experts 
as well as considering the clients’ relevant information. The model is reviewed periodically 
to verify if the calculated results conform to the reality and make necessary revision to the 
parameters to optimize the results. 
 
With  respect to  consumer  credit assets such as  mortgages,  credit cards,  and  small-amount 
credit loans, the Bank also evaluates default risk of clients by using the credit rating scores 
developed by the Bank and the external due diligence services. 
 
The credit quality of the Bank’s corporate borrowers is classified as excellent, good, average, 
or bad. 
 
To  ensure  the  reasonableness  of the estimated  values  of  the credit  rating  system’s  design, 
process, and relevant risk factors, the Bank executes the relevant verification and tests the 
model according to the actual default every year so that the calculated results will be close to 
actual default. 
 
The Bank evaluates the counterparties’ credit quality before transactions are made and refers 
to the domestic and foreign credit rating agencies, when rendering different lines of credit 
based on the credit quality.3)  Hedge of credit risk and easing policya)  CollateralThe Bank adopts a series of policies to lower the credit risk, and one of the frequently-
used methods is requesting borrowers to provide collateral. To ensure the creditor’s rights, 
the Bank sets the scope of collateral and the procedures for appraising, managing, and 
disposing  of  the  collateral.  In  addition,  a  credit  contract  stipulates  the  bases  for  credit 
claims, preservation of collateral, and offset provisions when a credit loss event occurs; 
the Bank may reduce the limit, cut down the payback period, or deem all debts as due. 
Also, the Bank may use the deposits that the borrowers saved in the Bank to offset the 
liabilities to lower the credit risk. 
 
Other  non-credit  business  collateral  depends  on  the  characteristics  of  the  financial 
instruments.  Only  asset-backed  securities  and  other  similar  financial  instruments  are 
secured by an asset pool of financial instruments.b)  Limit of credit risk and control of credit risk concentrationTo avoid the excessive risk concentration, the Bank limits the credit amounts of single 
counterparties and groups; the Bank also sets the investment guide and regulation of risk 
control of equity investment to restrict the investment limits of single person (company) 
or  related  company  (group).  Furthermore,  the  Bank  establishes  relevant  regulations  to 
control  the  concentration  risk  of  assets,  and  sets  the  credit  limits  by  industry,  group, 
country, and stock types to monitor the credit concentration risk.373c)  Net settlement agreementThe Bank usually settles by the gross balance, but signs contract with some counterparties 
to settle by net balance. If a default happens, the Bank will terminate all transactions with 
the counterparty and settle by net balance in order to lower the credit risk.4)  Maximum exposures to credit riskWithout  taking  into  account  the  collateral  or  other  credit  enhancement  instruments,  the 
maximum  credit  risk  exposures  of  on-balance-sheet  financial  assets  equal  their  carrying 
amounts. The maximum credit risk exposures of off-balance-sheet items (without considering 
the collateral or other credit enhancement instruments) are as follows:

To reduce  the  risk  from  any  businesses,  the  Bank  conducts an  overall  assessment  and 
takes  appropriate  risk  reduction  measures  before  undertaking  the  business,  such  as 
obtaining  collateral  and  guarantors.  For  obtaining  of  collateral,  the  Bank  has  set 
Guidelines Governing Collateral to ensure that collateral meets the specific criteria and 
has the effect of reducing the business risk. 
 
The  management  deems  the  Company  is  able  to  control  and  minimize  the  credit  risk 
exposures in off-balance-sheet items as the Company uses stricter rating procedures when 
extending credits and conducts reviews regularly.

but engaging in similar business activities and sharing similar economic characteristics, and 
vulnerable to the same economic impacts or other changes, the credit concentration risk is 
apparent. 
 
Credit concentration risk of the Company derives from the assets, liabilities and off-
balance-sheet items, and arises from performing obligations or engaging in transactions of 
cross-line portfolio with risk exposures including credit extension, due from and call loans 
to other banks, securities investment, receivables and derivatives. The Company does not 
significantly concentrate on a single client or counterparty, and the transaction amount with 
a single client or counterparty relative to the Company’s total bills discounts and loans, 
including overdue loans, guarantees, bills purchased, and acceptances receivable is not 
significant. Credit concentration risk of the Company according to industry and geographic 
region is listed below:376Industry TypeManufacturing

       100.00b.  Liquidity risk1)  Source and definition of liquidity riskLiquidity risk means the possible losses arising from the failure of the Bank to obtain funds 
at a reasonable price within a reasonable time to cover the increase in assets or repay matured 
liabilities.2)  Liquidity risk management strategy and principlesThe  principle  of  liquidity  risk  management  strategy  of  the  Company  is  to  stabilize  the 
liquidity of funds. The first priority of the source of funds is diversification and stability, and 
the Company adopts the conservative principle to estimate the funds. The use of funds should 
take into account both safety and profitability, and pay attention to diversifying liquidity risks. 
The Company has set up an Asset and Liability Management Committee, which is responsible 
for planning and monitoring liquidity risk management strategy and controlling liquidity risk 
with risk limits from different measuring dimensions and early warning indicators. When the 
liquidity has or expects significant changes, relevant authorities and responsible units jointly 
analyze  the  reasons  and  discuss  solutions  to  deal  with  the  impact  of  emergent  events  on 
liquidity risk. If necessary, the Asset and Liability Management Committee may be convened 
to discuss solutions.3773)  Financial  assets  held  to  manage  liquidity  risk  and  maturity  analysis  of  non-derivativefinancial liabilities of the Bank 
 
a)  Financial assets held to manage liquidity riskThe  Company  holds  highly  marketable  and  diverse  financial  assets  to  meet  payment 
obligations; assets that can be easily liquidated in the event of an unforeseen interruption 
of  cash  flow. The financial  assets  held to  manage  liquidity  risk  include  cash  and  cash 
equivalents, due from the Central Bank and call loans to other banks, financial assets at 
FVTPL, financial assets at FVTOCI, investments in debt instruments at amortised cost, 
discounts and loans, and securities purchased under resell agreements.b)  Maturity analysis of non-derivative financial liabilities of the BankThe  table  below  shows  the  analysis  of  the  cash  outflow  of  non-derivative  financial

interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity securities. 
 
The Bank organized market risk management department and the committee of assets and 
liabilities management. The department and the committee periodically examine the Bank’s 
structure of assets and liabilities; plan the pricing principle of deposit and loan and 
financing, and uses medium- and long-term funding schemes. While executing the market 
risk management, the market risk management department periodically provides the related 
information of management and reports to the authorized managers of the Bank for the 
management system, such as evaluating position, risk limit management, calculation of 
profit and loss, pricing model and risk analysis, in order to control the overall market risk.2)  Market risk management strategy and processMarket risk management process 
 
a)  Identification and measurementThe  operations  department  and  risk  management  department  of  the  Bank  identify  the 
market risk factors of risk exposure position, and measure the market risk. Market risk 
factors are the components that could have an impact on value of financial instrument, 
such  as  interest  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates,  equity  securities  price,  etc.,  including 
position, gain and loss, stress testing, sensitivity (DV01, Delta, Vega, Gamma) and Value 
at  Risk  (VaR)  etc.,  are  used  to  measure  the  extent  of  investment  portfolio  loss  that  is 
influenced by interest risk, foreign exchange risk and price of equity securities.b)  Monitoring and reportingThe  risk  management  department  periodically  reports  the  execution  of  market  risk 
management target, position and gain/loss control, sensitivity analysis, stress testing, and 
VaR of equity securities to the board of directors, and helps the board of directors to fully 
understand  the  status  of  market  risk  management.  The  Bank  also  establishes  a  clear 
reporting process. Each transaction has the requirements about limitation and stop-loss 
points.  If  the  transaction  reaches  its  stop-loss  limitation,  stop-loss  process  will  be 
implemented  immediately. If  the  stop-loss process  is not implemented,  the  transaction 
department  should  document  the  reason  for  not  implementing  stop-loss  process  and 
response plan. Furthermore, the department shall report to the executive management for 
approval and reports to the board of directors regularly.3823)  Risk management policy of the trading bookThe trading book is the portfolio of financial instruments and physical investments for the 
purpose of trading or the hedge on the trading book. Portfolio is held for trading for the 
purpose of earning profit from the bid-ask spread. Any positions aside from the above 
trading book will be in the banking book. 
 
a)  StrategyIn  order  to  control  market  risk  effectively  and  ensure  flexibility  in  operating  the 
transaction strategy, the Bank carries out various assessment and control procedures. The 
portfolio  of  trading  book  has  the  risk  limit  for  each  investment  portfolio  which  is  set 
according to the transaction strategy, category of investment and the annual profit target.b)  Policy and procedureThe Bank sets the “Rules of Market Risk Management” as the important regulation that 
should be complied with when holding trading portfolio.c)  Valuation policyIf the financial instruments of trading book have market values, they should be evaluated 
at  least  once  each  day  based  on  information  from  independent  and  easily  accessible 
sources.  If  the  financial  instruments  are  evaluated  by  a  model,  a  mathematical  model 
should  be  used prudently,  and  the  assumptions  and  parameters  of  the  valuation model 
should be regularly reviewed and examined.d)  Method of measurementi.  The assumptions and calculation method are described in the VaR section. 
 
ii.  The Bank executes the stress testing monthly based on the following scenarios: The 
fluctuation  of  interest  rate  at  100bp,  equity  securities  price  at  15%  and  foreign 
exchange rate at 3%, and reports to the risk management committee regularly.4)  Interest risk management of trading booka)  Definition of interest riskInterest risk is the risk that the trading portfolios suffer losses or the fair value changes 
due  to  fluctuations  in  interest  rates.  The  main  instruments  include  the  securities  and 
derivatives that are related to interest rates.383b)  Interest risk management procedure of trading bookThe Bank prudently chooses its investment target by studying the credibility and financial 
position of the securities issuers, and the sovereign risk and the trend of interest rates of 
the country. According to the operating strategy and the circumstances of the market, the 
Bank sets the transaction limit and stop-loss limit (including the limits of dealing room, 
traders,  and  investment,  etc.)  of  the  trading  book  that  are  reported  to  the  executive 
management or the board of directors for approval.c)  Method of measurementi.  The assumptions and calculation method are described in the VaR section. 
ii.  The  Bank  measures  the  investment  portfolio’s  interest  risk  exposure  with  DV01monthly.5)  Interest risk management of banking bookThe interest risk of banking book means that adverse changes in interest rates affect the value 
and  cash  flow  of  the  banking  book  position,  resulting  in  current  or  potential  risks  to  the 
Bank’s capital and earnings. 
 
a)  StrategyBased on the principle of prudent operation and conservation, the first priority is on the 
diversification and stability of assets and liabilities, and then on safety and profitability, 
and the Company should pay attention to risk diversification.b)  Management procedureThe  Company  has  established  interest  risk  indicators  of  banking  book  to  control  the 
banking book interest risk. If the indicators are abnormal, the possible offset treatment 
should be evaluated and reported to the Asset and Liability Management Committee to 
review the asset and liability structure and pricing principles, so as to reduce or control 
the adverse impact on earnings or net worth.c)  Method of measurementMeasurement  methods  of  banking  book  interest  risk  include  repricing  gap  analysis, 
earnings viewpoint (ΔNII) analysis, and economic value viewpoint (ΔEVE) analysis. The 
Company adopts appropriate measurement methods to manage banking book interest risk 
in accordance with local regulatory requirements or internal management needs.3846)  Foreign exchange risk managementa)  Definition of foreign exchange riskForeign  exchange  risk  is  the  gain/loss  caused  by  two  currencies  exchange  at  different 
times. The Bank’s foreign exchange risk arises from the derivative instruments, such as 
spot exchange, forward exchange and foreign exchange option, etc. The Bank’s foreign 
exchange transactions are implemented daily to offset clients’ positions. Thus, the Bank 
is not exposed to significant foreign exchange risk.b)  Policy, procedure and measurement method of foreign exchange risk managementIn order to control foreign exchange risk, the Bank sets the limits of transaction and stop-
loss limits for the dealing room and traders. Meanwhile, the Bank also sets the maximum 
annual loss limit to control the loss within the tolerable extent. Foreign exchange risk is 
controlled based on VaR. The assumption and calculation of VaR are described in the 
VaR section. 
 
For  foreign  exchange  risk,  the  Bank  sets  the  scenario  at  3%  fluctuation  of  foreign 
exchange rates of major currencies to execute the stress testing quarterly, and reports to 
the risk management committee.c)  The significant portfolios of foreign currency financial assets and liabilities are as follows:Financial assets

11,962As the Company has a large variety of foreign currencies, it is not practicable to disclose 
foreign  currency  exchange  gain  or  loss  based  on  each  foreign  currency’s  exposure  to 
major  impact.  The  foreign  currency  exchange  gains  were  $1,231,018  thousand  and 
$1,237,639 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.7)  Risk management of equity securities pricea)  Definition of risk of equity securities priceThe market risk of equity securities held by the Bank includes the individual risk from 
the fluctuation of individual equity securities’ market price and general market risk from 
the fluctuation of the overall price trend.b)  Purpose of risk management of equity securities priceThe purpose is to avoid the massive fluctuation of equity securities price that worsens the 
Bank’s  financial  situation  or  earnings;  to  raise  the  operating  efficiency  of  capital  and 
strengthen the business operation.c)  Procedure of risk management of equity securities priceThe Bank sets investment limits on industries, using the β value to measure the investment 
portfolio affected by the systemic risk monthly. The stop-loss point must be authorized 
by  the  board  of  directors,  and  the  equity  investment  should  be  authorized  by  the 
executives if the stop-loss point is reached but the investment is not going to be disposed 
of.d)  Measurement methodThe risk of equity securities price in trading book is mainly controlled by VaR.The Bank’s risk of equity securities prices from its non-trading portfolio is controlled through 
stress testing of business scale under appropriate scenarios and the Bank reports the results 
to the risk management committee. 
 
The Bank adopts many methods to manage its market risk. Value-at-risk (VaR) is one of the 
methods. VaR is a statistical measure that assesses potential losses that might be caused by 
changes in risk factors over a specified period of time and at a specific level of statistical386confidence. The Bank applies historical simulation with a statistical confidence of 99% to 
extrapolate the VaR of one-year fluctuations. The following form indicates the VaR which is 
the estimation of potential amount of loss within one day. The statistical confidence of 99% 
represents  the  possible  fluctuations  that  would  be  included  in  assumed  adverse  market 
changes. Based on the assumption, the VaR may exceed the amounts listed in 1 of 100 days 
due to the price changes in the market. The overall VaR in the market may be less than the 
aggregate VaR of individual market risk factors.Factors of Market Risk

purposes.  The  objectives  in  using  derivative  instruments  are  to  meet  customers’  needs,  to 
manage the Bank’s exposure to risks and to generate revenues through trading activities. The 
Bank  trades  derivative  instruments  on  behalf  of  customers  and  for  its  own  positions.  The 
Bank  transacts  derivative  contracts  with  its  clients  to  meet  their  demands  and  also  takes 
proprietary positions for its own accounts within the allowed market risk.3878)  Stress testingThe stress testing is used to measure the maximum loss of risk asset portfolio under the 
worst-case scenario. The Bank takes into consideration various types of risk factors during

118,19010) Effect of interest rate benchmark reformThe Bank is exposed to USD LIBOR which is subject to interest rate benchmark reform. The 
exposures  arise  on  derivatives  and  non-derivative  financial  assets  and  liabilities.  SOFR 
(Secured  Overnight  Financing  Rate)  is  expected  to  replace  USD  LIBOR.  There  are  key 
differences  between  USD  LIBOR  and  SOFR.  USD  LIBOR  is  “forward  looking”,  which 
implies market expectation over future interest rates, and includes a credit spread over the 
risk-free  rate.  SOFR  is  currently  a  “backward-looking”  rate,  based  on  interest  rates  from 
actual  transactions,  and  excludes  a  credit  spread.  Therefore,  when  existing  contracts  and 
agreements that reference USD LIBOR transfer to SOFR, adjustments for these differences 
might  need  to  be  applied to  SOFR  to  enable the two  benchmark  rates  to  be  economically 
equivalent. 
 
The  Bank  established  a  USD  LIBOR  transition  project  plan  to  handle  risk  management 
policies changes, internal processes adjustments, IT systems updates and valuation models 
adjustments, as well as to manage any related tax and accounting issues in accordance with 
interest rate benchmark reform. As of December 31, 2021, changes required to IT systems 
and internal processes have been identified and have been partially implemented.389Risks arising from the transition relate principally to the potential impact of interest rate basis 
risk.  If  the  bilateral  negotiations  with  the  Bank’s  counterparties  are  not  successfully 
concluded before the cessation of USD LIBOR, the case will bring significant uncertainties 
to the future interest rate basis applied to financial instruments, and give rise to additional 
interest rate risk that was not anticipated when the contracts were entered into. If a hedged 
financial instrument and the related hedging derivative instruments are transited to alternative 
benchmark rates at different times, it could result in hedge ineffectiveness.

counterparty collateral for repurchase agreements or  equity securities lent as part of securities 
lending agreement. The nature of these transactions are secured loans, and reflects the liability 
where the Company is obligated to repurchase the transferred financial assets according to a fixed

sell or pledge such transferred financial assets during the effective period. However, the Company 
is still exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk, hence they are not derecognized.391The following table is an analysis of financial assets and financial liabilities that have not been

Calculating the Eligible Capital and Risk-Weighted Assets of Banks.”Note 2:  Formulas used were as follows:1)  Eligible capital = Common equity + Other Tier 1 capital + Tier 2 capital. 
 
2)  Risk-weighted assets = Risk-weighted asset for credit risk + Capital requirementsfor operational risk and market risk x 12.5.3)  Capital adequacy ratio = Eligible capital ÷ Risk-weighted assets.3944)  Ratio of the common equity to risk-weighted assets = Common equity ÷ Risk-weighted assets.5)  Ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets = (Common equity + Other Tier 1capital) ÷ Risk-weighted assets.6)  Leverage ratio = Tier 1 capital ÷ Exposure measurement.The Banking Law and related regulations require the Bank to maintain its unconsolidated and 
consolidated CARs at a minimum of 10.5%, the Tier 1 Capital Ratio at a minimum of 8.5% and 
the Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio at a minimum of 7%. In addition, if the Bank’s CAR falls below 
the minimum requirement, the authorities may impose certain restrictions on the amount of cash 
dividends  that  the  Bank  can  declare  or,  in  certain  conditions,  totally  prohibit  the  Bank  from 
declaring cash dividends.52.  UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIESThe Company does not provide financial support or other support to the unconsolidated structured

The Board of Directors and Stockholder 
Cathay United Bank Co., Ltd. 
 
Opinion 
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Cathay United Bank Co., Ltd. (the 
“Bank”), which comprise the balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the statements of 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the notes to 
the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies (collectively 
referred to as the “financial statements”). 
 
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of the Bank as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, its financial performance, and its 
cash flows for the years then ended, in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation 
of Financial Reports by Public Banks and Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial 
Reports by Securities Firms. 
 
Basis for Opinion 
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the Regulations Governing Auditing and Attestation of 
Financial Statements by Certified Public Accountants and auditing standards generally accepted in 
the Republic of China. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Bank in accordance with The Norm of Professional Ethics for Certified Public 
Accountant of the Republic of China, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
 
Key Audit Matters 
 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2021. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.414The key audit matters of the Bank’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 are 
stated as follows: 
 
Impairment Assessment of Loans 
 
The domestic loans of the Bank which amounted to $1,674,216,558 thousand were considered 
material to the financial statements as a whole. As the assessment of impairment of loans involves 
accounting estimates and management’s significant judgment, and as the amount of impairment 
assessed on loans under the relevant regulations issued by the authorities is substantially larger than 
that assessed under IFRS 9, hence, we determined the impairment of the loans assessed under the 
relevant regulations prescribed by the authorities as a key audit matter. 
 
The Bank’s management regularly assesses its loans for impairment. Recognition of impairment 
loss on loans is based on compliance with regulations issued by the authorities regarding the 
classification of credit assets and provision of impairment loss. For the accounting policies and 
relevant information on the impairment assessment of loans, refer to Notes 4, 5 and 14. 
 
The main audit procedures we performed in response to the key audit matter described above are as 
follows: 
 
1.  We understood and tested the internal controls of impairment assessment of loans. 
 
2.  We tested the classification of the credit assets into their respective categories out of the totalfive categories to see if it complies with the relevant regulations issued by the authorities.3.  We performed the test on selected samples to ensure the appropriateness of impairment by thelength of the overdue period and the value of the collateral of each respective loan.4.  We calculated the provision of impairment loss by classifying the credit assets into theirrespective category to see if it complies with the relevant regulations issued by the authorities.Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the FinancialStatementsManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Public Banks 
and Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Firms, and for such 
internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
Those charged with governance, including the supervisors, are responsible for overseeing the 
Bank’s financial reporting process.415Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the 
Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
 
As part of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of 
China, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also: 
 
1.Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.2.  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design auditprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.3.  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accountingestimates and related disclosures made by management.4.  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis ofaccounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue 
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.5.  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, includingthe disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.6.  Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities 
or business activities within the Bank to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the group audit. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies 
in internal control that we identify during our audit.416From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 
31, 2021 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report 
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication. 
 
The engagement partners on the audits resulting in this independent auditors’ report are Cheng-
Hung Kuo and Shiuh-Ran Cheng.
