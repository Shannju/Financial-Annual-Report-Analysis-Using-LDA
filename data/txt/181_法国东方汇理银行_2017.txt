both the first and second quarter have been restated in specific items, contrary to the treatment applied in bothpublications  made  previously.  Underlying  net income  Group  share  for  those  two  quarters  has  been  adjustedaccordingly.Since 26 September 2017, Banque Saudi Fransi (BSF) has been excluded from the scope of consolidation ofCrédit Agricole Group further to the disposal of a majority of the holding (16.2% out of the 31.1% held prior todisposal). This subsidiary was consolidated using the equity method.

Crédit Agricole S.A.  entities  and  the  Crédit Agricole  Regional Banks,  which  own  56.6%  of  Crédit Agricole S.A.  Please  see 
p. 18  (Crédit Agricole S.A.)  and  p. 19  (Crédit Agricole Group)  of  this  press  release  for  details  of  specific  items,  which  are 
restated in the various indicators to calculate underlying results. A reconciliation between the stated income statement and

Crédit Agricole S.A.Results for the fourth quarter and full year 20172/28Crédit Agricole GroupIn 2017, Crédit Agricole Group’s net income Group share was 6.5 billion euros, up +35.5% on 2016. 2017performance was  penalised  in  the fourth  quarter  by a tax surcharge (net  impact  of  (cid:173)671 million euros,recorded as a specific item). Adjusting for this expense and for other specific items in 2017, underlying 
net income Group share amounted to 7.1 billion euros, an increase of +8.9% from 2016. This includes sixmonths of Pioneer, but also the consolidation losses on Eurazeo and BSF following their disposal (partialin  the  case  of  BSF)  and  deconsolidation.  Excluding  these  scope  effects,  these  results  reflect  strong 
business momentum in the Group’s various components – retail banks, specialised businesses and theLarge  customers  business  line  –  coupled  with  tight  cost  control  enabling  the  Group  to  invest  in  newbusiness  activities.  The  underlying  cost/income  ratio  stood  at  63.4%.  2017  marks  an  important  step 
toward  achieving  the  objectives  of  the  Strategic  Ambition  2020  medium-term  plan  (MTP):  revenuesynergies  reached  8.2 billion euros  (increase  of  +5%)  and  the  Group  launched  and  implementedinnovations to improve its customers’ digital experience as well as its range of products and services. 
In  addition  to  the  scope  changes  already  mentioned,  the  fourth  quarter  also  saw  the  finalisation  ofexternal growth operations aimed at strengthening the business lines in a profitable way: the three Italianbanks, Natixis’ 15% residual stake in CACEIS and the private banking business of CM-CIC in Asia; the 
acquisition  of  Banca  Leonardo  is  expected  to  be finalised  in  the first  half  of  2018.  These acquisitionswere  self-financed,  and  the  financial  position  remains  very  strong:  at  end-December,  the  fully-loadedCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.9%, among the best in the sector and more than 5 percentage pointsabove the regulatory minimum.In line with the "Strategic Ambition 2020" medium-term plan (MTP), the Group’s stable, diversified and profitablebusiness  model  drives  healthy  organic  growth in all  its  business  lines,  largely  through  synergies  between  thespecialised  business  lines  and  the  retail  networks,  and  ensures  a  high  level  of  operating  efficiency  whilegenerating capacity to invest in business development.The fourth quarter saw several major achievements under the “Strategic Ambition 2020” plan:-  On 21 December, Cariparma finalised the acquisition of 95% of the capital of  three savings banks in 
Italy  (Cassa  di  Rispamio (CR)  di  Cesena,  CR  Rimini  and  CR  San  Miniato),  which operate  in  regionsbordering the Group’s core territories in Italy. This transaction increased the Group’s distribution capacityin Italy by about 20% (220 branches);-  Crédit Agricole S.A. acquired Natixis’ 15% residual stake in CACEIS, Crédit Agricole's asset servicingsubsidiary. This operation gives the Group full control of a rapidly-growing business line, helping improveits profitability;It is important to underscore that these operations only add to the long list of accomplishments made in 2017toward meeting the objectives of the Strategic Ambition 2020 plan.-  The  acquisition  of  Pioneer  Investments,  finalised  on  3  July,  made  Amundi-Pioneer  the  ninth  largestasset manager in the world and the largest in Europe, with top ranking positions in France, Italy, Austriaand Germany;-  On  31  October,  Indosuez  Wealth  Management  signed  an  agreement  to  acquire  67.67%  of  Banca 
Leonardo; this company provides wealth management services and has 5 billion euros in assets undermanagement.-Insourcing by Crédit Agricole Assurances of new creditor insurance business for the Regional Banksbegan in September and will be completed in H1 2018; CNP will continue to co-insure 50% of in-forcebusiness  until  extinction.  The  Insurance  business  line  also  continued  to  roll  out  its  group  insuranceoffering;Results for the fourth quarter and full year 20173/28-  Refocusing on core businesses continued with the disposal of 16.2% of the Group’s 31.1% stake inBanque  Saudi  Fransi  (BSF),  finalised  on  26  September,  and  of  the  entire  15.4%  stake  in  Eurazeo, 
finalised on 6 June. These operations reduced the Group's dependence on the contributions of equity-accounted entities, advantageously replaced by acquisitions of majority-controlled activities in line withthe Group's core business focus;-  There  was  further  growth  in  cross  selling,  with  new  instances  of  collaboration  among  the  Group'sentities  in  the  areas  of  consumer  finance,  leasing,  group  insurance,  home  protection  and  security,employee savings and group pensions, private equity funds, etc.;-  According to D-Rating6, Crédit Agricole is ahead of all  the other banking networks and the majority  of 
online-only banks when it comes to “digital performance”, especially in digital fingerprint identificationand processing capacity. This is evidenced by increased usage and reflected in the share of transactions 
that  are  carried out  online  or  in fully  paperless  format:  15%  in the  case of  the  Regional  Banks’  homeloans business, 27% in property and casualty insurance and at least 20% of LCL's insurance and savingssales;-  Numerous innovations have already been successfully launched, with more on the way: a new accountaccess  solution  with  EKO  by  the  Regional  Banks,  a  100%  digital  factoring  solution  by  CA  Leasing  &Factoring  (Cash  in  Time),  a  tool  that  helps  farmers  take  out  property  and  casualty  insurance  by  CA 
Assurances  (GEOPLAN),  a bank  card  rewards  programme  by  LCL  (Avantages+,  615,000 customers, 
+120% in one year), a new version of Cariparma's mobile app (Conto Adesso) and more;-  The Group also expanded its incubation initiatives (including Villages by CA), launched new innovationinvestment funds (total allocation of 100 million euros) and developed new in-house innovation labs (in-house start-up studio “La Fabrique by CA” and CA [CACD2], a “digital hive”);-  Finally, projects were undertaken to improve the Group's operational efficiency, including “Save”(purchasing  optimisation,  targeted  savings  of  210 million euros),  “Transforming  Together”  (savingsacrossthe  supportfunctions  of  Crédit Agricole S.A.  (corporate  entity),targeted  savings  of300 million euros) and the creation of a joint IT production entity for all of Crédit Agricole Group (targetedsavings of 185 million euros over five years).In the fourth quarter 2017, Credit Agricole Group's stated net income Group share came to 922 million eurosversus 671 million euros in the fourth quarter 2016.This  result  includes  a  net  negative  impact  of  -671 million euros  from  a  tax  surcharge.  This  net  impact  isattributable to four elements recorded as specific items:-  The exceptional contribution and additional contribution corporate tax surcharges introduced inFrance in late 2017 and applied to the largest companies had the effect of increasing Crédit AgricoleGroup's corporate tax rate by 10 percentage points, with a financial impact of -343 million euros;-In addition, Crédit Agricole CIB may be obliged to reallocate to clients the corporate tax savings madeas part of the tax consolidation of Crédit Agricole Group owing to deficits on lease financing vehicles in 
client investments; the impact of the exceptional corporate tax increase for 2017 on this reallocation is 
to 
estimatedto  be  39.9 million euros,  bringingthe  “surcharge”thetotalimpact  of(cid:173)383 million euros;-  As a reminder, these contributions are meant to mitigate the budgetary consequences of the refund ofFrance's 3% tax on dividend distributions, which companies had been paying since 2012 and which wasruled  unconstitutional  in  October  2017.  The  Group  is  thus  eligible  for  a  refund  of  +90 million euros 
(+79 million euros  on  net income  Group  share)  for  dividends  for  Crédit  Agricole  S.A.,  Amundi  andCACEIS distributed between 2012 and 2017;6 Source Les Echos article published on 25/01/18 on D-rating study regarding digital performance of retail banksResults for the fourth quarter and full year 20174/28-  Finally, the planned corporate tax cuts in legislation passed in France7 and the United States entail the 
revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with their provisional maturity dates. 
This revaluation had a negative impact of -407 million euros on net income Group share. It should benoted that this rate cut will have a favourable effect on future annual tax expenses paid by the Group, atleast in France.The balance of these four items is negative, amounting to a -671-million-euro impact on net income Group share.Given their non-recurring nature, all these impacts were recorded as specific items in order to better reflect theGroup's underlying profitability.This quarter, specific items8 had a negative impact of -770 million euros on stated net income Group share, a 
result largely attributable to the aforementioned tax impacts. Other items were the penalty associated with theCheck  Image  Exchange  (-98 million euros),  integration  costs  for  Pioneer  and  the  three  Italian  banks 
((cid:173)57 million euros), 
the  Polish  entities(-62 million euros),  goodwillissuer  spreadimpairment  on((cid:173)222 million euros), as well as badwill on the three Italian banks (+353 million euros) and other less significantitems (-13 million euros).As  a  reminder,  in  the  fourth  quarter  of 2016,  specific  items  had  a  negative  impact  of  -1,159 billion euros,including the goodwill impairment of LCL (-540 million euros), the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilitiesat the new French corporate tax rate as foreseen in the new finance law for 2020 (28%) ((cid:173)453 million euros), the 
Cariparma adjustment plan (-30 million euros) and recurring volatile accounting items (including issuer spreadfor  +52 million euros,  debt  valuation  adjustment  (DVA)  for  -2 million euros,  the  hedging  of  loan  portfolios((cid:173)1 million euros)inthe  Large  Customers  division  andthe  home  purchase  savings  provisionfor -182 million euros).Excluding these specific items, underlying net income Group share was 1,692 million euros, a decrease of-7.5% compared with the same quarter 2016.Underlying revenues were 8,235 million euros, an increase of +1.6% relative to the fourth quarter of 2016. Thisresult was obtained despite the positive impact from the integration of Pioneer, as this was more than offset by 
the decline in the Regional Banks’ revenues. At constant scope9, revenues were down -1.0% compared with the 
fourth quarter of 2016.Underlying  operating  expenses  increased  by  +4.0%  year-on-year  in the  fourth quarter 2017,  driven  by  theconsolidation of Pioneer coupled with investment in MTP projects, mainly for the Regional Banks. On a like-for-
like basis, the underlying expenses rose by +1.3%9. The underlying cost/income ratio stood at 64.9%.Cost of risk was 423 million euros,  down -7.6% compared to the same period of 2016. Cost  of risk relative to 
outstandings10 improved significantly to 17 basis points versus 28 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016. This 
is substantially lower than the Medium-Term Plan assumption of 35 basis points.7 Reduction of the standard corporate income tax rate, excluding the 3.3% social contribution applicable at the standard rate, to 33.33% in2017 and 2018, 31% in 2019, 28% in 2020, 26.5% in 2021 and 25% in 2022. It should be noted that France's finance law for 2016 had 
already anticipated a rate cut to 28% from 2020.8 See p. 19 for details of specific items for Crédit Agricole Group and p. 23 for a reconciliation of stated and underlying results.

Underlying operating expenses 
excluding SRF rose +3.0% (+1.6% on a like-for-like basis) while cost of credit risk fell by -33.6%, excluding the 
(cid:173)115 million euros  unallocated  legal  provision  charge  recognised  in  the  first  and  third  quarters  of  2017(40 million euros and 75 million euros respectively) versus 100 million euros in the second and third quarters of2016 (50 million euros each).In  the  fourth quarter 2017,  the  Regional Banks  enjoyed  sustained  business  momentum.  The  loan  bookincreased by +6.3% year-on-year at end-December, including +8.1% for home loans and +9.0% for consumer 
finance (including +15.6% for the loan book managed by CACF, which now represents 59% of total consumerfinance loans booked in the balance sheet of the Regional Banks). Customer savings increased by +4.2% year-on-year, driven by demand deposits (+13.4%). Life insurance assets under management increased by +2.2%, 
but  the  proportion  of  unit-linked  inflows  rose  by  +7 percentage points  year-on-year  to  25.1%  in  thefourth quarter 2017.  Lastly,  the  number  of  property  and  personal  insurance  contracts  increased  by  +6.7%compared to end-December 2016, of which +8.1% in comprehensive household.This commercial performance made a significant contribution to growth in Credit Agricole S.A.'s business lines,whose products are distributed by the Regional Banks as the Group's leading distribution channel and leadingretail bank in France.The contribution of the Regional Banks to Crédit Agricole Group’s underlying net income Group share came to 
764 million euros,  a decrease of  -15.2%  compared  with the fourth quarter 2016.  Underlying  revenues,  whichdeclined -2.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, amounted to 3,364 million euros. Fee income was strong 
and stable year-on-year. By contrast, low interest rates in the fourth quarter put pressure on the interest margin,which  remained  contracted.  Underlying  costs  excluding  the  contribution  to  the  Single  Resolution  Fund  (SRF)were  near-stable  (-0.3%)  at  2,153 million euros,  a  result  obtained  despite  investments  in  IT  (regulatoryrequirements, digital transformation) and the branch refurbishment programme scheduled in the MTP.Unlike in previous quarters, cost of risk rose. However, this rise is relative to a very  low level recorded in thefourth quarter in 2016, and cost of risk nonetheless remained quite low at 86 million euros. Furthermore, overallcost of risk fell for the year, amounting to 18 basis points.In 2017, the Regional Banks contributed 3,075 million euros, a decrease of -4.6% due mainly to the costs andloss of revenue related to the Eureka operation, which did not impact results before their implementation date on 
3 August 2016. Thus, underlying revenues fell by -3.7% to 13,313 million euros, while underlying costs excludingthe SRF contribution rose in connection with the IT investments scheduled under the MTP. Meanwhile, cost ofrisk dropped sharply (-64.8%) to 218 million euros, which amounts to 5 basis points over the second half of theyear, annualised.The performance of the other Credit Agricole Group business lines is described in detail in the section  of thispress release on Credit Agricole S.A.In  the  quarter,  Crédit Agricole Group’s  financial  solidity  remained  robust,  with  a  fully-loaded  CET1  ratio  of 
14.9%. This result was stable relative to the end of September 2017, despite the acquisitions of the three Italianbanks  and  the  private  banking  business  of  CM-CIC  in  Asia.  The  ratio  provides  a  substantial  buffer(540 basis points) above the distribution restriction trigger applicable to Credit Agricole Group as of 1 January2019, confirmed in December 2017 at 9.5% by the ECB.The TLAC ratio stood at 20.6% at 31 December 2017, excluding eligible senior preferred debt. It is unchangedfrom 30 September 2017 and compares with a ratio of 20.3% at the end of December 2016, excluding eligible 
senior preferred debt. It exceeds the minimum requirement of 19.5% from 2019, which can include up to 2.5% ofeligible senior preferred debt.  In 2017, the Group issued the equivalent of 6.2 billion euros in senior non-preferreddebt. The TLAC ratio target of 22% by 2019, excluding eligible senior preferred debt, is confirmed. To meet this 
target, in a context of strong credit activity in France in 2016 and 2017, which is likely to continue into 2019, the12 Aggregate of the contributions to underlying net income of Amundi and Pioneer Investments and taking into account the amortisation ofdistribution contracts in 2017 and 2016Results for the fourth quarter and full year 20177/28Group may adjust the TLAC issuance programme by 2 to 3 billion euros cumulative over the two years2018 and 2019.The phased-in leverage ratio came to 5.6%, stable compared with end-September 2017.Credit Agricole Group's  liquidity  position  is  solid.  Its  banking  cash  balance  sheet,  at  1,148 billion euros  at  31December  2017,  showed  a  surplus  of  stable  resources  over  long  term  applications  of  122 billion euros,  up 
+1 billion euros compared with end-September 2017 and +11 billion euros over the year. The surplus exceededthe MTP target of over 100 billion euros. The surplus of stable resources finances the HQLA (High Quality LiquidAssets)  securities  portfolio  generated  by  the  LCR  (Liquidity  Coverage  Ratio)  requirement  for  customer  and 
customer-related activities. Liquidity reserves, at market value and after haircuts, amounted to 248 billion eurosat 31 December 2017. Short-term debt net of Central Bank deposits (24 billion euros) was covered more thanfour times by HQLA securities (113 billion euros). The Group’s average LCR ratio over twelve months stood at133% at end-December 2017, above the Medium-Term Plan target of over 110%.Over the course of 2017, Crédit Agricole Group issuers raised the equivalent of 36.1 billion euros of medium-tolong term debt, of which 46% was issued by Crédit Agricole S.A. (the equivalent of 16.6 billion euros), compared 
to 33.1 billion euros equivalent raised over 2016. Besides, 3.4 billion euros were also placed in Crédit AgricoleGroup’s retail networks (Regional Banks, LCL, CA Italia).As  regards  the  implementation  of  IFRS9  as  from  1 January 2018,  the  negative  impact  of  -30 basis points  onCrédit Agricole S.A.’s  fully-loaded CET1 ratio,  disclosed  in  March 2016  along  with  the  Medium Term Plan,  isconfirmed,  corresponding  to  a  First  Time  Application  (FTA)  impact  of  approximately  -1.2 billion euros  at1 January 2018.  The  impact  for  Crédit Agricole Group  will  be  similar,  at  approximately  -30 basis points 
or  -1.4 billion euros  in  FTA  impact.  The  impact  on  the  TLAC  ratio  is  expected  to  be  -24 basis points.CA Assurances (insurance business line) will adopt IFRS9 as from 1 January 2018, and will apply the “Overlay”method to align the profit and loss impact with IAS39 rules, so as to ensure a better comparison with its peer 
insurers. The full financial statements under IFRS9 will be disclosed along with the first quarter 2018 earnings,full FTA details along with second quarter earnings.***Dominique Lefebvre, Chairman of SAS Rue La Boétie and Chairman of Credit Agricole S.A.'s Board of Directors,

The  results  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2017  were  penalised  by  a  high  tax  burden  inconnection to changes in tax rules in France and, to a lesser extent, the United States (see section above on 
Crédit Agricole Group). These factors had a negative impact of -384 million euros on net income Group share.The  impacts  of  these  changes  were  recorded  under  specific  items.  Specific  items  were  quite  significant  thisquarter; that was also true (albeit to a lesser degree) of the same period of 2016.13 In this press release, “underlying” refers to figures adjusted for the specific items on the P&L accounts described on p. 18 onwards

including  a  -384-million-euro  impact  attributable  to  tax  adjustments:  -326 million euros  from  the  exceptional 
surcharge in France, -128 million euros from the adjustment of future tax rates in France and the United States,but also a +69 million euros impact from the refund of France's 3% tax on dividend distributions. The quarter alsosaw  the  recognition  of  negative  goodwill  linked  to  the  consolidation  of  the  three  Italian  banks  for 
+312 million euros (408 million euros before non-controlling interests) and full goodwill impairment on the Polishentities, reflecting slower-than-expected profitability from the deployment of the retail banking model due to fiercecompetition on an attractive market and the recent tightening of the regulatory environment and interest rates, 
for -222 million euros. Other specific items recorded for the quarter include the integration costs of Pioneer andthe three Italian banks (total impact of -54 million euros on net income Group share), the impact of changes inthe issuer spread (-62 million euros), the penalty associated with the Check Image Exchange ((cid:173)58 million euros) 
and  changes  in  provisions  for  home  purchase  savings  plans  (+3 million euros),  with  miscellaneous  items 
comprising  the  rest  (-25 million euros).  In  the  fourth  quarter  of 2016,  specific  items  had  an  impactof  -667 million euros  on  net income Group share,  mainly  comprising  the  goodwill  impairment  of  LCL(-491 million euros).Excluding  these  specific  items,  underlying  net  income  Group  share  for  the  fourth quarter 2017  came  to878 million euros, a decrease of -8.4% compared with the fourth quarter 2016. As in the third quarter, thisdecrease stemmed mainly from the return to a more normal effective tax rate, which rose from 25.2% in the fourthquarter  of  2016  to  28.9%  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2017  (excluding  the  impacts  of  the  aforementioned  specificitems). The resulting increase in the tax charge (+24.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2016) more than offset the 
decrease  in  credit  risk  provisions  (-15.1%  versus  the  fourth  quarter  of  2016)  and  the  slight  increase  in  grossoperating income (+1.6%). It should be noted that the contribution of equity-accounted entities fell significantlydue to the disposal of the 15.4% stake in Eurazeo (June 2017) and the deconsolidation of BSF following the saleof a 16.2% interest (September 2017).Table 3.

networks, as well as the Regional Banks which distribute the products of its specialised business lines. Theacceleration of the economic recovery has led to improved demand for corporate credit and strong savings flowsin the countries  where the  Group is active. These trends have been amplified  by cross selling  in line  with thecustomer-focused universal banking model, a core component of the “Strategic Ambition 2020” plan.Like the rest of the year, business activity this quarter was strong across all the business lines:-Insurance  recorded  12.7  million  property  &  casualty  contracts,  an  increase  of  683,000  net  ofterminations (+5.6%  year-on-year). Revenue from property  & casualty insurance rose +4.8%  year-on-
year  in  the  fourth  quarter.  In  life  insurance,  net  inflows  amounted  to  +1.1 billion euros  in  the  fourthquarter  of  2017,  with  1.0 billion euros  attributable  to  unit-linked  (UL)  inflows.  Unit-linked  accounts 
represented 21.4% of savings and retirement outstandings, an increase of +1.9 percentage points year-on-year;-In Asset Management (Amundi), assets under management rose to 1.426 trillion euros, an increase of 
+31.7% relative to the end of 2016 (+7.3% on a like-for-like basis19). This result can be attributed to a 
positive  market  effect  and,  most  importantly,  strong  net  inflows  of  +73.1 billion euros  over  the  year,including  the  six-month  contribution  by  Pioneer  (+70.6 billion euros  using  combined  approach), 
+13.1 billion euros  in  the  fourth  quarter,  driven  by  the  Retail  segment  (+50.3 billion euros  in  2017,+14.2 billion euros in Q4) and medium/long-term assets (36.2 billion euros in 2017, +10.4 billion euros inQ4);-The Retail Banking in France and Italy posted strong momentum in credit and inflows. The quarter sawa slowdown in real estate lending offset by lending to businesses and strong consumer credit production. 
Loans  outstanding  for  LCL  rose  +8.4%  year-on-year  (including  +7.4%  for  home  loans,  +11.7%  forbusiness loans). The total number of property & casualty insurance contracts increased by +7% year-on-
year, while the market penetration of non-life insurance rose by 2 percentage points in two years. Retail 
Banking in Italy continued to outperform the local market in home loans (+9.4%20 versus +2.2%), while 
off-balance sheet customer assets grew by +5.7%20 over one year;-  Specialised  Financial  Services  saw  +6.9%  growth  in  the  managed  loan  book  in  consumer  financecompared to 31 December 2016 (+10.5 billion euros of new managed business in the fourth quarter, with 
the Regional  Banks driving much of the performance in December), +4.4%21 in new  leasing  business

to the fourth quarter of 2016, or +0.7%/+34 million euros on a like-for-like basis25. The quarterly growth results 
were impacted by three items that influenced the basis of comparison: (i) the initial consolidation of what was 
formerly  a  loss-making  subsidiary26  within  the  Corporate  Centre,  which  had  a  non-recurring  impact 
of -23 million euros on revenues (but no impact net income Group share) for the quarter, (ii) the sharp decline (-30 million euros) in renegotiation fees and prepayment fees for LCL and (iii) the decision not to offset the costassociated with deferred tax assets in insurance revenues, unlike in the fourth quarter of 2016 (the expense was 
80 million euros; insurance revenues fell by -23 million euros between the two periods). Nonetheless, underlying 
revenues grew considerably for Asset Management (+12.0% on a like-for-like basis25 compared with the fourth 
quarter of 2016), boosted by an increase in assets under management and strong results in performance fees 
and  financial  income,  and  for  the  Large  Customers  business  line  (+4.9%)  thanks  to  strong  growth  in  AssetServicing (+14%) and the recovery in Commercial Banking (11% despite low volatility on the interest rate/forexmarkets; increase of only 1% in Capital Markets).Underlying  operating  expenses 
fourth  quarter  and  by 
+2.8%/85 million euros  on  a  like-for-like  basis25.  This  increase  (in  underlying  terms,  so  excluding  the 
integration costs for Pioneer and the three Italian banks) is attributable to non-recurring IT depreciation expenses 
in  the  Insurance  business  (32 million euros)  and  investments  in  business  and  digital  development  in  variousincreased  by  +7.5%  year-on-yearinthebusiness lines. A significant share of these investments is financed through cost savings programmes in line withthe Strategic Ambition 2020 plan. Thus, despite these investments, many of the business lines have some of the 
best underlying cost/income ratios in their sectors: 33.1% for Insurance, 52.9% for Amundi, 51.2% for SFS, 53.4%for BFI and 76.3% for Asset Servicing.The underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF was 65.5%.Cost of risk fell -15.1% (-60 million euros) to 335 million euros, compared to 395 million euros in the fourthquarter  of  2016.  This  decrease  was  entirely  attributable  to  the  financing  business  of  the  Large  Customersbusiness line (-66.5%/-59 million euros compared to the fourth quarter of 2016). The other business lines were 
stable overall,  with the exception of Consumer Finance, which dropped  -18.6%/-20 million euros compared  tothe same period of 2016.Cost  of  risk  relative  to  outstandings  amounted  to  29 basis  points27,  in  line  the  past  year's  trend  of 
consecutive quarterly declines (-12 basis points compared to the same quarter of the previous year, -2 basispoints versus the preceding quarter) and still below the Medium-Term Plan assumption of 50 basis points.The  underlying  contribution  from  equity-accounted  entities  was  down  -44.6%  (-56 million euros)  to69 million euros, reflecting  the  loss of the  Eurazeo contribution (33 million euros  in the fourth quarter of 2016)following its disposal in the second quarter of 2017, and the deconsolidation in the third quarter of 2017 of theGroup’s  interest  in  BSF  following  its  partial  disposal  (decrease  from  31.1%  to  14.9%),  amounting  to 
29 million euros in the fourth quarter of 2016. The contribution from other equity-accounted entities is growing,especially  Amundi's  joint  ventures  in  Asia  and  consumer  loan  partnerships  with  Fiat-Chrysler  and  Chineseautomobile maker GAC.Underlying  pre-tax  income before  discontinued  operations  and  non-controlling  interests  increased  by+3.8% to 1,410 million euros. The underlying effective tax rate was 28.9% versus 25.2% in the fourth quarter of2016, which had benefited from a reduced rate of tax on several transactions during the quarter, particularly for 
Consumer Finance and Asset Servicing. This rate is significantly lower than the standard corporate income taxrate in France due to the generation of earnings in countries with a lower tax rate and to the tax credit available25 Aggregate of the contributions to underlying net income of Amundi and Pioneer Investments and taking into account the amortisation ofdistribution contracts in 2017 and 201626 Crédit Agricole S.A.'s holding in Fireca had been subject to impairment. As such, initial consolidation entailed the full consolidation ofdeficits accumulated since the equity position was taken, in revenues, net of the impairment recognised on the ownership interest (50%). 
Accordingly, the outstanding balance was allocated to non-controlling interests, with an impact of zero on net income Group share.27 Average loan loss reserves over last four rolling quarters, annualisedResults for the fourth quarter and full year 201712/28on Additional Tier 1 debt instruments (interest payments are deducted directly from equity, for -136 million euros 
in the fourth quarter), representing an impact of -2.5 percentage points on the underlying effective tax rate. Theunderlying tax charge was therefore up +24.4% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, to 387 million euros.Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was up significantly, by +13.2% to 123 million euros, dueto the decrease in the Group’s interest in Amundi to 68.5% as of the second quarter of 2017 versus 74.1% in the 
fourth  quarter  of  2016  and  up  to  and  including  the  first  quarter  of  2017,  but  also  this  quarter  due  to  theconsolidation of Pioneer Investments, which contributed to the +65.2% growth in Amundi’s net income at 100%.Net  income  for  Amundi  attributable  to  non-controlling  interests  rose  by  39 million euros.  If  excluding  Amundi, 
there would be a decline for non-controlling interests due to the initial consolidation, within the Corporate Centre, 
of Fireca, a loss-making subsidiary 50% owned by Crédit Agricole S.A.28.Consequently, underlying net income Group share came to 878 million euros, a decrease of -8.4% comparedwith the fourth quarter 2016.For 2017 as a whole, stated net income Group share totalled 3,649 million euros. This result amounts to a+3.1% increase over the 3,541 million euros recorded for 2016, even though the 1,272 million euro gain on theEureka operation had been recorded that year. Strong organic growth by the businesses, and, to a lesser extent,the integration of Pioneer Investments were therefore able to offset, in one year, the non-recurrence of this gainin stated net income Group share:In 2017, specific items29 had a negative impact on net income Group share of -276 million euros. In addition 
to the specific items of the fourth quarter mentioned above, the most significant specific items were the gains on 
disposal of the Group’s interest in Eurazeo (+103 million euros) in the second quarter and BSF in the third quarter(+99 million euros). The other specific items saw their effects offset relative to the fourth quarter, most notablyissuer spread (-131 million euros on net income Group share), the debt value adjustment ((cid:173)42 million euros) andloan portfolio hedges (-36 million euros).In 2016, specific items had an impact on  net income Group share of  +351 million euros,   and in particularcomprised 
the  Visa  Europe  capital  gain 
(+327 million euros), the dividends earned from the Regional Banks prior to the disposal of the interest in theirthe  aforementioned  Eureka  gain(1,272 million euros),share  capital  as  part  of  the  Eureka  operation  (+285 million euros),  the  goodwill  impairment  of  LCL((cid:173)491 million euros),  considerations  on  debt  repayment  operations  (-448 million euros)  and  macro-hedging

by  higher  legal  provisions  (115 million euros  versus  100 million euros  in  2016)  and  a  higher  effective  tax  rate(from  24.3%  in  2016  to  26.8%  in  2017).  As  in  the  fourth  quarter,  the  tax  credit  on  Additional  Tier  1  couponsdecreased the effective tax rate by 3 points (4 points in 2016).Underlying revenues were 18,772 million euros, a year-on-year increase of +7.2% or +4.8% like-for-like30. All 
the divisions contributed to the increase except Retail Banking, which continued to be affected by the low interestrate environment and the impacts of the devaluation of the Egyptian pound on the local subsidiary's revenues. 
Particularly  strong  performance  was  recorded  in  Asset  Gathering  (following  the  integration  of  PioneerInvestments and organic growth in Asset Management), Large Customers and the Corporate Centre, thanks tothe Eureka impact and a decrease in funding costs.Underlying  operating  expenses  were  up  slightly  to  11,785 million euros  or  +3.7%,  excluding  the  SRF 
contribution,  which  remained  relatively  stable  (+0.5%  to  242 million euros).  On  a  constant  scope30,  operating 
expenses excluding SRF increased by only +1.3%, reflecting excellent cost control. All business contributed to 
this  cost  control.  The  most  substantial  jaws  effect31  came  from  LCL  (+2.5 percentage points  excluding  SRF), 
customers 
Specialised(+1.2 percentage points  excluding  SRF),  and  Largefinancialservices(+1.6 percentage points excluding SRF), particularly Asset financing (+4.2 percentage points excluding SRF).The underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF improved by 2.1 percentage points to 62.8% compared with2016.Lastly, cost of credit risk excluding unallocated legal provisions fell by -22.5% to 1,307 million euros versus1,687 million euros  in  2016  (or  -380 million euros).  As  in  the  fourth quarter,  the  main  contributor  to  theimprovement was the Large customers division (-55.5% or -254 million euros) and Specialised financial services(-21.1%  or  -118 million euros).  At  LCL,  cost  of  credit  risk  increased  by  +12.1%  (+22 million euros  to30 Aggregate of the contributions to underlying net income of Amundi and Pioneer Investments and taking into account the amortisation ofdistribution contracts in 2017 and 201631 Difference between growth in revenues and growth in operating expensesResults for the fourth quarter and full year 201714/28204 million euros),  mainly  due  to  non-recurring  reversals  in  the  first quarter 2016  which  lowered  the  base  forcomparison, and the provisions in the third quarter 2017 related to Hurricane Irma, but the cost of risk nonetheless 
remains very low in this business line. In Retail Banking in Italy, provisions increased slightly due to the transferof  Calit's  contribution  as  of  1  January  2017  and  the  subsidiary's  significant  third  quarter  credit  losses.  The 
impaired loans ratio of IRB-Italy (excluding Calit) was down -1.6 percentage points to 11.5%32 (versus 13.1% at 
end-December 2016  and  12.4%  at  end-September 2017)  thanks  to  the  improvement  of  the  portfolio  and  theintegration of the three Italian banks, for which the impaired loans ratio was under 10% further to the disposal of 
3 billion euros of impaired loans ahead of the acquisition. The coverage ratio also improved, reaching 50.1% 32 
(versus 46.5% at end-December 2016 and 48% at end-September 2017).Crédit Agricole S.A.'s solvency situation remained solid at the end of December 2017, with a fully-loaded CET1ratio of 11.7%, a decrease of -30 basis points from 30 September 2017, which is attributable to the integrationof the  three Italian banks and the private banking business of CM-CIC in  Asia,  with a net  impact of  -18 basis 
points. In view of the decision not to include the tax surcharge in the dividend calculation, net income (excludingnegative  goodwill  on  the  three  Italian  banks,  included  in  the  impact  of  this  operation)  allocated  to  retainedearnings  net  of  the  dividend  proposed  to  the  Annual  Shareholders’  Meeting  and  Additional  Tier  1  interest 
payments contributed negatively to the ratio's performance in the fourth quarter (-5 basis points); the other itemshad a net negative impact of -9 basis points. Risk-weighted assets totalled 296 billion euros at end-December2017,  compared  to 301 billion euros  at  end-December  2016  and  293 billion euros  at end-September,  with thegrowth in the fourth quarter mostly attributable to the integration of the three Italian banks (+4.1 billion euros).The phased-in leverage ratio was 4.4% at end-December 2017 as defined in the Delegated Act adopted by theEuropean Commission.Crédit Agricole S.A.’s average LCR ratio over twelve months stood at 137% at end-December 2017, above theMedium-Term Plan target of over 110%.At the end of 2017, Credit Agricole S.A. had completed 104% of its medium- to long term market funding 
programme of 16 billion euros for the year: 16.6 billion euros equivalent were raised on the markets, of which10.4 billion euros  equivalent  of  senior  preferred  debt  and  of  senior  secured  debt,  as  well  as    6.2 billion eurosequivalent  of  senior  non-preferred  debt.  The  2018  MLT  market  funding  programme  is  set  at  12 billion euros, 
including 4 to 5 billion euros of Tier 2 or senior non-preferred debt. At 31 January 2018, 20% of this programmewas completed, including the issuance at end-January of 1.25 billion USD of Tier 2 instrument.In view of this financial strength, the Board of Directors decided not to include the tax surcharge that impactedthe fourth quarter's results and to neutralise this expense for shareholders by offering the Annual Shareholders’Meeting a dividend of 0.63 euro per share, entailing a 56% payout ratio on stated attributable net income Groupshare, which is significantly higher than the 50% target payout ratio in the Medium-Term Plan.***Philippe Brassac, Chief Executive Officer, commented: “In 2017, Crédit Agricole S.A. demonstrated a real 
ability to innovate to serve its customers by investing in its digital transformation and the development of its 
businesses while maintaining a high level of operational efficiency: revenues increased, at constant scope, at 
twice the rate expected by the Strategic Ambition 2020 Plan, the cost / income ratio improved by more than two 
points, and the return on tangible capital exceeded 11%.”32 Excluding leasingResults for the fourth quarter and full year 201715/28Compensation for shareholders eligible for the loyalty 
dividendOn 20 December 2017, Crédit Agricole S.A. announced it would submit a proposal to the General Meeting ofShareholders to be held on 16 May 2018 to remove the loyalty dividend clause from its articles of association.The European Banking Authority (EBA) has ruled that the payment of a loyalty dividend constitutes a “preferentialdistribution”  in  breach  of  the  Capital  Requirements  Regulation  (CRR).  This  ruling  has  been  upheld  by  theEuropean Central Bank (ECB).To compensate beneficiaries, Crédit Agricole S.A. will award eligible shareholders one new ordinary share for 26registered shares entitled to a loyalty dividend in respect of the 2017 fiscal year*. Given the weighted average 
price of  the  Crédit  Agricole  SA  share  observed  over  a 60-day  trading  period  completed on  the  evening of  12February 2018 (€ 14.55), the value of the compensation amounts to approximately 56 cents per share.The  compensation  amount  was  determined  in  an  independent  appraisal  by  Ledouble,  which  calculated  the 
amount payable to compensate eligible shareholders for the removal of the loyalty dividend based on three mainfactors: projected future dividends, the estimated average holding period of loyalty shares, and discounted cashflows. At its meeting on 13 February, the Board of Directors set the compensation amount within the price range 
proposed by Ledouble at between €0.45 and €0.63 in order to achieve a balance between the interests of eligibleshareholders and other shareholders.The removal of the loyalty dividend clause and the terms of compensation for beneficiaries is subject to approval 
by a special meeting of eligible shareholders that will be held on 4 April 2018 and by the Extraordinary AnnualGeneral Meeting to be held on 16 May 2018.* Only Crédit Agricole SA shares held in registered form continuously from 31 December 2015 through to thedividend payment date for the 2017 financial year are eligible for the loyalty dividend for 2017.Results for the fourth quarter and full year 201716/28Corporate social responsibilityClimate commitmentsTwo years after the Paris Agreement on climate change, Crédit Agricole Group has decided to extend and clarifythe commitments it made in 2015 on the sidelines of the COP21 by increasing green financing, including climate 
issues  in  risk  assessments,  excluding  hydrocarbons  that  cause  the  most  damage  to  the  environment  andoffsetting its entire direct carbon footprint until 2040:  To arrange  100 billion euros in green financing around the world by  2020. Crédit Agricole is extending thecommitment it made at the COP21 to arrange 60 billion euros in green financing by 2018.  With the Regional Banks and LCL, to finance one in three renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in 
France  by  2020. With  this  measure,  Crédit  Agricole  intends  to  double  financing  for  renewable  energies  in 
France.  To take into account climate issues in our risk assessments of large clients and their projects, as of the endof 2017. We will gradually extend this process to other client categories.  To exclude the least energy efficient hydrocarbons and those that pose the greatest threat to the environment, 
because these are incompatible with the goal of combating climate change and they represent an economic 
risk for investors. This means turning down projects and companies that do the majority of their business in:o  Oil sands production, 
o  Oil extracted from the Arctic region (off-shore and on-shore production), 
o  Shale gas or oil production involving excessive flaring or venting, 
oInfrastructure  projects  mainly  intended  for  schemes  covered  by  the  exclusion  criteria  set  out 
above,  Crédit  Agricole  S.A.  is  committed  to  offsetting  the  Group's  entire  direct  carbon  footprint  until  2040  via  theLivelihoods carbon fund.FReD IndexCrédit  Agricole  S.A.  publishes  the  results  of  its  “FReD  Index”,  which  measures  the  yearly  progress  made  by
