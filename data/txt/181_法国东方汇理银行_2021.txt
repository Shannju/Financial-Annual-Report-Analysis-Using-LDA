Customer-focused Banking model. Gross customer acquisition was strong. In the whole year 2021, the Group 
recorded +1,701,000 new Retail banking customers, 1,560,000 of them in France (1,218,000 customers for the 
Regional  Banks)  and  140,000  in  Italy,  while  the  customer  base  continued  to  grow  (+278,000  retail  banking 
customers, 226,000 of them Regional Bank customers and 256,000 customers in France). In the fourth quarter 
of 2021, the Group gained +391,000 new retail banking customers, of which 360,000 of them in France (284,000 
for the Regional Banks) and 31,000 in Italy. In addition, the production of loans in retail banking in France rose 
in the fourth quarter, by +1.3%4 compared to fourth quarter 2019 and increased significantly over 2021 by +6.9% 
compared to 2019. Premium income from property and casualty insurance was also up sharply (+15.7% since 
the fourth quarter of 2019) while consumer finance and leasing production grew +1.5% compared to the same 
period.  The  equipment  rate  of  Regional  Banks,  LCL  and  CA  Italia  also  posted  an  increase  since  end  2020 
(+1 percentage points, +1.1 percentage points and +1.9 percentage points respectively) to 42.7%, 26.6% and 
19% respectively at 31 December 2021.Group ProjectCustomer and human-centric projects - amplification of the universal customer-focused banking model: 
digital technology and empowered local teams.This year, the Group continued to amplify the universal customer-focused banking model, which combines digital 
technology and empowered local teams. The Crédit Agricole Group’s offers are constantly adapted to the needs 
of its customers. 2021 saw the launch of several inclusive and flexible packages.In line with its universal banking model, the Crédit Agricole Group aims to make essential day-to-day banking 
services available to all, both online and in branches, in particular through the EKO and LCL Essentiel offers. For 
young people, the Globetrotter and LCL City Explorer offers provide an international payment card with no foreign 
payment fees. The insurance activity is also developing inclusive offers: the EKO Crédit Agricole Assurance and 
Primo LCL packages offer a car insurance service that is accessible to all with no limits on essential coverage.In addition, Crédit Agricole gives all customers access to the bank’s premium services with its flexible Nouvelle 
Banque  du  Quotidien  offer,  which  includes  “essential”,  “premium”  and  “prestige”  packages.  For  December 
2021, the premiumisation rate was 23%.The  Crédit  Agricole  Group  is  also  constantly  improving  its  offers  and  services  through  innovation  and  the 
digitalisation of the customer experience. As a result, the Group’s app usage rate (active profile on apps in 
the last month) rose sharply this year, recording an increase at the Regional Banks and at LCL (respectively, +18 
percentage points compared to January 2019 to 45.5% and +20.5 percentage points to 57.4%). Similarly, the 
Group continues to deploy innovative digital tools for its customers and in particular for young people to facilitate 
their activities, such as the digital “piggy bank” on the CA Italia application (which allows amounts as small as €5 
to be saved and invested in a mutual fund at any time with a simple click on a mobile phone), and Plick, a new 
private  payment  service  also  developed  by  CA  Italia  (which  allows  payments  to  be  made  throughout  Europe 
without an IBAN, using only the beneficiary’s mobile phone number or e-mail). Innovative non-banking platforms 
and services have also been set up, such as Vizio Client (which allows face-to-face exchanges with one’s advisor4 Excluding state-guaranteed loans for Q3-2020 (€2.6 billion) and negligible for Q3-20213/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021and  sharing  and  viewing  documents  during  a  videoconference  call)  and  platforms  for  young  people  and 
professionals (Youzful, Blank, Yapla).However, Crédit Agricole Group goes the extra mile and enhances the digital experience and the strength of its 
offers and services for its customers through customer-focused empowered local teams.  The inclusion of an 
“empowerment index” in this year's ERI (Engagement and Recommendation Index) survey is a good illustration 
of this, as is the strong increase in the participation rate of employees in the ERI survey (81%, +1 point compared 
to  2020).  In  addition,  the  Group  launched  innovative  measures  in  managerial  transformation,  supported  by 
organisational transformation, to ramp up the employee empowement process, aimed at creating more value for 
customers. Lastly, the Crédit Agricole Group continues to take steps to promote gender equality. 31% of Crédit 
Agricole S.A.’s Executive Committee is made up of women as of the end of 2021.Finally, this year’s achievements were made possible thanks to the full mobilisation of the Group’s employees.As a result of all these actions, the Group’s positioning in terms of customer satisfaction continued to improve: 
Crédit  Agricole  is  now  at  the  top  of  the  “France’s  favourite  brand”  ranking  in  the  banking  category.  Crédit 
Agricole’s Net Promoter Score (NPS) rose in 2021 from 2020 (+2 points to +10), placing it in the top three French 
banks in terms of customer satisfaction. After being recognised during lockdown as the leading bank in terms 
of contactability, LCL was awarded the “2022 Customer Service of the Year” trophy and received the prize for 
the best remote customer service and bank branch of the year (Trophée 2022 Moneyvox). Finally, the Sofinco 
website was elected “Best User Experience” in 2021.The Group’s societal project – societal commitment for energy transition and social cohesionThe Group’s commitment to the energy transition has two main components: the Group’s support for the energy 
transition of corporates and individual customers, and the progressive reallocation of financing and investment 
portfolios towards green assets.There  are  several  concrete  examples  of  the  Group’s  commitment  to  support  its  customers  in  their  transition 
strategies in 2021. Indeed, 8,000 listed companies have been assigned transition scores, i.e. a single score used 
by  CACIB  and  Amundi  to  better  support  and  meet  the  energy  transition  needs  of  their  customers.  CACIB 
confirmed its position as one of the world’s top five green, social and sustainable bond arrangers (with $46 billion 
of bonds arranged in 2021). At Amundi, the assets under management dedicated to social and environmental 
solutions totalled €35 billion in 2021. In addition, CACF granted financing in the amount of €2 billion for vehicles 
emitting  less  than  95  g  of  carbon  dioxide  per  km.  Lastly,  according  to  a  May  2021  Bloomberg  study,  Crédit 
Agricole CIB is the first bank among the 30 largest worldwide banks to have arranged more green financing since 
the beginning of 2016 than hydrocarbon financing.Several concrete examples of the reallocation of financing and investment portfolios towards green assets can 
also be noted 2021. CACIB’s green loan portfolio amounts to €13.2 billion at year end. CAA has invested €2.5 
billion in renewable energies (i.e. an installed capacity of close to 8.5 GW), and 100% of Amundi’s open-ended 
active  management  funds  have  an  ESG  score  target5  above  the  score  for  the  investment  universe.  Finally, 
CALEF  is,  once  again  this  year,  the  first  private  provider  of  renewable  energy  financing6,  with  €2.6  billion 
outstandings in 2021.The  Group’s  Societal  Project  covers  the  Group’s  societal  commitment  to  both  energy  transition  and  social 
cohesion. The Group's commitment in this area includes support for young people and the regions. The Crédit 
Agricole Group was the second largest private recruiter7 of work-study students in France in 2021. In addition, 
CACF and the Regional Banks have developed support measures to help limit over-indebtedness and combat 
fragility:  4,200  over-indebted  customers  were  accompanied  by  CACF  this  year,  and  10,000  families  were 
supported  by  the  Regional  Banks’  “Points  Passerelle”  scheme.  Lastly,  on  a  different  note,  social  investment5 When an ESG methodology is applicable

CAA ranges.In addition, in 2021, as part of its Societal Project, the Crédit Agricole Group presented a programme with 10 
ambitious commitments in the area of climate, social cohesion and inclusion, and agriculture, embedded within 
the activities of the Group.The first part of this programme involves acting for the climate and the transition to a low-carbon economy 
through:1.  Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 in our own footprint and in our investment and financing 
portfolios. The Group’s business lines have signed on to all collective commitments made by the major 
financial  institutions,  joining  business  alliances  to  contribute  to  carbon  neutrality  by  2050.  These 
commitments  are  supplemented  by  specific  commitments  starting  in  2022:  a  total  halt  to  all  project 
finance  directly  linked  to  the  extraction  of  unconventional  hydrocarbons  starting  in  January  2022; 
protection of the Arctic region, where we prohibit all direct financing of oil and gas projects; significant 
reduction in our exposure to oil extraction by 20% by 2025; for investment, by 2025, 100% of Amundi’s 
open-ended  active  management  funds,  representing  €400bn  today,  will  aim  to  have  a  better  energy 
transition rating than their benchmark universe. In addition, the Group is committed to the financing of 
renewable  energy.  Already  one  of  the  world’s  leading  issuers  of  green  bonds  and  France’s  leading 
provider of renewable energy financing, Crédit Agricole intends to multiply its impact: €20bn committed 
by 2025, via Amundi, in funds that will invest in companies that contribute positively to environmental or 
social performance (Article 9 SFDR impact funds). Crédit Agricole also aims to double the production 
capacity  of  renewable  energy  facilities  financed  by  Crédit  Agricole  Assurances  to  reach  10.5  GW  by 
2025, i.e. the average energy consumption of 4 million households. Crédit Agricole CIB’s exposure to 
non-carbon energies  will  increase by  60% by  2025,  and the  development of its  platform dedicated to 
advising on and financing hydrogen projects will accelerate. Other targets include the 50% growth in the 
financing of renewable energy projects in France by 2025 by Unifergie, a subsidiary of Crédit Agricole 
Leasing & Factoring (1 project out of 3 in France), and making energy transition a focus of the real estate 
master plan for Crédit Agricole Immobilier. Lastly, the Group is making responsible savings accessible, 
launching a range of “green” savings books starting in 2022 and a “green” savings plan starting in 2023.2.  Advising  and  supporting  100%  of  our  customers  through  their  energy  transition,  in  particular 
through the Agilauto offer, which provides access to clean vehicles, or the “J’écorénove mon logement” 
offer  for  homes,  or,  for  the  SME  and  small  business  customers  of  the  Regional  Banks,  the  “Objectif 
Transition Energétique” platform. In addition, Credit Agricole commits itself to use its agencies to equip 
territories with electric vehicle charging station.3.  The inclusion of non-financial criteria in 100% of financing for corporate and farmers.The second part of this programme plan aims to strengthen cohesion and social inclusion through:4.  A range of offers that ensures no customers are excluded, to promote social and digital inclusion 
and  adapt  to  economic  and  societal  changes,  including  the  “Living  well  at  home”  offer  for  senior 
customers, enhanced with a digital and human-centred offer with simplified diagnostics for carers and a 
package of services for carers, and EKO Assurances to make day-to-day insurance (housing, mobility) 
accessible to all without cutting back on the quality of basic coverage.5.  The  contribution  to  revitalising  the  most  vulnerable  areas  and  reducing  social  inequalities  bypromoting employment, solidarity, access to goods and services and digital technology6.  The  Group’s  commitment  to  the  integration  of  young  people  through  employment  and  training, 
through the welcoming and training 50,000 young people by 2025 in France and abroad, mostly through 
work-study programmes and internships7.Increasing gender equality and diversity in all Crédit Agricole S.A entities and within its governance, 
with a coordinated and global approach to set an example in our social policies, in particular with the5/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021commitment to reach between 30% and 40% of women among senior managers by 2025, depending on 
the Crédit Agricole S.A. entity, or to train 100% of the Group’s employees and elected representatives in 
CSR-related issues.The third and final part of this programme plan focuses on successfully achievin agricultural and agri-food 
transitions with:8.  Supporting the development of farming techniques to create a competitive and sustainable agri-food 
system. For this reason, Crédit Agricole is launching a pan-European private equity and debt fund with 
an objective of €1 billion.9.  Enabling French agriculture to fully contribute to the fight against climate change. In this context, 
starting in 2022, the Group will explore the usefulness of a French platform for trading carbon credits 
from French farms and will support all local projects that contribute to decarbonising agriculture.10.  Contributing  to  the  strengthening  of  food  sovereignty  by  facilitating  the  installation  of  newgenerations of farmers, deploying green savings accounts and offering short-channel platforms6/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021Finally, it should be noted that as at 31 December 2021, the energy mix of the energy portfolios of large corporate 
financing activities, asset management activities, investment activities linked to life insurance contracts and SME 
and mid-cap financing activities are as follows8 (see page 67 of the 2020 URD for a methodological explanation 
of the scope)-Large corporate financing activity: coal €348 million, oil €6,722 million, gas €5,166 million, nuclear €137 
million, renewable energy €4,834 million 9.-  Asset  management  activity:  coal  €1,202 million,  oil  €25,090 million,  gas  €11,905 million,  nuclear 
€3,556 million, renewable energies €3,224 million in connection with market trends and outstandings10.-Investments  related  to  life  insurance  contracts:  fossil  fuels  €8,084 million,  nuclear  €1,525 million, 
renewable energies €4,025 million11.-  SME and mid-cap financing activity: fossil fuels €123 million, renewable energies €268 million12.The  2020  and  2019  data  have  been  restated  from  the  figures  published  in  the  Statement  of  Non-Financial 
Performance  in  the  2020  URD  to  incorporate  the  revised  process  for  identifying  energy  commitments. These 
figures obtained via the Greenway platform are based on a financing scope of €178 billion at end 2021 and an 
investment scope of €482 billion.The Group's development modelThe financial targets announced for Crédit Agricole S.A. as part of the 2022 Medium-Term Plan were achieved 
in 2021, i.e. one year early:-  Underlying net income Group share is above the €5 billion target, reaching €5.4 billion in 2021-  The underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF exceeded its 60% target, reaching 57.8% in 2021-  The underlying RoTE reached 13.1% in 2021, above its target of 11%.-  The fully loaded CET1 ratio reached 11.9% in 2021, above its steering target of 11%.8 Presentation of methodological framework. The 2019, 2020 and 2021 coal exposure and energy mix data were estimated using the GreenWay Platform.The following estimation method was used:• For dedicated financing: the total amount outstanding on the balance sheet is recognised; 
• For investments and non-dedicated financing: the balance sheet amounts outstanding are weighted by the counterparty’s revenue distribution. This 
means that a correspondence is made between internal data (amounts outstanding) and external data (distribution of corporate revenues by energy 
produced, from “Trucost S&P”, at the end of 2021).For asset management activity: these data have been estimated by considering indirect exposure (percentage of the revenues of company investments 
made  in  energy).  To  arrive  at  this,  we  used  the  public  data  available  at  the  end  of  2021.  The  data  relate  to  assets  under  passive  and  active 
management but exclude delegated management (in the context of joint ventures or management under private banking mandates) as well as Amundi 
Immobilier assets, which represent 72% of total assets under management. For this scope, the Trucost data covers €482 billion of outstandings 
excluding subsidiaries.For large corporate financing activities: these data were estimated by considering both direct financing of dedicated assets and indirect exposures in 
energy production calculated on the basis of client revenues. To arrive at this, we used the public data available at the end of 2021. All on-balance-
sheet financing activities for large corporates are recognised (only the amounts outstanding on the assets side of the balance sheet are included). 
For this scope, the Trucost data covers €178.3 billion of financing.For investment activity linked to life insurance policies: these data have been estimated by considering non-unit-linked funds (percentage of customer 
revenues from energy). The data covers directly managed listed investments, listed investments managed under mandates and directly managed 
unlisted  investments.  Life  insurance  investment  activities  managed  under  asset  management  may  include  assets  already  counted  in  the  asset 
management activity section.For the financing activity of SMEs and mid-caps: these data have been estimated by considering the direct financing of dedicated assets in the energy 
production of SMEs and mid-caps. To arrive at this, the NAF codifications and data from the management tools for SME and mid-cap financing activity 
are used.9  Large  corporates  financing  activities  in  2020:    coal  €311 million,  oil  €5,953 million,  gas  €5,314 million,  nuclear  €65 million,  renewable  energy€4,004 million; and in 2019: coal €370 million, oil €6,746 million, gas €4,693 million, nuclear €61 million; renewable energies €3,162 million.10  Asset  management  activity  in  2020:    coal  €750 million,  oil  €18,715 million,  gas  €9,891 million,  nuclear  €2,898 million,  renewable  energies€2,682 million; and in 2019: coal €714 million, oil €20,838 million, gas €10,149 million, nuclear €2,763 million, renewable energies €2,162 million.11 Investments related to life insurance policies in 2020:  fossil fuel €8,006 million, nuclear €1,895 million, renewable energies €2,664 million; and in2019: fossil fuel €7,570 million, nuclear €1,987 million, renewable energies €2,100 million12 SME and mid-cap financing activities in 2020:  fossil fuel €114 million, renewable energies €241 million; and in 2019: fossil fuel €65 million, renewableenergies €224 million.7/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021-  The commitment to distribute 50% of net income throughout the Medium-Term Plan will have been met 
despite the regulatory prohibition on distributing dividends for 2019. As a result, in 2021, the dividend is 
set at €1.05 per share, of which €0.20 for the catch-up on the undistributed 2019 dividend (out of €0.40).Moreover, Crédit Agricole SA has demonstrated agility in managing its capital throughout the Medium-Term Plan, 
fully unwinding the switch13, thereby simplifying Crédit Agricole SA’s capital structure, and devoting a total of €4.3 
billion in 2019, 2020 and 2021 to acquisitions14, receiving €2.3 billion over the same period in disposals15, and 
signing eight new strategic partnerships over this period16. The CET1 impact of acquisitions in 2019, 2020 and 
2021, net of the impact of disposals over the same period, is roughly -50 basis points.As part of the medium-term development of its business lines, Crédit Agricole SA also confirmed its European 
ambitions regarding mobility this year, particularly in the specialised financial services business line. In December 
2021, Crédit Agricole and Stellantis announced their intention to join forces in 2023 to create a European leader 
in long-term leasing. CACF would become Stellantis’s exclusive long-term leasing partner, and the purpose of 
the joint venture  would  be  to manage a fleet  of over  one million  vehicles by 2026. This exclusive partnership 
project between CACF and Stellantis would allow CACF to immediately become one of the top five long-term 
leasing players in Europe and offers additional revenue growth potential in a profitable segment from which CACF 
has been largely absent until now. Alongside this partnership, CACF has also announced its intention to develop 
a pan-European multi-brand player in automotive financing, leasing and mobility, based on the expertise of FCA 
Bank and Leasys Rent, which will be wholly owned by CACF in 2023, with a target of €10 billion in outstanding 
by 2026. This new entity would offer white-label products and target manufacturers, dealerships, short-term rental 
companies and independent direct distribution platforms. To that end, CACF acquired a stake in Cosmobilis, the 
leading French automotive distributor in Europe, investing €100 million. Finally, the long-term rental offer of CACF 
and CAL&F for the distribution network of the Group’s retail banks was structured via the creation of CA Mobility, 
a  joint  venture  between  CACF  and  CALF,  with  a  target  of  100,000  vehicles  by  2026.  All  of  these  operations 
support the objective of a 15% RoNE for CACF in 2023,17 with an overall neutral CET1 impact for Crédit Agricole 
SA.13 Full year impact of €104m of the unwinding of the last 50% in Q4-21 (-60bp for CASA CET1)

by  +8.3%  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2020  to  come  in  at  €9,380 million.  On  a  like-for-like  basis19,  underlying 
revenues were up +7.2% from fourth quarter 2020. The Asset gathering division posted a decline in revenues of 
-2.9% (-€48 million) linked to the prudent management of the financial margin and the prudent provisioning of 
technical  risks  in  insurance,  and  despite  dynamic  management  fee  and  commission  income  in  asset 
management, linked to favourable market conditions and dynamic inflows. Revenues for the Large customers 
division were up +8.6% from fourth quarter 2020 (+€123 million), with revenues in capital markets normalising in 
a context of low customer demand. This impact was partially offset by strong growth in structured finance and 
commercial  banking  revenues  and  strong  fee  and  commission  income  from  transactions  in  Asset  servicing. 
Revenues from Specialised financial services grew by +4.9%, with CACF enjoying an increase in commercial 
production  and  insurance  equipment,  and  CALF  from  dynamic  leasing  and  factoring  activity.  In  French  retail 
banking,  the  Regional  Banks  recorded  revenue  growth  of  +6.6%  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2020,  with  LCL 
recording revenue growth of +3.0%. In International retail banking, CA Italia recorded strong revenue growth this 
quarter, mainly due to the effect of the consolidation of Credito Valtellinese since May 2021 (+21.8%). In addition 
to this scope effect, revenues were negatively impacted by the outflow of amounts outstanding (loan disposals) 
and pressure on the interest margin and positively by higher fees on managed savings and amounts outstanding. 
International  retail  banking  outside  Italy  recorded  a  +10.6%  increase  in  revenues,  driven  in  particular  by  the 
dynamic activity of CA Poland and CA Ukraine.Underlying operating expenses excluding the contribution to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) stood at 
€5,812 million in fourth quarter 2021, a year-on-year rise of +4.4%. On a like-for-like basis20, underlying operating 
expenses  excluding  SRF  were  up  +3.0%  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2020.  The  Asset  gathering  division 
experienced an expense decrease of -2.4% due to scope effects (integration of Sabadell AM, creation of Amundi 
Bank  of  China,  Fund  Channel  and  Anatec)  and  accounting  effects  (reclassification  of  La  Médicale  in  IFRS5 
following the signature of the disposal agreement with Generali). Excluding the scope effect, they were up +3.1% 
due notably to continued investments in the development of Amundi Technology. In the Large customers division, 
expenses increased by +5.2%, mainly due to IT investments. Specialised financial services recorded a rise of19 Entities excluded in 2021: Creval, CACF NL, CA Serbie, La Médicale, and, for Amundi, Sabadell AM, Amundi BOC, Fund Channel, Anatec.; Entitiesexcluded / adjusted in 2020:  CA Serbia, La Médicale, CACEIS (proforma consolidation).20 Entities excluded in 2021: Creval, CACF NL, CA Serbie, La Médicale, and, for Amundi, Sabadell AM, Amundi BOC, Fund Channel, Anatec.; Entitiesexcluded / adjusted in 2020:  CA Serbia, La Médicale, CACEIS (proforma consolidation).10/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021+8.9%, in line with activity. The French retail banking division posted a +1.1% rise in expenses from fourth quarter 
2020 to €2,941 million. The International retail banking division posted a +29.7% increase in expenses following 
the integration of Creval, or stable expenses excluding Creval and excluding contribution to the Italian Interbank 
Deposit Protection Fund (FITD).Overall, the Group posted an improved underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF of -2.3 percentage points, 
taking it to 62.0% in fourth quarter 2021.Underlying gross operating income was therefore up +15.4% year-on-year to €3,568 million. On a like-for-like 
basis, gross operating income was up +14.8% from fourth quarter 2020.The underlying cost of credit risk, excluding the impact of the disposal of CA Italia NPL and the complementary 
provisioning of CA Italia outstandings (€319 million) was down to -€464 million (of which -€97 million from the 
cost  of  risk  on  performing  loans  (Stage  1  and  2),  and  -€360 million  from  Stage  3  cost  of  risk)  compared  to  -
€919 million in fourth quarter 2020, i.e. a decrease of -49% compared to fourth quarter 2020. Compared to third 
quarter 2021, when it stood at -€403 million, it was up by +15%.The  decline  in  the  cost  of  risk  this  quarter  was  marked  in  financing  activities  (-90%  where  it  amounted  to  -
€12 million compared to -€121 million in fourth quarter 2020) and at LCL (-39% where it amounted to -€54 million 
compared to -€89 million in fourth quarter 2020).Note that CA Italia’s cost of risk increased by +4% compared to fourth quarter 2020 and +48% compared to third 
quarter  2021  and  amounted  to  -€118 million,  due  to  the  alignment  this  quarter  of  Creval’s  performing  loan 
provisioning models with Crédit Agricole Italia’s practices and to additional provisions linked to NPL disposal.The cost of risk relative to performing loans was down significantly by -85% compared to fourth quarter 2020, a 
trend related to the evolution of the health crisis, this drop was particularly marked at the level of CA Italia (a 
reversal of +€8 million in fourth quarter 2021 compared to a provision of -€22 million in fourth quarter 2020) and 
LCL (a reversal of +€9 million of cost of risk in fourth quarter 2021 compared to a +€60 million provision in fourth 
quarter 2020). The provisioning for proven cost of risk was up moderately by +8% to -€360 million in fourth quarter 
2021 compared to -€334 million in fourth quarter 2020, in particular in retail banking in France (increase of +89% 
and +77% respectively for Regional Banks and LCL due to the transfer to Stage 3 of individual files). In total, the 
cost of risk for 2021 amounted to €1,849 million euros and was down by -49% compared to 2020.The  provisioning  levels  were  determined  this  quarter  taking  into  account  several  weighted  economic 
scenarios. These include a favourable scenario at +6.0% in 2022 and +2.7% in 2023) and a less favourable 
scenario (French GDP at +3.0% in 2022 and +0.9% in 2023). Due to macroeconomic uncertainties that were not 
taken into account in the economic scenarios (changes in the health situation, inflation, interest rate adjustments, 
etc.), an exceptional additional €88 million in provisions on performing and deteriorated loans (cost of risk S1&S2) 
was recorded this quarter in cost of risk (of which €44 million for CIB, €17 million for LCL, €22 million for CACF 
and €5 million for CALF).The cost of risk relative to outstandings21 over four rolling quarters continued to normalise, reaching 18 
basis points (down -20 basis points from fourth quarter 2020 and down -5 basis points from third quarter 2021). 
It also reached 18 basis points on an annualised quarterly basis22 (compared to 37 basis points in fourth 
quarter 2020 and 16 in third quarter 2021).Asset quality remains very satisfactory: the doubtful loan ratio was 2.0% at end December 2021 for the Crédit 
Agricole Group, down 0.3 percentage points compared to December 2020 and 0.2 percentage points compared 
to September 2021; and the coverage ratio improved by +3.6 percentage points compared to December 2020 
and stood at 87.5% at end December 2021. Loan loss reserves amounted to €18.9 billion at end December 2021,21 The cost of risk relative to outstandings (in basis points) on a four quarter rolling basis is calculated on the cost of risk of the past four quartersdivided by the average outstandings at the start of each of the four quarters22 The cost of risk relative to outstandings (in basis points) on an annualised basis is calculated on the cost of risk of the quarter multiplied by four anddivided by the outstandings at the start of the quarter11/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021of  which  39%  related  to  performing  loans  (Stage  1  &  2),  compared  to  29%  at  end  2019,  i.e.  an  increase  of 
€2.0 billion between end 2019 and end 2021.Underlying pre-tax income stood at €3,205 million, a  year-on-year increase of +44.2% compared to fourth 
quarter 2020. In addition to the changes explained above, underlying pre-tax income included the contribution 
from  equity-accounted  entities  in  the  amount  of  €92 million  (up  +25.0%,  driven  by  the  strong  performance  of 
equity-accounted entities at Amundi and CA Consumer Finance) and net income on other assets, which stood at 
€10 million this quarter versus -€26 million in fourth quarter 2020. The underlying tax charge was up +10.8% 
over the period, driven by the increase in underlying pre-tax income and offset by an underlying tax rate of 22.7% 
—  down  from  fourth  quarter  2020  (29.7%).  In  fact,  the  tax  rate  is  never  representative  on  a  quarterly  basis. 
Underlying net income  before  non-controlling interests  was  up  +57.2%  to  €2,503 million.  Non-controlling 
interests rose +17.5%. Lastly, underlying net income Group share was €2,311 million, significantly higher than in 
fourth quarter 2020 (+61.7%).12/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021Crédit Agricole Group – Stated and underlying results, 2021 and 2020€mRevenues2021

and the losses on the wealth management activities in Miami and Brazil held for sale for -€1 million within the 
Wealth management business line.Specific items from 2020 had an impact of -€1,440 million on net income Group share. Compared to specific 
items in fourth quarter 2020 already mentioned above, these items had an impact of -€-541 million on net income 
Group share in the first nine months of 2020 and corresponded to recurring accounting volatility items, i.e. the 
DVA for -€5 million, hedges of the Large customers loan book for +€28 million, changes in the provision for home 
purchase  savings  plans  for  -€134 million,  the  integration/acquisition  costs  of  Kas  Bank  and  S3  by  CACEIS 
for -€6 million, the impact of COVID-19 solidarity donations for -€225 million and reclassifications of held-for-sale 
assets (CACF NL, Bankoa, Romania) for -€170 million.Excluding  these  specific  items,  underlying net  income Group  share  reached  €8,512  million,  up  +38.9% 
compared to 2020.13/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021Underlying revenues were up +7.9% compared to 2020. In addition to a scope effect of €419 million mainly23 
related to the integration of Creval from second quarter 2021 in International retail banking, and to the adjustment 
of  CACF  NL  following  its  exit  from  IFRS  5  status24,  underlying  net  banking  income  grew  by  +8.7%  excluding 
scope effect. This increase in revenues is mainly due to the dynamism of the business lines. More specifically, 
for the Asset gathering division, it was due to dynamic management commission income in asset management, 
which benefited from both a favourable market effect and dynamic inflows, as well as prudent management of 
the financial margin and prudent provisioning of technical risks in Insurance; for the Large customers division, a 
normalisation  of  revenues  in  capital  markets  offset  by  strong  growth  in  revenues  in  structured  finance  and 
commercial  banking,  as  well  as  a  good  level  of  fees  in  asset  servicing,  driven  by  dynamic  activity;  for  the 
Specialised financial services division, dynamic commercial production in consumer credit, growth in insurance 
equipment, and a sustained level of activity in leasing and factoring; for the retail banking division, growth in the 
revenues of the Regional Banks driven by commissions and more favourable refinancing conditions, balanced 
growth in LCL’s revenues between interest margins and fee and commission income, and the dynamism of CA 
Italia’s  fee  and  commission  income.    In  the  Corporate  Centre  division,  revenues  were  up  thanks  to  lower 
refinancing  costs  and  volatility  factors  (such  as  the  impact  of  inflation  on  changes  in  hedging  swaps  and, 
particularly in second and third quarters 2021, eliminations on intra-group securities underwritten by Predica and 
Amundi).Underlying operating expenses excluding SRF increased by +5.1% compared to 2020, and by +3.8% excluding 
scope  effect.  The  increase  in  operating  expenses  both  including  and  excluding  scope  effect  is  less  than  the 
increase  in  revenues  over  full-year  2021,  thus  generating  a  positive  jaw  effect  of  2.8  points  and  2.9  points 
respectively. The cost/income ratio excluding SRF for 2021 is thus 60.6%, down 1.6 percentage points compared 
to  2020.  The  SRF  totalled  €664 million  in  2021,  up  18.2%  compared  to  2020.  Note  that  the  refund  of  an 
overpayment  over  financial  years  2016-2020  was  accounted  for  under  specific  items  in  first  quarter  2020  for 
+€185 million. Underlying gross operating income totalled €13,812 million, up +12.3% compared to 2020.Lastly, cost of risk was down sharply (-49.4%/-€1,802 million, to -€1,849 million versus -€3,651 million in 2020).Regional Banks 
Regional Bank activity was dynamic in 2021, with gross customer capture up sharply (+1,218,000 customers 
since  the  beginning  of  the  year)  and  customer  base  growth  of  an  additional  +226,000  customers.  The 
auto/home/health insurance25 equipment rate also increased (+1 percentage points compared to end December 
2020),  reaching  42.7%  at  end  December  2021.  Mobile  app  use  rates26  reached  71.2%  and  were  up  +3 
percentage points compared to December 2020 (+6.8 percentage points compared to December 2019). Loans 
outstanding reached €596 billion at end December 2021 and increased by +5.8% compared to end December 
2020  (including  +6.5%  for  housing  and  +7.8%  for  corporates). On-balance sheet deposits  rose  significantly 
(+7%  since  end  December  2020),  driven  by  demand  deposits  (+11.0%)  and  passbooks  (+9.8%),  as  did  off-
balance sheet deposits, which were up +4.8% since the same period (of which +3.7% in life insurance). As a 
result, total customer assets increased by +6.2% compared to end December 2020 to reach €839.5 billion at 
end December 2021.In fourth quarter 2021, underlying revenues of the Regional Banks amounted to €3,596 million, a year-on-year 
increase  of  +6.6%.  This  increase  was  driven  by  fee  and  commission  income  (+13.5%),  which  was  dynamic, 
especially in insurance and fee and commission income and account/management payment instruments. Interest

Operating expenses excluding SRF held steady 
at  €2,337 million  in  fourth quarter 2021  (+1.2%  compared  to  fourth quarter 2020).  Accordingly,  there  was  a 
favourable jaws effect (+5.4 percentage points this quarter), and the underlying cost/income ratio excluding 
SRF improved (-3.5 percentage points compared to fourth quarter 2020) to 65.0% that quarter, and the underlying 
gross operating income was up in fourth quarter 2021 by +18.5% compared to fourth quarter 2020. The cost 
of risk amounted to -€130 million27, down -68.7% compared to fourth quarter 2020. The doubtful loan ratio is 
lower (1.6% at end December 2021 compared to 1.7% at end December 2020), and the coverage ratio remained 
high (103.3% at end December 2021 compared to 100.9% at end December 2020). The contribution to taxes 
was up this quarter compared to fourth quarter 2020 (+52%). All in all, the contribution of the Regional Banks to 
underlying net income Group share reached €882 million in fourth quarter 2021, up +87.6% compared to the 
fourth quarter 2020.Over  full-year  2021,  the  Regional Banks’  underlying  revenues  reached  €14,011 million,  increasing  +5.9% 
compared to full-year 2020. Underlying operating expenses excluding SRF increased by +3.3% compared to 
full-year 2020, mainly due to higher employee expenses (notably profit sharing and the exceptional purchasing 
power  bonus).  As  a  result,  there  was  a  positive  jaws  effect  of  2.6  percentage  points  over  the  year,  and  the

-1.3 ppIn fourth quarter 2021, Crédit Agricole S.A.’s stated net income Group share amounted to €1,428 million, a  
multiplication by 11.528, versus €124 million in fourth quarter 2020.The specific items recorded this quarter included recurring volatile accounting items in revenues, such as the 
DVA (Debt Valuation Adjustment, i.e. gains and losses on financial instruments related to changes in the Group’s 
issuer spread) amounting to +€1 million in net income Group share, hedges on the Large customers loan book 
for  €3 million  in  net  income  Group  share  and  provisions  for  home purchase savings  plans  in  the  amount  of

Italia’s results for Creval: finalisation of the recording of net badwill for €90 million in net income Group share, 
recording  of  off-balance  sheet  deferred  tax  assets  for  €80 million  in  net  income  Group  share,  technology 
infrastructure upgrade and IT migration costs for Creval, amounting to -€12 million in net income Group share, 
and other miscellaneous Creval adjustments for -€11 million in net income group share. In addition to these items, 
there were actions to improve the quality of CA Italia’s assets, including the impact of the disposal of a gross 
portfolio of €1.5bn and additional provisions on CA Italia’s portfolio for -€161 million in net income Group share, 
the launch of a Next Generation HR plan for CA Italia and the associated job protection plan for €97 million in net 
income Group share, the exceptional contribution by CA Italia to the Italian banks safeguard plan for -€13 million 
in net income Group share, and the “Affrancamento” gains related to exceptional tax provisions in Italy for the 
non-accounting  revaluation  of  goodwill  and  its  amortisation  for  €45 million  in  net  income  Group  share  for  CA 
Italia. Also recognised as specific items were the Lyxor acquisition costs for -€8 million in net income Group share 
in  asset  management,  transformation  costs  related  to  the  Turbo  project,  the  Caceis  transformation  and 
development plan for -€12 million in net income Group share in Asset servicing, and finally the “Affrancamento” 
gains in Specialised financial services for AGOS for +€66 million in net income Group share.Specific items in fourth quarter 2020 amounted to -€851 million in net income Group share impact and included 
the goodwill impairment of CA Italia, with a negative impact of -€778 million on net income Group share. Also 
included under specific items was the reclassification of entities held for sale (CACF NL, CA Bank Romania) and

income Group share, including on the one hand -€66 million for CACF NL and -€7 million for CA Bank Romania, 
                                                           
28 Variation compared to 2020 stated result which included CA Italia goodwill impairment in 2020.16/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021and, on the other hand, -€23 million for Private banking. Specific items also included exceptional contributions 
related to the COVID-19 crisis: CAA's exceptional contribution for supplementary healthcare contributions in the 
amount of -€15 million in net income Group share and CA Italia's exceptional contribution to the Italian banks 
safeguard plan for -€6 million. Also included under specific items were the reversal of the provision AGCM (Italian 
Competition Authority) addressed to FCA Bank for +€89 million and the impact of the claw-back following the 
activation of Switch 2 (Insurance) for -€26 million in net income Group share. In addition to these items, there 
were recurring accounting volatility items, with a net negative impact of -€16 million in net income Group share, 
namely DVA (Debt Valuation Adjustment, i.e. gains and losses on financial instruments related to changes in the 
Group’s  issuer  spread),  totalling  +€13 million,  the  hedge  on  the  Large customers  loan  book  amounting  to  -
€20 million, and the variation in the provision for home purchase savings plans amounting to -€9 million.Excluding these specific items, the underlying net income Group share29 reached €1,435 million, up sharply 
by +47.2% compared to fourth quarter 2020, thanks in particular to dynamic activity in all businesses, continued 
positive market effects and a reduction in the cost of risk.In fourth quarter 2021, underlying revenues reached €5,779 million, up +9.1% compared to fourth quarter 2020, 
and +7.3% like-for-like30. For the past five years, Crédit Agricole S.A.’s quarterly revenues have been growing 
steadily.Revenues from the Asset gathering division (-3.5% compared to fourth quarter 2020 and -1.2% excluding scope 
effect31)  were  down  despite  dynamic  management  fees  thanks  to  sustained  inflows  and  a  favourable  market 
effect, against a backdrop of prudent provisioning of technical risks and prudent management of the financial 
margin in insurance. Revenues in Large customers were up (+8.6% compared to fourth quarter 2020 and +7.6% 
excluding  scope  effect32),  with  the  normalisation  of  revenues  in  capital  markets  against  a  backdrop  of  weak 
customer demand being offset by strong growth in revenues in structured finance and commercial banking and 
by  higher  fees  in  Asset  servicing  thanks  to  dynamic  activity.  In  the  Specialised  financial  services  division, 
revenues  rose  sharply  (+5.6%  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2020,  +4.6%  excluding  scope  effect33).  CACF’s 
revenues  benefited  from  increased  commercial  production  and  insurance  equipment,  and  from  the  dynamic 
activity in Leasing and Factoring. Retail banking revenues increased (+10.0% compared with fourth quarter 2020, 
and +2.9% excluding scope effect34), driven by fee and commission income at LCL and Crédit Agricole Italia. 
Corporate Centre revenues grew strongly compared to fourth quarter 2020, thanks in particular to the dynamism 
of private equity revenues (CACIF), and to the impact of inflation on the valuation of hedging swaps.Underlying  operating  expenses  excluding  SRF  rose  (+6.7%)  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2020  to 
€3,423 million in fourth quarter 2021. On a like-for-like basis,35 this increase was reduced to +4.3% compared to 
2020, representing an increase in expenses of +€136 million, mainly driven by the following types of expenses: 
investments and IT expenditure, particularly in CIB and Asset management (37% of the increase; approximately 
€50 million), variable compensation and other employee expenses, particularly at LCL and CA Italia (27% of the 
increase;  approximately  €37m),  the  foreign  exchange  impact,  particularly  in  CIB  (13%  of  the  increase; 
approximately €18 million), taxes, particularly at CA Italia (10% of the increase; approximately €14 million), and 
other miscellaneous expenses consisting of taxes, external expenses and marketing campaigns, particularly at 
CACF and LCL (8% of the increase; approximately €17 million). The cost/income ratio36 excluding SRF was low 
at 59.2%, an improvement (-1.3 percentage points) compared to fourth quarter 2020. The Medium-Term Plan 
targets were already reached in Asset gathering (MTP target <48%; Q4-21 at 44.6%; 12M-21 at 45.8%), Large29 Underlying, excluding specific items. See Appendixes for more details on specific items.

SRF17/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021customers (MTP target <57%; Q4-21 at 60.9%; 12M-21 at 57.8%) and LCL (MTP target <66%; Q4-21 at 64.9%; 
12M-21 at 62.2%). On a like-for-like basis and35 at current scope, Crédit Agricole SA recorded a positive jaws 
effect of +3.0 percentage points and +2.4 percentage points respectively in fourth quarter 2021. Within the Asset 
gathering division, operating expenses excluding SRF were down -2.5% at current scope and up +3.5% like-for-
like37, linked to the increase in expenses in asset management (+4.4% compared to fourth quarter 2020 at current 
scope  and  +2.4%  like-for-like38),  which  includes  continued  development  investments,  particularly  in  Amundi 
Technology, and in the insurance business line (-25.6% compared to fourth quarter 2020 at current scope and 
+1.4%  like-for-like39).  In  the  Large  customers  division,  operating  expenses  excluding  SRF  were  up  +5.2% 
compared  to  fourth  quarter  2020  at  current  scope  and  +3.6%  like-for-like40,  mainly  due  to  IT  investments  in 
Corporate  and  Investment  Banking.  The  Specialised  financial  services  division  saw  its  expenses  increase  by 
+10.3% compared to fourth quarter 2020 at current scope and by +8.3% like-for-like41, in line with the increase 
in activity. Retail banking’s operating expenses, excluding SRF, were up 13.8% compared to fourth quarter 2020 
at current scope and up 4.4% like-for-like42. The increase was contained at LCL (+0.7% compared with fourth 
quarter 2020) and more marked at CA Italia (+7.2% like-for-like43 compared to fourth quarter 2020), but stable 
(+0.7%)  excluding  the  contribution  to  the  Italian  guarantee  deposit  fund  (FITD).  Corporate  Centre  expenses 
decreased by €9 million compared to fourth quarter 2020.Underlying  gross  operating  income  thus  rose  to  €2,356 million,  a  +12.7%  increase  compared  to 
fourth quarter 2021.  Excluding  scope  effect,35  the  increase  was  +11.8%,  demonstrating  the  strength  of  the 
Universal Customer-focused Banking model with steady revenue growth and continuously improving operating 
efficiency over the past five years. By business line, gross operating income grew compared to fourth quarter 
2020 like-for-like in Large customers (+14.3%), Specialised Financial Services (+1.0%), and French retail banking 
(+7.5%). The Asset gathering (-4.6%) and International retail banking (-9.5%) divisions saw a decline.The  provisioning  levels  were  determined  this  quarter  taking  into  account  several  weighted  economic 
scenarios. These include a favourable scenario (French GDP at +6.0% in 2022 and +2.7% in 2023) and a less 
favourable scenario (French GDP at +3.0% in 2022 and +0.9% in 2023). Due to various uncertainties that were 
not  taken  into  account  in  the  economic  scenarios  (changes  in  the  health  situation,  inflation,  interest  rate 
adjustments, etc.), an exceptional additional €88 million in provisions on performing and deteriorated loans (cost 
of  risk  S1&S2)  was  recorded  this  quarter  in  cost  of  risk  (of  which  €44 million  for  CIB,  €17 million  for  LCL, 
€22 million for CACF and €5 million for CALF).The cost of risk was down by -35% compared to fourth quarter 2020 and up by +23% compared to third quarter 
2021.  It  amounted  to  -€328 million  versus  -€500 million  in  fourth  quarter  2020  and  -€266 million  in 
third quarter 2021  respectively.  It  is  composed  of  the  provisioning  for  performing  loans  (Stages  1&2)  for  -
€20 million (versus an addition of -€193 million in fourth quarter 2020 and -€27 million in third quarter 2021) and 
the  provisioning  for  proven  risks  (Stage 3)  for  -€277 million (versus  -€291 million  in  fourth  quarter  2020  and  -
€234 million  in  third quarter 2021).  The  cost  of  credit  risk  relative  to  outstandings  over  a  rolling  four-quarter 
period44 was 28 basis points (down -34 bp compared to fourth quarter 2020 and down -5 bp compared to third 
quarter 2021) and 29 basis points on an annualised quarterly basis45 (down -18 bp compared to fourth quarter 
2020 and up +5 bp compared to third quarter 2021).37 Entities excluded in 2021: La Médicale, Sabadell AM, Amundi BOC, Fund Channel, Anatec; Entities excluded / adjusted in 2020: La Médicale.

Crédit Agricole S.A.’s  assets and risk  coverage level.  The  diversified  loan  book  is mainly  geared  towards 
home loans (27% of gross outstandings) and corporates (45% of Crédit Agricole S.A. gross outstandings). The 
doubtful  loan  ratio  was  still  low  at  2.5%  (down  -0.7  percentage  point  compared  to  December  2020),  and  the 
coverage ratio46 was high, at 74.7% and up +3.2 percentage points compared to fourth quarter 2020. Total loan 
loss reserves amounted to €8.9 billion for Crédit Agricole SA at end December 2021 (up €0.7 billion compared 
to end December 2020), of which 34% relate to performing loans (Stage 1 & 2), compared to 22% at end 2019, 
an increase of €1.0 billion between end 2019 and end 2021.By business line, this quarter saw the decrease of the NPL rate for CA Italia, which amounted to 3.7% at end 
December 2021 versus 6.5% at end December 2020. This decrease was due to the disposal of doubtful loans, 
mainly in the historical scope of CA Italia. CA Italia’s coverage ratio increased to 62.0% at end December 2021 
from 60.8% at end December 2020.The  underlying  contribution  of  equity-accounted  entities  amounted  to  €82 million,  up  +73.9%  compared  to 
fourth  quarter  2020,  reflecting  the  good  activity  within  entities  of  consumer  finance  (€67 million,  up  +33.4% 
compared  to  fourth  quarter  2020)  and  asset  management  (€21 million,  up  +4.7%  compared  to  fourth  quarter 
2020).Net income on other assets stood at -€9 million in fourth quarter 2021, stable by comparison at -€9 million in 
fourth quarter 2020.Underlying  income47  before  tax,  discontinued  operations  and  non-controlling  interests  was  therefore  up 
+29.0%, at €2,100 million. The underlying effective tax rate stood at 22.4%(-7.2 percentage points compared 
to fourth quarter 2020),  while the underlying tax charge increased -3.5% to -€453 million. Net income before 
non-controlling interests was up by +42.4%.Non-controlling  interests  stood  at  -€216 million  in  fourth  quarter  2021,  a  +16.9%  increase,  in  line  with  the 
results of the businesses and due to a change in third quarter 2020 in Insurance in the recognition methods used 
for subordinated debt (RT1) coupons, without impact on net earnings per share.Underlying net income Group share was up by +47.2% compared to fourth quarter 2020 at €1,435 million.Underlying  earnings  per  share  in  fourth  quarter 2021  reached  €0.46,  increasing  by  +48.2%  compared  to 
fourth quarter 2020.The capital position was very strong with Crédit Agricole SA’s phased-in CET1 ratio at 11.9% (11.6% fully 
loaded), 4.0 percentage points above SREP. It includes a retained dividend provision of €1.05 per share for the

i.e. a rise by a factor of 2.2 in stated net income Group share.Specific items in full year 2021 had a positive impact of +€447 million on stated net income Group share. In 
addition to the fourth quarter items already mentioned above, the items from the first nine months of 2021 had a 
positive  impact  of  +€454 million  in  net  income  Group  share  and  also  corresponded  to  recurring  accounting 
volatility items, i.e. the DVA for +€4 million, hedges of the Large customers loan book for -€15 million, changes 
in provisions for home purchase savings plans for -€7 million, and the overpayment of contributions to the SRF 
for financial years 2016 to 2020 for +€130 million. In addition to these recurring items, the following specific items 
for  the  first  nine  months  of  2021  were  included:  the  recording  of  a  provisional  net  badwill  for  Creval  for 
+€285 million  in  net  income  Group  share,  Affrancamento  gains  within  the  Asset  gathering,  International  retail 
banking and Specialised financial services business lines for a total of +€106 million, an additional provisioning

Additional Tier 1 coupons (return on equity Group share excluding intangibles) reached 13.1% for full-year 2021, 
an increase from full-year 2020 (9.3%). RoNE (Return on Net Equity) increased this year compared to 2020, in 
line with the increasing results.49 See details on the calculation of the business lines’ ROTE (return on tangible equity) and RONE (return on normalised equity) on p. 5820/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021Underlying revenues were up +9.1% compared to 2020. In addition to a scope effect of +€419 million mainly50 
driven  by  the  integration  of  Creval  from  second  quarter  2021  in  International  Retail  Banking,  and  to  the 
reintegration of CACF NL following its exit from IFRS 5 status51, underlying revenues grew by +7.1% like-for-like. 
The increase in revenues was also due to the dynamism of the business lines. For the Asset gathering division, 
dynamic management fee and commission income benefited from both a favourable market effect and a dynamic 
inflow of funds, and the change in insurance revenues reflected prudent management of the financial margin and 
prudent provisioning of technical risks. In the Large customers division, revenues in capital markets normalised 
against  a  backdrop  of  weak  customer  demand,  while  revenues  grew  strongly  in  structured  finance  and 
commercial  banking.  Fees  and  commissions  were  up  in  Asset  servicing,  thanks  to  dynamic  activity.  In  the 
Specialised  financial  services  division,  consumer  finance  revenues  were  supported  by  dynamic  commercial 
production and insurance equipment, and the level of activity in leasing and factoring was sustained. In Retail 
banking, revenues grew by +4.5% at LCL, balanced between interest margins and fee and commission income, 
and fee and commission income grew at CA Italia. In the Corporate Centre division, revenues were up thanks to 
lower refinancing costs and volatility factors (such as the impact of inflation on the valuation of hedging swaps 
and, in particular in the second and third quarters of 2021, eliminations on intra-group securities underwritten by 
Predica and Amundi).Underlying operating expenses excluding SRF were up by 5.8% in 2021, also including a scope effect (+€281 
million52).  On  a  like-for-like  basis,  costs  grew  by  3.5%  in  2021,  driven  by  all  business  lines:  Asset  gathering 
(+5.9%53), Large customers (+4.1%54), Specialised financial services (5.8%55), and Retail banking (+1.4%56). At 
a current scope and on a like-for-like basis, revenue growth in 2021 was higher than cost growth, generating a 
positive jaws effect of 3.3 points and 3.6 points respectively. The underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF for 
2021 was 57.8%, down -1.8 percentage points compared to 2020. The SRF for 2021 totalled €522 million, up 
18.9% compared to first half 2020. Note that the refund of an overpayment over financial years 2016–2021 was 
accounted  for  €130  million  under  specific  items  in  the  first  quarter  2020.  Underlying  gross  operating  income 
totalled €9,047 million, up +13.7% compared to 2020.Lastly, cost of risk was down sharply (-53%/-€1,375 million), to -€1,232 million versus -€2,606 million in 2020.The decrease was pronounced at the level of the provisions for performing loans (Stage 1 and 2) at -81%, and 
was  due  to  a  normalisation  of  the  cost  of  risk  throughout  2021  due  to  the  decrease  in  uncertainties  and  the 
favourable evolution of the health situation, as shown by the improvement of the macro-economic scenario in 
Q4-21.The addition of -€1,232 million in cost of risk over the year 2021 is composed into provisions for performing loans 
(Stage 1 and 2) for -€155 million (compared to an addition of -€817 million in 2020) and provisioning for proven 
risks (Stage 3) for -€993 million (compared to -€1,765 million in 2020).The decline in the cost of risk is noticeable in all of Crédit Agricole S.A.’s business lines. LCL’s cost of risk is -
€222 million in 2021, down -43% compared to 2020, with a cost of risk on rolling outstandings of 15 basis points 
at the end of December 2021; CA Italia’s cost of risk was -€347 million in 2021, down -19% compared to 2020, 
with a cost of risk on rolling outstandings of 63 basis points at the end of December 2021; CACF’s cost of risk is 
-€445 million in 2021, down -30% compared to 2020, with a cost of risk on outstandings of 128 basis points at 
the end of December 2021; finally, in Financing activities, the cost of risk for 2021 is -€74 million, down -91% 
compared to 2020, with a cost of risk on rolling outstandings of 6 basis points at the end of December 2021.50 Other entities with scope effects: CA Serbia, Amundi BOC, Fund Channel, Anatec, So you, Kas Bank, La Médicale

Financial Services partnerships being the main contributors.Net income on other assets stood at -€36 million in 2021 compared to +€75 million in 2020. This contribution 
was mainly from the deconsolidation of CACIB’s Algerian subsidiary.Underlying income before tax, discontinued operations and non-controlling interests was therefore up 
+41.7%, at €8,148 million.The  tax  charge  was  €1,876  million,  up  +53.2%,  with  an  underlying  effective  tax  rate  of  24.1%,  up  +1.6

income before tax, discontinued operations and non-controlling interests. Underlying net income Group share 
increased by +40.1% to €5,394 million.22/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021Analysis of the activity and the results of Crédit Agricole 
S.A.’s divisions and business linesAsset gathering 
The business line’s assets under management stood at €2,582 billion at the end of December 2021, up 11.3% 
from end September 2020. Of the increase of €261 billion compared to the  end  of September 2021,  +€147.9 
billion were related to a scope effect (of which +€148 billion were related to the consolidation of Lyxor assets 
following the completion of the acquisition announced on 31 December 2021, and -€0.1 billion due to the exit of 
the Miami and Brazil activities in Wealth management), net inflows increased by +€69.0 billion, of which +€65.6 
billion in Asset management, +€2.3 billion in Life insurance, and +€1.1 billion in Wealth management, and market 
and foreign exchange impact accounted for an increase of +€44.5 billion. Excluding scope effect, assets under 
management were up 4.9% from end September 2021 and 9.7% from end December 2020.In savings/retirement, activity was dynamic and Crédit Agricole Assurances continued its commercial expansion 
and diversification in France and internationally. Premium income was up by +23.0% compared to fourth quarter 
2020. Net inflows in fourth quarter 2021 were positive (+€2.3 billion), with positive net inflows in euros contracts 
(+€0.3 billion). Net UL inflows totalled €2.0 billion (i.e. an increase of +57.8% from fourth quarter 2020). The share 
of unit linked products in total gross inflows hit a level of 42.0%, this quarter, i.e. +5.8 percentage points compared 
to fourth quarter 2020.Assets (savings, retirement and death and disability) stood at €323.0 billion, up +4.8% from December 2020 and 
up +1.5% from September 2021. Unit-linked outstandings reached a new all-time high of €86.6 billion this quarter, 
with the share of unit-linked products in outstandings totalling 26.8%, up +2.6 percentage points compared with 
December 2020.Lastly, the Policy Participation Reserve (PPE57) increased over the year to €13.1 billion at 31 December 2021, 
which was 6.3% of total euro outstandings. The average yield58 of the Crédit Agricole Assurances group’s assets 
was 2.26% in 2021 (2.13% at end 2020), well above even the average guaranteed minimum rate (0.16% at end 
2021, compared to 0.20%59 at end 2020) and the profit sharing rate of euro-denominated policies of 1.28% at the 
end of 2021, stable compared to the end of 2020.In  property  and  casualty  insurance,  business  was  strong  in  fourth  quarter  2021,  with  growth  of  +5.1%  in 
premium income compared to fourth quarter 2020. The number of property and casualty insurance policies in the 
Crédit Agricole Assurances portfolio reached 15.2 million at end December 2021, up +3.9% over one year, i.e. 
an increase of more than 568,000 policies in the twelve months of 2021. Growth in the property and casualty 
insurance business was driven by traditional activities (home, legal protection, personal accident insurance, car) 
and was also boosted by launches, in France, of corporate offerings (corporate property and casualty insurance 
and professional multi-risk) and a new auto insurance policy with an inclusive offer, EKO for the Regional Banks 
and  PRIMO  for  LCL.  Finally,  on  1  January  2022,  the  transfer  of  10  million  assistance  contracts  to  Europ 
Assistance France was successfully completed. The combined ratio60 remained under control at 96.4%.In death & disability/creditor/group insurance, premium income stood at €1.2 billion, an increase of +7.7% 
this quarter compared to fourth quarter 2020, with a positive contribution from the three business lines (death & 
disability, creditor and group insurance). The performance of the new "Mon Assurance Décès" death & disability 
insurance offer was good, with over 100,000 new policies since end June 2021.57 Scope “Life France”

La Médicale, which resulted in its accounting being reclassified under IFRS 5 in the fourth quarter of 2021. The 
positive impact on Crédit Agricole Assurances’ net income Group share at the time of the sale, expected by the 
end of 2022, will be more than €100 million.Asset Management (Amundi) recorded a 14.0% increase in assets under management this quarter compared 
to end September 2021 (+19.4% year-on-year since end December 2020), i.e. €2,064 billion at end December 
2021. The increase was mainly due to the consolidation of Lyxor assets (+€148 billion), positive market effects 
(+€39.1 billion) and strong net inflows in all customer segments (+€65.6 billion).Over  the  year  2021,  net  MLT  inflows  excluding  JVs  reached  a  record  level  of  €75.5  billion,  driven  by  active 
management. In fourth quarter 2021, Amundi posted net MLT inflows excluding joint ventures of +€29.0 billion, 
driven by active management (+€20.0 billion). The good level of activity in Retail continued, with net MLT inflows 
excluding JVs in this customer segment standing at +€16.3 billion. The Institutional segment also recorded solid 
MLT inflows at €12.7 billion. Treasury products recorded sustained net inflows of +€11.1 billion in both customer 
segments. Inflows in joint ventures were positive at +€25.5 billion, driven by China and India.Excluding the scope effect related to the consolidation of Lyxor assets as at 31 December 2021, assets under 
management  were  up  +5.8%  compared  to  end  September  2021  (+10.8%  year-on-year  since  end  December 
2020). In Asia, continued development enabled the level of assets under management to reach €369 billion at 
end December 2021, compared to €298 billion at end December 2020, with a target of €500 billion by 2025.In addition, following the completion of Amundi’s acquisition of Lyxor from Société Générale on 31 December 
2021, Amundi has set a passive asset management target of around €420 billion by 2025.In Wealth management, assets under management grew during the quarter to €135 billion at end December 
2021, an increase of +2.7%61 excluding the scope effect over the quarter since end September 2021 (+2.6% at 
current scope) and an increase of +7.9%61 over one year excluding the scope effect (+5.2% at current scope), 
driven in particular by strong net inflows, which amounted to +€1.1 billion in fourth quarter 2021.The Asset gathering (AG) business line posted underlying net income Group share of €610 million in fourth 
quarter 2021, up +18.8% from fourth quarter 2020, driven by growth in the contribution of all businesses.The Asset Gathering (AG) business line posted underlying net income Group share of €2,348 million in 2021, up 
+24.9% from 2020.The business line contributed by 40% to the underlying net income Group share of the Crédit Agricole S.A. core 
businesses  (excluding  Corporate  Centre  division)  over  2021  and  29%  of  the  underlying  revenues  of  Crédit 
Agricole S.A.’s business lines. (excluding the Corporate Centre division).As  at  31  December  2021,  own  funds  allocated  to  the  business  line  amounted  to  €12.9 billion,  including 
€11.2 billion  for  Insurance,  €1.2 billion  for  Asset  management,  and  €0.4 billion  for  Wealth  management.  The 
business line’s risk weighted assets amounted to €64.3 billion, including €46.7 billion for Insurance, €12.9 billion 
for Asset management and €4.7 billion for Wealth management.The underlying RoNE (Return on Normalised Equity) stand at 24.4% for full year 2021, versus 22.5% for full year 
2020.61Excluding the scope effect related to the exit of the Miami and Brazil activities24/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021InsuranceUnderlying revenues for the insurance activity stood at €602 million in fourth quarter 2021, down -18.0%62 over 
one year. The quarter’s buoyant financial revenues combined with a low level of corporate income tax enabled 
Crédit  Agricole  Assurances  to  pursue  a  prudent  policy  of managing  its  financial margin  and  to  make  prudent 
provisions for technical risks. Compared to fourth quarter 2020, insurance revenues nevertheless benefited from 
€30 million related to the unwinding of the remaining 65% of the Switch mechanism implemented by 15% on 1 
March 2021 and by 50% on 16 November 2021. Underlying expenses were down -25.6%62 in fourth quarter 2021 
compared to fourth quarter 2020. Excluding taxes, the reduction in expenses was -24.7%63 due to investments 
for the development of the activity and the increase in staff costs. As a result, underlying gross operating income 
was down -15.6% to €469 million in fourth quarter 2021. The underlying cost/income ratio in fourth quarter 2021 
stood at 22.2%, a decrease of -2.2 percentage points compared to fourth quarter 2020. The tax charge decreased 
by -61.4% to €79 million compared to fourth quarter 2020 which included non-deductible additions to provisions. 
The underlying net income Group share showed an increase of +16.0%, taking into account in non-controlling 
interests the change in the recognition methods used for RT1 subordinated debt coupons (-€19 million in accrued 
interest, with no impact on net earnings per share).Underlying revenues for the year 2021 reached €2,550 million, down slightly by -0.2%62, as a result of a prudent 
policy of managing the financial margin, which enabled the PPE to be endowed with +€1.6 billion in 2021. Costs 
decreased  by  -5.2%62,  resulting  in  an  improvement  in  the  cost/income  ratio  excluding  SRF  of  1.5 percentage 
points, which thus reached 28.3% in 2021. Underlying gross operating income thus increased by +1.9%. Finally, 
the  tax  charge  for  the  year  2021  decreased  by  -32.2%  compared  to  2020,  due  to  a  base  effect  in  2020,  the 
decrease in the normative tax rate in France, and the reduced-tax disposal of securities in 2021. As a result, net 
income Group share reached €1,406 million, a sharp increase of +16.5% compared to 2020.Crédit Agricole Assurances also demonstrated its solidity and resilience with a Solvency 2 regulatory prudential 
ratio still high at 244% at 31 December 2021.Asset managementUnderlying revenues totalled €777 million in fourth quarter 2021, up +9.1% from fourth quarter 2020 at current 
scope  and  +8.0%  on  a  like-for-like  basis64.  Net  management  revenues  were  up  +10.3%  compared  to  fourth 
quarter 2020, driven by net management fees, which rose by +15.7%, benefiting from the strong inflow of funds 
into active management. Performance fees began to normalise, amounting to €70 million in fourth quarter 2021 
(after  €90  million  in  third  quarter  2021).  Underlying  operating  expenses  amounted  to  €395  million,  up  +4.4% 
compared to fourth quarter 2020 at current scope and +2.4% on a like-for-like basis64. This increase, which was 
kept under control, can be explained by continued investment in development, particularly at Amundi Technology. 
Underlying gross operating income was thus up a +14.3% and the underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF 
stood  at  50.9%,  down  -2.3 percentage  points  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2020.  The  contribution  of  equity-
accounted  entities,  comprising  in  particular  income  from  Amundi’s  joint  ventures  in  Asia,  was  up  +4.7%  from 
fourth  quarter  2020  and  totalled  €21 million.  The  underlying  tax  charge  worked  out  at  €92 million,  a  +9.3% 
increase. Lastly, underlying net income Group share was up by +16.2% to €210 million.In 2021, underlying revenues increased by +24.3% at current scope and +22.3% on a like-for-like basis65 due to 
positive  market  conditions,  net  management  fees  which  increased  by  +14.5%  compared  to  2020,  and 
performance fees which amounted to +€427 million for the year compared to €200 million in 2020. Underlying 
operating expenses excluding SRF were up +14.2% at current scope and +11.0% on a like-for-like basis65 due 
to the increase in variable compensation, higher development capex, mostly for Amundi Technology, and a scope 
effect of €44 million over the year.

increased by +27.7%. Lastly, net income Group share for 2021 reached a record level of €839 million, up +39.7%.Wealth managementUnderlying revenues were strong at €229 million in fourth quarter 2021, up +4.4% compared to fourth quarter 
2020.  Underlying  expenses  excluding  SFR  rose,  albeit  under  control  (+6.1%)  despite  IT  investments,  and 
reached €188 million. Accordingly, underlying gross operating income fell slightly year-on-year by -2.7% while 
the underlying cost/income ratio excluding the SRF stood at 82.0% in fourth quarter 2021. The cost of risk fell 
sharply  to  €0.03  million  in  fourth  quarter  2021  compared  to  €21  million  in  fourth  quarter  2020.  As  a  result, 
underlying  net  income  Group  share  was  up  sharply,  increasing  by  a  factor  of  2.1  compared  to  fourth  quarter 
2020, reaching €32 million in fourth quarter 2021.In 2021, underlying revenues were up +2.6% compared to 2020. Costs excluding SRF were up +0.9%. Gross 
operating income was therefore up +12.7% to €134 million. After cost of risk (€5 million over the year) tax and 
non-controlling interests, net income Group share thus improved by +43.9% to reach €103 million over the full 
year.  Note  that  the  recognition  this  year  of  -€1 million  in  revenues,  -€2 million  in  costs  and  €5 million  from 
discontinued operations, representing a total net impact after tax of €2 million in specific items this half had an 
impact on net income Group share. These gains are related to the contribution of the Miami and Brazil entities 
that are held for sale.Large customers 
Activity for the  whole Corporate and Investment banking (CIB) business line  was buoyant in fourth quarter 
2021, thanks in particular to a good performance in Financing activities, and despite the normalisation of revenues 
in capital markets, in a context of weak customer demand. Underlying revenues thus remain high at €1,251 
million (i.e. +8.1% compared to fourth quarter 2020). Financing activities performed very well, with revenues at 
€750 million, up significantly by +22.5% in fourth quarter 2021 compared to fourth quarter 2020 and by +19.3% 
at constant exchange rates. This very good revenue level was also driven by Structured Finance activity (+24.3% 
versus fourth quarter 2020) and Commercial Banking (+20.9% versus fourth quarter 2020), in particular thanks 
to  the  continued  strong  development  of  International  Trade  &  Transaction  Banking  (ITB).  Crédit  Agricole  CIB 
remains  the  leader  in  syndicated  loans  (#  3  in  the  EMEA66  zone  and  #  1  in  France67). Capital markets  and 
investment banking revenues amounted to €501 million, down -8.0% compared to fourth quarter 2020 and -
10.1% at constant exchange rates, due to the slowdown in FICC activities (-11.8% compared to fourth quarter 
2020) penalised by a low level of customer demand, partially offset by the Securitisation activity and by strong 
activity  in  Investment  banking  (+15.1%  in  fourth  quarter  2021  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2020).  Regulatory 
average VaR was also down to €6.4 million in fourth quarter 2021, compared to €10.9 million in fourth quarter 
2020. In a normalising market, Credit Agricole CIB confirmed its leading positions in bond issuances (#4 in Green, 
Social & Sustainable bonds All currencies68, #5 in All bonds in Euro worldwide69 and #8 in All Corporate bonds 
in Euro worldwide70 ).Asset  servicing  (CACEIS)  recorded  a  good  level  of  activity  in  fourth  quarter  2021.  Assets  under  custody 
recorded strong momentum, totalling €4,581 billion at end December 2021, up +9.1% from end December 2020.

71 10.1% growth in assets under management, adjusted for the effect of the consolidation of CACEIS Fund Services26/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021end December 2021. This upward trend can be explained by both a volume effect and a positive market effect. 
Transaction flows were also dynamic.In fourth quarter 2021, underlying revenues of the Large customers division reached €1,562 million, up +8.6% 
compared to fourth quarter 2020, driven by strong activity. Underlying operating expenses excluding SRF 
amounted to €952 million, up +5.2% compared to fourth quarter 2020, mainly due to IT investments in Corporate 
and Investment banking. There was therefore a positive jaws effect on Corporate and Investment banking (+3.3 
percentage points). It also applies for Asset Servicing (+4.1 percentage points). The underlying cost/income ratio 
excluding  SRF  of  the  Large  Customers  division  stood  at  60.9%,  an  improvement  of  2.0 percentage points 
compared to fourth quarter 2020. Thus, gross operating income increased by +14.3%. The division recorded an 
overall net provision for cost of risk of -€1 million in fourth quarter 2021, compared to a provision of -€111 million 
in fourth quarter 2020. Pre-tax income was up sharply by +43.8% in fourth quarter 2021 versus fourth quarter 
2020, to reach €611 million. The tax charge amounted to -€163 million, multiplied by 2.6 over the same period, 
mainly  due  to  a  tax  base  effect  (linked  to  the  increase  in  the  taxable  base  under  the  effect  of  the  growth  in 
revenues  and  the  sharp  drop  in  the  cost  of  risk)  and  to  a  different  breakdown  of  pre-tax  profits  by  country. 
Consequently, net income Group share rose by +23.5% in fourth quarter 2021 to stand at €418 million.For 2021, the underlying revenues of the Large customers division amounted to €6,331 million, an increase of 
+0.9% compared to 2020, against a normalisation backdrop of revenues in capital markets throughout the year 
and very strong activity in financing activities. Operating expenses excluding SRF increased to €3,658 million, 
up +4.4% compared to 2020, in support of the development of the business lines. Costs related to SRF were 
€328 million,  up  +26.2%  compared  to 2020.  Therefore,  gross  operating  income  amounted  €2,345  million  for 
2021,  representing  a  decrease  of  -6.6%  compared  to  2020.  The  cost/income  ratio  excluding  SRF  was  up 
1.9 percentage point compared to 2020, but remained low at 57.8%. The cost of risk decreased in 2021, with a 
net provision of -€39 million compared to a provision of -€829 million in 2020, in the context of the health crisis. 
The  business  line’s  contribution  to  underlying  net  income  Group  share  was  at  €1,644 million,  up  +24.0% 
compared to 2020.The  business  line  contributed  28%  to  the underlying net income  Group  share  of  Crédit Agricole S.A.'s  core 
businesses (excluding the Corporate Centre division) over 2021 and 28% to underlying revenues excluding the 
Corporate Centre division.At 31 December 2021, the capital allocated to the division business line was €12.6 billion and risk weighted 
assets were €132.2 billion.The business line’s underlying RoNE (Return on Normalised Equity) stood at 13.1% for the full year 2021 (versus 
10.7% for 2020).27/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021Corporate and Investment bankingIn  fourth  quarter  2021,  the  underlying  revenues  of  Corporate  and  Investment  banking  amounted  to  €1,251 
million, up +8.1% compared to fourth quarter 2020, thanks to the complementary nature of its business model. 
Financing activities registered a strong level of revenues (at €750 million, up +22.5% compared to fourth quarter 
2020),  while  revenues  in  capital  markets  were  normalising  (at  €501  million,  down  -8.0%  compared  to  fourth 
quarter 2020), against a backdrop of lower customer demand. Underlying operating expenses excluding SRF 
were  up  +4.8%  this  quarter  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2020  to  stand  at  -€720 million.  This  was  related  to 
investments in IT projects to support business growth. The cost/income ratio excluding SRF rose to 57.5%, an 
improvement of 1.8 percentage point compared to fourth quarter 2020.  As a result, gross operating income 
amounted to €531 million, up +12.9% compared to fourth quarter 2020. The cost of risk recorded a net provision 
of -€2 million compared to a provision of -€108 million in fourth quarter 2020. This decrease in provisions was 
mainly due to lower provisioning for performing loans in Financing activities (Stages 1 & 2 net provision of €5 
million  in  fourth  quarter  2021  against  provisions  for  -€52  million  in  fourth  quarter  2020),  notably  due  to  the 
improvement in the medium-term economic forecasts. Lastly, pre-tax income in fourth quarter 2021 stood at 
€530 million, up +46.2%. The tax charge amounted to -€148 million, multiplied by 2.8 compared to fourth quarter 
2020 due to the significant increase in the taxable base (increase in revenues and the sharp drop in the cost of 
risk) and a different breakdown of pre-tax profits by country). In the end, the underlying net income Group share 
of Corporate and Investment banking amounted to €373 million in fourth quarter 2021, up +23.1% compared to 
fourth quarter of 2020.Risk weighted assets at the end of December 2021 amounted to €122.9 billion, down by -€0.3 billion compared 
to the end of September 2021.The underlying revenues of Corporate and Investment banking for 2021 increased slightly by +0.1% (up +0.9% 
at constant exchange rates) compared to 2020 to reach -€5,152 million. The positive performance of financing 
activities (+9.2% compared to 2020), notably for structured financing activities (+12.0% compared to 2020) offset 
the decline in capital markets and investment banking revenues (-8.8% compared to 2020) in a context of lower 
customer demand. Underlying costs excluding SRF increased by +4.6%, linked to the impact of strong activity 
on remuneration, and IT investments, while the contribution to the SFR recorded a significant increase of +27.3% 
in  2021  compared  to  2020,  to  reach  €295  million.  Therefore,  underlying  gross  operating  income  at  €2,085 
million  was down (-8.0% compared to 2020), but the level  of the underlying cost/income ratio remained  low 
(53.8% versus 51.5% in 2020). Finally, the cost of risk recorded a provision of -€47 million for 2021, compared 
to -€824 million for 2020. All in all, the business line’s contribution to underlying net income Group share rose 
sharply by +25.6% to €1,501 million.28/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021Asset servicingIn  fourth  quarter  2021,  underlying  revenues  recorded  the  best  performance  of  the  year,  amounting  to  €311 
million, up +10.6%72 compared to fourth quarter 2020. Business was strong, with assets under custody increasing 
by +9.1% over the year, assets under administration by +10.6%73 and flow activities remaining at a high level. 
The increase in revenues was driven by higher fee and commission income on flows and a positive market effect. 
Underlying  operating  expenses  excluding  SRF  and  costs  related  to  the  Turbo  project74  increased  (+6.5%) 
compared  to  fourth  quarter  2020,  coming  in  at  €232 million75.  Underlying  gross  operating  income  thus 
increased substantially, rising +24.9% to €79 million. The underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF stood at 
74.7% in fourth quarter 2021, down -2.9 percentage points compared to fourth quarter 2020. After the €21 million 
share of non-controlling interests, the business line’s contribution to underlying net income Group share rose 
+27.2% compared to fourth quarter 2020 to €45 million.Underlying revenues for 2021 were up +4.5%76 compared to 2020, driven by good fee and commission income 
and despite pressure on the interest margin in the first half of 2021. Underlying expenses excluding SRF were 
up +3.7%77, driven by the growth in business and the recognition of KAS Bank’s residual integration costs during 
second quarter 2021, whereas SRF expenses were up sharply by +16.6%. Thus, underlying gross operating 
income was up 5.9% compared to 2020. The underlying cost/income ratio was down slightly by 0.6 percentage 
point, reaching 75.1% in 2021. In the end, the contribution of the business line to net income Group share in 
2021 was €143 million, representing a 9.4% increase compared to 31 December 2020.Specialised financial services  
The Specialised financial services business line recorded a strong performance across all businesses this 
quarter. Commercial production was indeed strong in consumer finance, as well as in leasing and factoring.In addition, this quarter was marked by the announcement of several initiatives that will lead to future growth for 
the Group:  the announcement of the creation,  in 2023  by  CACF  and Stellantis as a 50%/50% JV,  of a  pan-
European multi-brand leader in long-term rentals, serving all Stellantis brands. The objective is to reach a fleet 
of one million vehicles by 2026. CACF has also announced its intention to expand in Europe in the area of car 
financing, via FCA Bank, which will be wholly owned by 2023. This multi-brand player will target manufacturers, 
dealers and short-term rental companies and independent direct distribution platforms. The objective is to reach 
€10 billion in assets by 2026, to which CACF’s investment of €100 million in Cosmobilis to finance new forms of 
mobility will contribute. These initiatives were in addition to the launch, in the third quarter of 2021, of CA Mobility, 
a joint offer between CACF and CAL&F of long-term car leasing distributed through long channel, short channel 
and to Group’s retail banks clients (Regional Banks and LCL). The objective is to reach a fleet of 100,000 vehicles 
by 2026. All these initiatives support CACF’s objective of achieving a 15% return on normative equity (RoNE) by 
2023, and reflect our strong ambitions in Europe in terms of mobility. The impact of the transactions on Crédit 
Agricole SA’s CET1 was neutral. In addition to these initiatives, CAL&F acquired Olinn in the fourth quarter of 
2021  to  expand  its  offer  to  professional  equipment  management  services,  and  CAL&F  launched  a  leasing 
business in Germany through the creation of a Vendoramed marketplace in the third quarter of 2021. The impact 
of the Olinn acquisition on Crédit Agricole S.A.’s CET1 ratio was -6 basis points in Q4 2021.Crédit Agricole Consumer Finance’s (CACF) commercial production increased in the fourth quarter of 2021 
compared to the third quarter of 2021 (+6% on a like-for-like basis78) and the fourth quarter of 2020 (+1% on a72 +5.5% increase in revenues, adjusted for the effect of the consolidation of CACEIS Fund Services

electronic components, production of automotive JVs was notably up this quarter (+4% compared to third quarter 
2021; but -12% compared to fourth quarter 2020). Assets under management at CACF totalled €92.5 billion at 
end December 2021. They were up +1.8% from end December 2020 and +0.5% from end December 2019. The 
increase  in  assets  was  driven  by  international  business79  (+4.1%  compared  to  end  December  2020)  and  by 
business with the Crédit Agricole Group (+4.6% compared to end December 2020). Assets related to automotive

2021, the increase  in  leasing production  was also significant  at  +20% compared to the same period  in  2020. 
Commercial factoring production increased by +29.3% in fourth quarter 2021 compared to fourth quarter 2020, 
thanks in particular to strong activity in Germany, and factored revenues were up by +24.1% compared to fourth 
quarter 2020, thanks to the increase in the financed quota. Outstanding leasing reached €16.1 billion at end 
December 2021 (of which €13 billion in France and €3.2 billion abroad), i.e. an increase of +4% compared to end 
December 2020.Income in Specialised financial services was up in fourth quarter 2021, by +7.1%78 compared to fourth quarter 
2020, thanks in particular to strong commercial activity. Underlying revenues of Specialised financial services 
excluding CACF NL were up +4.6% compared to fourth quarter 2020, driven both by strong revenues for CACF 
(+4.2% excluding CACF NL) and CAL&F (+5.7%). Underlying costs excluding CACF NL were up +8.3% (8.8%

underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF was stable at 50.5% (+0.3 percentage point below the cost/income 
ratio excluding SRF of 2020). The cost of risk decreased by -30.6%78, after the year 2020 was marked by strong 
provisions for performing loans in the context of the crisis. The underlying contribution of equity-accounted entities 
was  up  +18.8%,  thanks  to  the  good  performance  of  FCA  Bank  during  2021.  At  constant  scope, net income

compared to fourth quarter 2020, benefiting from dynamic activity in France and internationally and the increase 
of insurance revenues. CACF’s underlying costs on a like-for-like basis increased by +8.8%, in line with the 
evolution of the business and the full consolidation of CACF Spain (SoYou)80 (for an effect of €4,3 million, the 
increase in CACF's costs excluding this effect would be 7.1%). As a result, underlying gross operating income 
on a like-for-like basis remained stable compared to fourth quarter 2020 and the underlying cost/income ratio 
excluding  SRF  remained  low  on  a  like-for-like  basis  at  50.2%  (+2.1%  percentage  points  compared  to  fourth 
quarter 2020 on like-for-like basis). The contribution of equity-accounted entities was excellent and reached

for-like basis was low at -€118 million and down compared to fourth quarter 2020 (-8.3%), in line with the improved 
economic scenario. The cost of credit risk relative to outstandings81 over a rolling four-quarter period was 
128 basis points. The non performing loans ratio is at 5.5%, down -0.6 percentage point compared to end June

and the full consolidation  of SoYou, and  the underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF remained low  at 
49.9%, stable compared to 2020 (49.0%). Underlying gross operating income was also up +1.3% compared to 
2020.  The cost of risk decreased by -29.6%78 compared to 2020, despite the maintenance of prudent provisions 
for performing loans. The underlying contribution from equity-accounted entities performed well, up +18.8%, 
mainly due to strong activity at Gac Sofinco and Wafasalaf. Overall, the business line’s contribution to underlying 
net income Group share on a like-for-like basis was up +18.3%.The CACF business’s contribution to the net income Group share of Crédit Agricole S.A. over 2021 was 
10%.Leasing & FactoringIn fourth quarter 2021, CAL&F’s underlying revenues stood at €160 million, a sharp rise of +5.7% compared to 
fourth quarter 2020, thanks to the strong activity in both leasing and factoring. Costs excluding SRF were up by 
+6.8%  compared  to  fourth  quarter  2020,  in  line  with  IT  investments,  but  the  underlying  cost/income  ratio 
excluding SRF remained low at 51.6%, stable by +0.5 percentage point compared to fourth quarter 2020. This 
resulted  in  a  year-on-year  increase  in  gross  operating  income  of  +4.5%.  Cost  of  risk  remained  low  at 
€15 million, down -40.1% compared to fourth quarter 2020. CAL&F’s underlying net income Group share was

recovery of the factoring and leasing business, especially in Poland. The underlying cost/income ratio excluding 
SRF showed improvement, dropping 2 percentage points compared to 2020 to stand at 52.6%. This has led to a 
strong increase  in underlying gross operating income (+16.7%). The cost of risk fell significantly (-37.5%), 
reflecting  strong  provisioning  for  performing  loans  in  2020  in  the  context  of  the  crisis.  Finally,  underlying  net 
income Group share increased significantly (+43.5%) to €145 million.80 In third quarter 2021, full consolidation of SoYou on a line-by-line basis versus equity-accounted consolidation at 50% previously.

The Crédit Agricole S.A. Retail banking activity was very dynamic this quarter, driven at LCL by the production 
of housing, corporate, and SME and small business loans, and at Crédit Agricole Italia by dynamic commercial 
activity.Loan production at LCL was up sharply compared with fourth quarter 2020 (+24%82) for housing (€5.2 billion, 
+31%) and corporates (+31%82). The production of loans for SMEs and small businesses was stable over the 
period and reached a record level for the year. In this context, loans outstanding reached €150.6 billion at end 
December  2021  and  were  up  +5.0%  since  end  December  2020,  including  +7.3%  for  real  estate  loans  and 
+6.0%83  for  loans  to  SMEs  and  small  businesses.  Home  loan  renegotiations  remained  at  a  low  level  (€0.5 
billion outstanding this quarter) compared to €0.2 billion in fourth quarter 2020 and €0.5 billion in third quarter 
2021,  still  far  below  the  high  point  of  €5.2  billion  in  fourth  quarter  2016.  On-balance  sheet  deposits  rose 
compared to December 2020 (+5%), driven by DAVs (+12.2%), as did off-balance sheet savings, which were 
up by +7% year-on-year (including +5.2% in life insurance). Finally, customer capture remained dynamic with 
74,000 new customers this quarter and 335,000 new customers in 2021, and the customer base has grown by 
+36,000 since the beginning of the year. The equipment rate of car, home, health, legal, all mobile phones or 
personal accident insurance is up by +1.1 percentage point compared to end December 2020 (+2.9 percentage 
points compared to end December 2018) to 26.6% at end December 2021.CA Italia’s loan production remained very dynamic in the fourth quarter, driven in particular by growth in corporate 
loans. In 2021, production remained very dynamic at nearly €8 billion (-2.1% compared to 2020), particularly in 
home loans (+18.1% compared to 2020) and despite a lower production of corporate loans due to a base effect 
in 2020 linked to the implementation state-guaranteed loans (-20.1%). In addition, CA Italia has disposed of €1.5 
billion  in  doubtful  loans  in  fourth  quarter  2021.  Thus,  at  31  December  2021,  loan  outstandings  stood  at 
€59.4 billion.  Excluding  the  scope  effect  related  to  the  consolidation  of  Credito  Valtellinese  in  second  quarter 
2021, loan outstandings in Italy totalled €45.5 billion, stable by +0.1% year-on-year, driven by home loans (+4.9% 
year-on-year). Excluding loan disposals for €1.5 billion, the growth in loans for the historical scope was +3.4%. 
Balance sheet inflows continued to slow down (+2.3% Dec/Dec excluding the Credito Valtellinese scope effect), 
reflecting the resource optimisation policy initiated in December 2020. CA Italia's assets under management rose 
sharply year-on-year (+8.9% Dec/Dec excluding scope effect) with record net customer flows of €3.0 billion over 
2021.  Its  equipment  rate  in  car,  multi-risk  household,  health,  legal,  all  mobile  phones  or  personal  accident 
insurance increased to 19.0% (+1.9 percentage points from end December 2020, +3.6 percentage points from 
end 2019).Finally, for all the International retail banking excluding Italy, the growth in commercial activity remained rapid. 
Growth in loan outstandings reached +9.2% at end December 2021 compared to end December 2020 and +5.8% 
excluding foreign exchange impact, driven in particular by Ukraine (+21%), Poland (+12%) and Egypt (+15%), to 
total €12.8 billion. On-balance sheet deposits were up +8.0% excluding foreign exchange impact, especially in 
Ukraine  (+8%)  Poland  (+17%)  and  Egypt  (+16%).  Total  inflows  rose  by  +8.0%  year-on-year  and  by  +4.2% 
excluding  the  foreign  exchange  impact  to  €17.2 billion.  The  result  was  a  surplus  of  deposits  over  loans  in 
International retail banking outside Italy of +€2.9 billion at 31 December 2021.82 Excluding state-guaranteed loans

compared with fourth quarter 2020. This increase was driven by a strong rise in fee and commission income in 
all activities (7.6%). Underlying operating expenses excluding SRF remained under control at +0.7% in fourth 
quarter 2021 compared with fourth quarter 2020. As a result, the underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF 
improved (-1.5 percentage point compared with fourth quarter 2020) to 64.9% in fourth quarter 2021 (below the 
MTP target <66%), while underlying gross operating income rose sharply year-on-year (+7.5%). Cost of risk 
dropped by 39.1% compared with fourth quarter 2020 against the backdrop of an improved economic outlook, 
and  reached  -€54  million  in  fourth  quarter  2021.  The  doubtful  loans  ratio  remained  stable  (1.5%  at  end 
December 2021 compared with 1.5% at end September 2021) and the coverage ratio remained high (83.2% at 
end December 2021 compared with 83.5% at end September 2021). In the end, underlying net income Group 
share reached €199 million in fourth quarter 2021, up sharply year-on-year (+42.1%).In 2021, LCL’s underlying revenues increased by 4.5% compared with 2020, reaching €3,696 million, driven in a 
balanced way by, on the one hand, net interest margin (+4.5%) supported by good refinancing conditions and 
sustained commercial activity and, on the other hand, by fee and commissions income (+4.5%). Underlying costs 
excluding  SRF  were  under  control  (+1.0%).  This  led  to  an  improvement  in  the  underlying  cost/income  ratio 
excluding SRF of -2.2 percentage points compared with 2020, which stood at 62.2%. Underlying gross operating 
income thus increased by  nearly 10%. The cost of risk continued to fall and stood at -€222 million,  i.e.  down 
43.2% compared with 2020. All in all, the business line’s contribution to underlying net income Group share rose

quarter 2021 and by 0.8% on a like-for-like basis excluding the Creval acquisition in Italy. Underlying expenses 
excluding SRF increased by +31.0% to €594 million in fourth quarter 2021. At constant scope, this change was 
+7.3%.  As  a  result,  underlying  gross  operating  income  was  down  from  fourth  quarter  2020  to  stand  at 
€231 million, a decrease of -3.5% (-11.5% at constant scope). The underlying cost of risk rose +0.4% this quarter 
to -€132 million but was down -38.2% excluding the Creval acquisition. In the end, the International Retail Banking 
division’s underlying net income Group share came to €62 million, down -11.0% compared with fourth quarter 
2020. On a like-for-like basis (excluding Creval losses of -€11 million linked to the transition to a high cost of risk), 
the contribution of International Retail Banking rose by +5.0%.In  2021  underlying  revenues  for  the  International  Retail  Banking  division  rose  by  +17.2%  to  €3,115 million. 
Underlying  operating  expenses  excluding  SRF  increased  by  +15.7%  to  €1,976 million,  resulting  in  a 
-0.8 percentage point improvement in the underlying cost/income ratio which stood at 63.4%. Cost of risk fell by 
-23.5% to stand at €435 million for 2021. This translates into a net income Group share of €357 million for 2021,

stood at €597 million, including €126 million from the consolidation of Credito Valtellinese. Excluding this scope 
effect, CA Italia’s revenues were down -4.0% compared with fourth quarter 2020, impacted by the disposal of 
doubtful  loans  amounting  to  €1.5  billion  in  the  fourth  quarter  (see  below)  as  well  as  the  pressure  on  interest 
margins. Fee and commission income remained up by +2% compared with fourth quarter 2020, still supported 
by fee and commission income from outstanding managed savings. Underlying costs were up compared with 
fourth quarter 2020 (+40.7%) at €451 million, of which €107 million were related to Credito Valtellinese. Excluding 
this scope effect, costs would have increased by 7.2%, but remained stable (+0.7% compared with fourth quarter 
2020) excluding costs related to the contribution to the FITD (Italian deposit guarantee fund). Overall, underlying 
gross  operating  income  recorded  a  substantial  drop  of  -14.0%  versus  fourth  quarter  2020  (-25.2%  excluding 
scope effect). Cost of risk increased by +4.3% compared with fourth quarter 2020 with significant provisions on 
the Creval scope for performing loans, in order to bring the bank in line with Credit Agricole Italia’s practices. The 
risk profile of the historical CA Italia scope has also been improved by the disposal of doubtful loans for €1.5 
billion. The doubtful loan ratio at 31 December 2021 for Crédit Agricole Italia’s historical scope was 3.7%, down 
2.6 percentage points compared with the third quarter of 2021. The coverage ratio of doubtful loans on Crédit 
Agricole  Italia's  historical  scope  was  therefore  68.3%,  reinforced  by  the  exceptional  provision  of  €125  million 
reclassified as specific items. On the Creval scope, on the other hand, the coverage ratio was low in the fourth 
quarter,  as  the  loans  were  brought  to  the  Group’s  balance  sheet  at  their  net  provision  value  as  required  by 
accounting  standards.  As  a  result,  CA  Italia’s  coverage  ratio  at  31  December  2021  was  62.0%  (down  7.2 
percentage points). CA Italia’s net income group share thus amounted to €21 million, down -35.8% compared 
with the fourth quarter of 2020, with the underlying contribution of -€11 million this quarter for Creval weighing on 
the business line’s profitability. CA Italia’s net income group share on its historical scope was therefore stable 
this quarter (-2.0%).During the quarter, the CreVal consolidation process continued according to schedule.The accounting consolidation of Credito Valtellinese was completed this quarter, with the PPA being finalised in 
the  fourth  quarter.  As  a  result,  Credit  Agricole  Italia  recognised  a  100%  net  badwill  of  €497  million  over  the 
financial year, including €119 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 (i.e. a respective impact of €376 million and 
€90 million on net income group share, with these items being reclassified as specific items). The due diligence 
and Creval consolidation operations also gave rise to other adjustments, also classified as specific items: the 
recognition of off-balance sheet deferred tax assets for €105 million (€80 million in net income group share), -€14 
million in other adjustments following due diligence work (-€9 million in specific items) and costs for upgrading 
and migrating the technological  infrastructure and the IT platform (-€47 million  in integration costs over 2021, 
including  -€23  million  in  the  fourth  quarter  alone;  impact  on  net  income  group  share  of  -€24  million  and  -€12 
million respectively).In  order  to  prepare  for  the  future,  Credit  Agricole  Italia  has  also  initiated  certain  transformations.  In  Italy,  the 
Group has launched a substantial Next Generation HR plan, which will result in the departure of approximately 
1,100 employees through a job preservation plan and retirements, and approximately 550 new hires. €190 million 
was accounted for in the fourth quarter to finance this plan (impact of -€97 million on net income group share; 
reclassified as specific items). CA Italia also made a significant disposal of its non-performing loans portfolio this 
quarter, amounting to €1.5 billion, in order to improve the Group’s risk profile (cost of risk impact of -€194 million) 
and  accounted  for  additional  provisions  on  its  residual  portfolio,  in  order  to  comply  with  the  Group’s  new  risk 
policies, amounting to -€125 million. These items impacting the cost of risk have been reclassified as specific 
items for a total impact on net income Group share of -€161 million. Lastly, CA Italia successfully concluded the 
takeover  bid  for  CA  FriulAdria  in  September  2021  and  now  holds  more  than  99%  of  the  share  capital  of  this 
structure, enabling it to prepare for the merger of the bank into CA Italia.Crédit Agricole Italia’s underlying revenues rose by +24.8% over the full year to €2,279 million (+4.5% excluding 
scope effect). Operating expenses excluding SRF were kept under control (+24.3% but +1.7% excluding scope 
effect), improving the underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF to 62.3% (an improvement of -1.8 percentage34/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021points Dec/Dec on a like-for-like basis and -0.2 percentage point excluding scope effect). Underlying cost of risk 
fell sharply in 2021 to €347 million (-18.9% and -40.9% excluding the scope effect), benefiting from a very high 
2020 base. This resulted in a very strong increase in CA Italia’s contribution over the financial year to €244 million 
in underlying income, i.e. +69.3% compared with 2020 and +61.7% in underlying income on a like-for-like basis.CA Italia’s underlying RoNE for 2021 was 9.0%.Crédit Agricole Group in ItalyThe Group’s income in Italy stood at €751 million for 2021, an improvement of +31% compared with 2020, due 
to the growth in operating income, the scope effect related to Creval and the decrease in the cost of risk of the 
Group’s subsidiaries in Italy. During the year, the Group’s business lines all strengthened in Italy. CA Italia was 
ranked  second  in  Italy  in  terms  of  customer  satisfaction84.  Amundi,  with  nearly  €200  billion  in  assets  under 
management, had an excellent  year in terms of activity with net inflows of €12 billion over 2021, including €5 
billion in the fourth quarter. In insurance, the market share of life contracts increased by 1.5 percentage points to 
6.8% thanks to the development of sales of unit-linked products85. The property and casualty business continued 
to  grow  with  the  continuation  of  customer  equipment  rates  in  a  strong  competitive  environment.  For  its  part, 
CACIB  was  ranked  second  bookrunner  LT  in  transactional  value  of  syndicated  loans  in  Italy86,  while  Agos 
confirmed its position as the second largest operator in Italy for consumer loans with a market share of 8.9% in 
2021 (up 70 basis points compared with 2020)87.International Retail Banking – excluding ItalyIn  August  2021,  Crédit  Agricole  S.A.  announced  the  disposal  of  its  Serbian  subsidiary,  Credit  Agricole  Srbija 
A.D.,  which  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  first  half  2022.  The  results  of  this  entity  for  the  year  were  thus 
reclassified  under  IFRS 5  during  the  third  quarter,  impacting  all  income  lines  for  International  Retail  Banking 
excluding Italy.88On  a  like-for-like  basis88,  the  entities’  revenues  grew  strongly,  with  the  development  of  the  business  and  the 
absorption  of  the  2020  key  rate  cuts  in  the  various  countries.  Underlying  revenues  on  a  like-for-like  basis  of 
International  retail  banking  excluding  Italy  rose  by  20.3%  compared  with  fourth  quarter  2020,  at  €227 million. 
Underlying costs excluding SRF on a like-for-like basis increased (14.7% compared with fourth quarter 2020) 
reflecting the weight of IT investments, the resumption of commercial campaigns as well as inflationary pressures. 
As a result, the underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF of International retail banking excluding Italy  was 
62.6%, down 2.9 percentage points compared with fourth quarter 2020. Underlying gross operating income on a 
like-for-like basis was therefore up (€ 30.9%) compared with fourth quarter 2020. The cost of risk fell (-19.2% 
compared to fourth quarter 2020) to -€14 million. The rate of doubtful loans was low at 6.6% at end December 
2021, decreasing in particular with the disposal of a portfolio of doubtful loans in Poland. The coverage ratio is at 
a high level of 100%. AT the end, the underlying net income Group share on a like-for-like basis was €38 million, 
up +12.4% compared with fourth quarter 2020.By country:-  Poland89: revenues were up sharply (+24%), driven by the capture and development of fee andcommission income; expenses increased by (+14%) reflecting IT investments in the networks as well 
as the launch of advertising campaigns to support the capture. The doubtful loans coverage ratio 
reached 104%.-  CA Egypt89: gross operating revenue rose +11% compared with fourth quarter 2020 and thecost/income ratio remained below 40%.84 Sources: CAI - DOXA IRC Strategic 2021 Survey;

89 Excluding foreign exchange impact35/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021-  CA Ukraine89: revenues remained strong (up +24% compared with fourth quarter 2020) owing to agood level of activity. Costs remained contained in a strong inflationary context and the doubtful loan 
rate remained low at 1.1%.-  Crédit du Maroc89: activity and revenues remained steady and the cost of risk benefited from provisionreversals.In 2021, the underlying revenues of retail banking excluding Italy increased by 0.4% to €836 million (+6.6% on a 
like-for-like basis) thanks to the gradual absorption of decrease in key rates that took place in 2020 and to the 
strong development of the commercial activity. Operating expenses excluding SRF increased by 3.1% (3.2% on 
a like-for-like basis) to €522 million, reflecting IT investments and inflationary pressure in these countries. This 
led to a slight improvement in the underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF, which stood at 62.5%, down more 
than 2 percentage points compared with 2020. Cost of risk is down, illustrating the quality of the credit portfolios 
and their coverage. In the end, the business line’s contribution to net income Group share rose sharply over the 
year, by 39.9% to €113 million (51.7% on a like-for-like basis).The underlying RoNE of Other IRB stood at 14.4% in 2021, compared with 12.3% in 2020.The International retail banking business line contributed for 6% to the underlying net income Group share of 
Crédit Agricole S.A.'s core businesses (excluding the Corporate Centre division) in 2021 and 14% to underlying 
revenues excluding the Corporate Centre division.The  entire  Retail  banking  business  line  contributed  for  19%  to  the  underlying  net  income  Group  share  of 
Crédit Agricole S.A.'s core businesses (excluding the Corporate Centre division) in 2021 and 30% to underlying 
revenues excluding the Corporate Centre division.As at 31 December 2021, the capital allocated to the division was €9.7 billion, including €4.8 billion for French 
retail  banking  and  €4.9 billion  for  International  retail  banking.  Risk  weighted  assets  for  the  division  totalled 
€101.6 billion including €50.3 billion for French retail banking and €51.4 billion for International retail banking.Corporate Centre 
The underlying net income Group share of the Corporate Centre division was -€26 million in fourth quarter 2021, 
up +€225 million compared with fourth quarter 2020. An analysis of the negative contribution of the Corporate 
Centre looks at both the “structural” contribution (-€109 million) and other items (+€83 million).The contribution of the “structural” component rose compared with fourth quarter 2020 (+€106 million) due to the 
improvement of the balance sheet structure, as well as the increase in revenues of the division's other business 
lines. This contribution includes three types of activities:---The  activities  and  functions  of  the  Corporate  Centre  of  the  Crédit  Agricole S.A.  corporate  entity.  This 
contribution reached -€175 million in fourth quarter 2021, up +€20 million compared with fourth quarter 
2020, in line with the improvement of the balance sheet structure.The  sub-divisions  that  are  not  part  of  the  core  business  lines,  such  as  CACIF  (Private  equity)  and 
CA Immobilier and, since first quarter 2021, BforBank, equity-accounted as it is 50% owned by Crédit 
Agricole S.A. following its capital increase. Their contribution, at +€63 million in fourth quarter 2021, rose 
by €58 million compared with fourth quarter 2020, explained by the increase in CACIF revenues, linked 
to disposals and the revaluation of certain funds.The  Group’s  support  functions.  Their  contribution  of  +€2  million  this  quarter  rose  by  €29  million  from 
fourth quarter 2020, mainly due to higher revenues from Crédit Agricole Payment Services.The contribution of “other items” amounted to +€83 million, up €119 million from fourth quarter 2020, due to a 
positive impact of non-Group dividends and inflation on the valuation of hedging swaps.Over  2021,  the  underlying  net  income  Group  share  of  the  Corporate  Centre  division  was  -€463 million,  an 
improvement of €270 million compared with 2020. The structural component contributed -€694 million and other 
items of the division recorded a positive contribution of +€232 million over 202136/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021The “structural” component contribution is up  €69 million compared with 2020 and can be broken down into three 
types of activities:--The  activities  and  functions  of  the  Corporate  Centre  of  the  Crédit  Agricole S.A.  corporate  entity.  This 
contribution amounted to -€833 million for 2021, down by €87 million compared with 2020;The business lines that are not part of the business line divisions, such as CACIF (Private equity) and 
CA Immobilier and, since first quarter 2021, BforBank, equity-accounted as it is 50% owned by Crédit 
Agricole S.A. following its capital increase: their contribution of +€130 million over 2021 was up compared 
with 2020 (+€145 million).-  Group  support  functions:  their  contribution  over  2021  was  +€9  million,  up  €14  million  compared  with2020, notably due to a change in 2021 in the way CAGIP income and expenses are recognised.The contribution of “other items” in 2021 was +€232 million, up €201 million compared with 2020, notably due 
to the positive impact of non-Group dividends and inflation on the valuation of hedging swaps in fourth quarter 
2021,  and,  in  particular,  in  the  second  and  third  quarters  of  2021,  eliminations  on  intra-group  securities 
underwritten by Predica and Amundi.At 31 December 2021, risk-weighted assets stood at 25.7 billion euros.***37/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021Financial strengthCrédit Agricole GroupAs at 31 December 2021, the phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of Crédit Agricole Group was 
17.5%,  an  increase  of  +0.1  percentage  points  compared  to  end  September  2021.  Therefore,  Crédit  Agricole 
Group posted a substantial buffer of +8.6 percentage points between the level of its CET1 ratio and the 8.9% 
SREP (Supervisory review and evaluation process) requirement. The fully loaded CET1 ratio is 17.2%.-  Retained income: +38 basis points in stated income: and -8 basis points in distribution and payment ofAT1 coupons.-  Business line growth (“risk weighted assets variation”): -14 bp concentrated mainly on Regional Banks.-  Additional distribution: an additional distribution of €0.20 per share for the 2019 dividend catch-up (-4 bp) as well as the impact of the second share buyback (-9 bp) are also included.-  M&A: taking into account recent acquisitions: Olinn -4 bp, Lyxor -8 bp, ByMyCar -1 bp, Creval +1 bp(including badwill for +6 bp, and various other items for -5 bp, notably DTA)-  Other: includes in particular an impact related to capital increases, the one reserved for employees (+4bp) as well as the one related to issuance of new mutual shares (+3 bp).The phased-in leverage ratio stood at 6.1%, +0.1 percentage point compared to end September 2021 (5.4% 
before the exclusion of ECB exposures) and well above the regulatory requirement of 3.11%90. The daily phased-
in leverage ratio was 5.5% at 31 December 202191 before the exclusion of ECB exposures.The Crédit Agricole Group’s risk weighted assets increased by €2.8 billion compared with 30 September 2021, 
including €1.6 billion for Regional Banks.Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) triggerThe  transposition  of  Basel  regulations  into  European  law  (CRD)  introduced  a  restriction  mechanism  for 
distribution that applies to dividends, AT1 instruments and variable compensation. The Maximum Distributable 
Amount (MDA, the maximum sum a bank is allowed to allocate to distributions) principle aims to place limitations 
on distributions in the event the latter were to result in non-compliance with combined buffer requirements.The distance to the MDA trigger is the lowest of the respective distances to the SREP requirements in CET1 
capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital.At 31 December 2021, Crédit Agricole Group posted a buffer of 772 basis points above the MDA trigger, i.e. 
€45 billion in CET1 capital.At 31 December 2021, Crédit Agricole S.A. posted a buffer of 335 basis points above the MDA trigger, i.e. 
€13 billion in CET1 capital.90  Under  CRR2,  banks  may  exclude  certain  Central  Bank  exposures  from  the  total  exposure  of  the  leverage  ratio  when  justified  by  exceptional 
macroeconomic circumstances. If this exemption is applied, institutions must meet an adjusted leverage ratio requirement of more than 3%. On 18 
June 2021, the European Central Bank announced that credit institutions under its supervision could apply this exclusion due to the existence of 
exceptional circumstances since 31 December 2019; this measure is applicable until 31 March 2022 included. The Crédit Agricole Group applies this 
provision and must, therefore, comply with a leverage ratio requirement of 3.11% during this period.91 The daily leverage ratio is calculated by taking into account the daily average of the quarter’s securities financing transactions (SFTs) exposures38/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021TLACThe Financial Stability Board (FSB) has defined the calculation of a ratio aimed at estimating the adequacy of 
the  bail-in  and 
(G-SIBs).  This 
Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) ratio provides resolution authorities with the means to assess whether G-
SIBs  have  sufficient  bail-in  and  recapitalisation  capacity  before  and  during  resolution.  It  applies  to  Global 
Systemically Important Banks, and therefore to Crédit Agricole Group.recapitalisation  capacity  of  Global  SystemicallyImportant  BanksThe elements that could absorb losses consist of equity, subordinated notes and debts to which the Resolution 
Authority can apply the bail-in.The TLAC ratio requirement was transposed into European Union law via CRR2 and has been applicable since 
27 June 2019. As from that date, Crédit Agricole Group must comply with the following requirements at all times:-a TLAC ratio above 16% of risk weighted assets (RWA), plus – in accordance with EU directive CRD 5 – a 
combined capital buffer requirement (including, for the Crédit Agricole Group, a 2.5% capital conservation 
buffer,  a  1%  G-SIB  buffer  and  the  counter-cyclical  buffer  set  at  0.02%  for  the  CA  Group  at  31/12/21). 
Considering the combined capital buffer requirement, the Crédit Agricole Group must adhere to a TLAC ratio 
of above 19.5%;-a TLAC ratio of above 6% of the Leverage Ratio Exposure (LRE).As from 1 January 2022, the minimum TLAC requirements will increase to 18% of risk weighted assets – plus 
the combined buffer requirement at that date – and 6.75% of the leverage ratio exposure.At 31 December 2021, Crédit Agricole Group’s TLAC ratio stood at 26.3% of RWA and 8.7% of leverage 
ratio exposure, excluding eligible senior preferred debt 92, which is well above the requirements. The TLAC ratio 
excluding eligible senior preferred debt expressed as a percentage of risk weighted assets increased by 30 bp 
over the quarter, as the moderate increase in RWAs was more than offset by the increase in eligible equity and 
liabilities.  Expressed  as  a  percentage  of  leverage  exposure  (LRE),  the  TLAC  ratio  excluding  eligible  senior 
preferred debt climbed 20 bp compared with September 2021. Without taking into account the neutralisation of 
Central Bank exposures, such TLAC ratio expressed in LRE would have reached 7.8% (+20 bp compared with 
September 2021).The Group thus has a TLAC ratio excluding eligible senior preferred debt that is 680 bps higher, i.e. €40 billion, 
than the current requirement of 19.5% of RWA. Compared with the new requirements applying from 1 January 
2022, such TLAC ratio is 480 bp, or €28 billion higher, than the TLAC requirement expressed in RWA (i.e. at 
21.5% RWA + countercyclical buffer as of 31 December 2021).Achievement of the TLAC ratio is supported by a TLAC debt issuance programme of around €7 billion in the 
wholesale market in 2021. At 31 December 2021, €6.3 billion equivalent had been issued in the market (senior 
non-preferred and Tier  2  debt); the amount  of the Crédit  Agricole Group senior  non-preferred debt taken into 
account in the calculation of the TLAC ratio was €26.1 billion.92 As part of its annual resolvability assessment, Crédit Agricole Group has chosen to waive the possibility offered by Article 72ter(3) of the CapitalRequirements Regulation to use senior preferred debt for compliance with its TLAC requirements in 2021 and 2022.39/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021MRELThe MREL (Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities) ratio is defined in the European “Bank 
Recovery and Resolution Directive” (BRRD). This Directive establishes a framework for the resolution of banks 
throughout the European Union, with the aim to provide resolution authorities with shared instruments and powers 
to  pre-emptively  tackle  banking  crises,  preserve  financial  stability  and  reduce  taxpayers’  exposure  to  losses. 
Directive (EU) 2019/879 of 20 May 2019 known as “BRRD2” amended the BRRD and was transposed into French 
law by Order 2020-1636 of 21 December 2020.The MREL ratio corresponds to an own funds and eligible liabilities buffer required to absorb losses in the event 
of  resolution.  Under  BRRD2,  the  MREL  ratio  is  calculated  as  the  amount  of  eligible  capital  and  liabilities 
expressed as a percentage of risk weighted assets (RWA), as well as a leverage ratio exposure (LRE). Eligible 
for the numerator of the total MREL ratio are the Group’s regulatory capital, as well as eligible liabilities issued 
by the central body and its affiliated entities, i.e. subordinated notes, senior non-preferred debt instruments and 
certain senior preferred debt instruments with residual maturities of more than one year.The  required  minimum  levels  are  set  by  decisions  of  resolution  authorities  and  then  communicated  to  each 
institution, then revised periodically. As from 1 January 2022, the Crédit Agricole Group must meet a minimum 
total MREL requirement of:-21.04%  of  RWA,  plus  –  in  accordance  with  EU  directive  CRD 5  –  a  combined  capital  buffer  requirement 
(including,  for  the  Crédit Agricole  Group,  a  2.5%  capital  conservation  buffer,  a  1%  G-SIB  buffer  and  the 
counter-cyclical buffer set at 0.02% for the CA Group at 31/12/21). Considering the combined capital buffer 
requirement, the Crédit Agricole Group must adhere to a total MREL ratio of above 24.6%;-6.02% of the LRE.At 31 December 2021, the Crédit Agricole Group had an estimated MREL ratio of 30.5% of RWA and 10.1% 
of leverage exposure, well above the total MREL requirement.An additional subordination requirement to TLAC (“subordinated MREL”) is also  determined by the resolution 
authorities and expressed as a percentage of RWA and LRE, in which senior debt instruments are excluded, 
similar to TLAC, whose ratio is equivalent to the subordinated MREL for the Crédit Agricole Group. At 1 January 
2022, this subordinated MREL requirement for the Crédit Agricole Group did not exceed the TLAC requirement.The distance to the maximum distributable amount trigger related to MREL requirements (M-MDA) is the lowest 
of the respective distances to the MREL, subordinated MREL and TLAC requirements expressed in RWA.At  31  December  2021,  the  Crédit  Agricole  Group  would  thus  have  a  buffer  of  480  bp  above  the  M-MDA 
trigger, taking into account the TLAC requirement applicable as of 1 January 2022, i.e. €28 billion of CET1 
capital.Crédit Agricole Group’s target is to reach a subordinated MREL ratio (excluding eligible senior preferred 
debt) of 24-25% of the RWA by the end of 2022 (a goal achieved in September 2020) and to maintain the 
subordinated MREL ratio above 8% of TLOF93. This level would enable recourse to the Single Resolution Fund 
(subject to the decision of the resolution authority) before applying the bail-in to senior preferred debt, creating 
an additional layer of protection for investors in senior preferred debt. At 31 December 2021, the subordinated 
MREL ratio reached 8.6% of TLOF.93 Total Liabilities and Own Funds (TLOF) – equivalent to the total prudential balance sheet after netting of derivatives40/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021Crédit Agricole S.A.At end December 2021, Crédit Agricole S.A.’s solvency level remained high, with a phased-in Common Equity 
Tier  1  (CET1)  ratio  of  11.9%  (down  0.8  percentage  point  from  end  September  2021).  Crédit  Agricole  S.A. 
therefore had a substantial buffer of 4 percentage points between the level of its CET1 ratio and the 7.9% SREP 
requirement. The fully loaded CET1 ratio is 11.6%.-  Retained income: +36 bp in reported earnings and -21 bp in distribution and payment of AT1 coupons 
for the fourth quarter (dividend provision of €0.24 per share for the quarter based on a 50% distribution 
policy bringing the annual provision to €0.85 per share).-The annual dividend provision is completed on one hand by the continued catch-up of the 2019 dividend 
by €0.20 per share (-16 bp), on a total of €0.40 per share, as well as by the finalisation of the second 
share buyback tranche (for € 500 million, or -14 bp). The total dividend provision for the year 2021 is 
therefore €1.05 per share.-  Business  line  growth  (“risk  weighted  assets  variation”):  -  6  bp,  with  an  impact  concentrated  inSpecialised Financial Services.-  M&A: -16 bp, linked to the finalisation of acquisition operations: Olinn -6 bp, Lyxor -12 bp, ByMy Car -1bp and Creval +2 bp (the badwill of +10 bp being offset by other items for -8 bp, DTA notably).-  Switch and others: -47 bp, mainly due to the unwinding of the remaining 50% of the Switch insurance 
guarantee (-60 bp). Other elements were added, notably the capital increase reserved for employees (+6 
bp) and a positive foreign exchange impact over the quarter.The phased leverage ratio stands at 4.6% at end December 2021 compared with a requirement of 3.18%94. The 
leverage ratio before neutralisation of ECB exposures is 3.9%, stable compared with the end of September 2021. 
The phased-in daily leverage ratio95  was 3.8% before the exclusion of ECB exposures.Crédit Agricole Group’s risk weighted assets were up €19 billion compared with 30 September 2021, mainly due 
to the unwinding of the remaining 50% of the switch insurance guarantee (+€17 billion). The rest of the increase 
was recorded in Specialised Financial Services (€1.3 billion), resulting notably from the peak in activity in fourth 
quarter 2021 for CAL&F, and in Large Customers (€0.4 billion).94  Under  CRR2,  banks  may  exclude  certain  Central  Bank  exposures  from  the  total  exposure  of  the  leverage  ratio  when  justified  by  exceptional 
macroeconomic circumstances. If this exemption is applied, institutions must meet an adjusted leverage ratio requirement of more than 3%. On 18 
June 2021, the European Central Bank announced that credit institutions under its supervision could apply this exclusion due to the existence of 
exceptional  circumstances  since  31  December  2019;  this  measure  is  applicable  until  31  March  2022  included.  Crédit  Agricole  S.A.  applies  this 
provision and must, therefore, comply with a leverage ratio requirement of 3.18% during this period95 Crédit Agricole S.A.’s daily leverage ratio is calculated by taking into account the daily average of the quarter’s securities financing transactions(SFTs) exposures41/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021Liquidity and FundingLiquidity is measured at Crédit Agricole Group level.In order to provide simple, relevant and auditable information on the Group’s liquidity position, the banking cash

on the definition of a mapping table between the Group’s IFRS financial statements and the sections of the cash 
balance sheet as they appear in the next table and whose definition is commonly accepted in the marketplace. It 
relates  to  the  banking  scope,  with  insurance  activities  being  managed  in  accordance  with  their  own  specific 
prudential constraints.Further  to  the  breakdown  of  the  IFRS  financial  statements  in  the  sections  of  the  cash  balance  sheet,  netting 
calculations are carried out. They relate to certain assets and liabilities that have a symmetrical impact in terms 
of liquidity risk. Deferred taxes, fair value impacts, collective impairments, short-selling transactions and other 
assets  and  liabilities  were  netted  for  a  total  of  €67  billion  at  end-December  2021.  Similarly,  €93 billion  in 
repos/reverse  repos  were  eliminated  insofar  as  these  outstandings  reflect  the  activity  of  the  securities  desk 
carrying out securities borrowing and lending operations that offset each other. Other nettings calculated in order 
to  build  the  cash  balance  sheet—for  an  amount  totalling  €138  billion  at  end-December  2021—relate  to 
derivatives,  margin  calls,  adjustment/settlement/liaison  accounts  and  to  non-liquid  securities  held  by  the 
Corporate and Investment banking division and are included in the “Customer-related trading assets” section.Note that deposits centralised with Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations are not netted in order to build the cash 
balance sheet; the amount of centralised deposits (€71 billion at end-December 2021) is booked to assets under 
“Customer-related trading assets” and to liabilities under “Customer-related funds”.In  a  final  stage,  other  restatements  reassign  outstandings  that  accounting  standards  allocate  to  one  section, 
when they are economically related to another. As such, senior issues placed through the banking networks as 
well  as  financing  by  the  European  Investment  Bank,  the  Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations  and  other 
refinancing transactions of the same type backed by customer loans, which accounting standards would classify 
as “Medium long-term market funds”, are reclassified as “Customer-related funds”.Note that for Central Bank refinancing transactions, outstandings related to the T-LTRO (Targeted Longer-Term 
Refinancing Operations) are included in “Long-term market funds”. In fact, T-LTRO 3 transactions are similar to 
long-term secured refinancing transactions, identical from a liquidity risk standpoint to a secured issue.Medium to long-term repos are also included in “Long-term market funds”.Finally, the CIB’s counterparties that are banks with which we have a commercial relationship are considered as 
customers in the construction of the cash balance sheet.Standing at €1,630 billion at 31 December 2021, the Group’s banking cash balance sheet shows a surplus of 
stable funding resources over stable application of funds of €279 billion, down €14 billion compared with 
end September 2020 and up €14 billion compared with end December 2020.Total T-LTRO 3 outstandings for the Crédit Agricole Group amounts to €162 billion96 at 31 December 2021. It 
should be noted that the interest rate applicable to the refinancing rate of these operations is accrued over the 
drawdown period. The special interest rate is accrued over the related special interest rate period. The special 
interest rate applicable  to the refinancing rate for these operations for the second period (June 2021 to June 
2022) was taken into account in Q4 2021 for all drawdowns.The Group once again recorded momentum in commercial activity during the quarter, with an increase of €15 
billion in inflows and €29 billion in loans.The surplus of 279 billion euros, known as “stable resources position”, allows the Group to cover the LCR deficit 
generated by long term assets and stable liabilities (customer, tangible and intangible assets, long-term funds,

in T-LTRO 3 outstanding in order to secure the Medium-Term Plan target of more than €100 billion, irrespective 
of the future repayment strategy.The NSFR of Crédit Agricole Group and Crédit Agricole S.A. exceeded 100%, in accordance with the regulatory 
requirement applicable since 28 June 2021.Furthermore, given the excess liquidity, the Group remained in  a short-term lending position at  31 December 
2021 (central bank deposits exceeding the amount of short-term net debt).Medium-to-long-term market resources were €344 billion at 31 December 2021, down €3 billion compared 
with end September 2021, and up €23 billion compared with end December 2020.They included senior secured debt of €222 billion, senior preferred debt of €72 billion, senior non-preferred debt 
of €29 billion and Tier 2 securities amounting to €21 billion.At 31 December 2021, the Group’s liquidity reserves, at market value and after haircuts, amounted to 
€465 billion,  down  €4 billion  from  end  September  2021  and  up  €27 billion  from  end  December  2020.  They 
covered short-term net debt more than four times over (excluding the replacements with Central Banks).The  high  level  of  central  bank  deposits  was  the  result  of  the  replacement  of  significant  excess  liquidity:  they 
amounted  to  €227 billion  at  31  December  2021  (excluding  cash  and  mandatory  reserves),  down  -€16 billion 
compared to end September 2021 and up +€41 billion compared to end December 2020.Crédit Agricole Group also continued its efforts to maintain immediately available reserves (after recourse to ECB 
financing). Central bank eligible assets after haircuts amounted to €113 billion.Credit institutions are subject to a threshold for the LCR ratio, set at 100% on 1 January 2018.The average LCR ratios over 12 months at 31 December 2021 were respectively 170.9% for Crédit Agricole 
Group and 153.0% for Crédit Agricole S.A. They exceeded the Medium-Term Plan target of around 110%.In the context of the COVID-19 health crisis, the increase in the level of LCR ratios of Crédit Agricole Group and 
Crédit Agricole S.A. was in line with the recourse of the Group to T-LTRO 3 drawings from the central bank.The  Group  continues  to  follow  a  prudent  policy  as  regards  medium-to-long-term  refinancing,  with  a  very 
diversified access to markets in terms of investor base and products.In 2021, the Group’s main issuers raised the equivalent of €30.0 billion97 in medium-to-long-term debt on 
the markets, 28% of which was issued by Crédit Agricole S.A. Noteworthy events in 2021 for the Group were as 
follows:•  Crédit Agricole Assurances issued a Tier 2 10 year bullet bond in September for €1 billion to refinanceintra-group subordinated debt.•  Crédit Agricole next bank (Switzerland) has completed two covered bond issuances this year for CHF350 
million, including an inaugural covered bond issuance in Green format at 10 years for CHF150 million in 
September;•  Crédit Agricole Italia issued a first Green covered bond for €500 million at 12 years in March.In addition, €4.3 billion was also borrowed from national and supranational organisations or placed in the Group’s 
Retail banking networks (Regional Banks, LCL, CA Italia) and other external retail networks at 2021.In 2021, Crédit Agricole S.A. completed 95% of its medium-long term financing programme of €9 billion 
on the markets for 2021 (including €7 billion in non-preferred senior debt or Tier 2 debt).The bank raised the equivalent of €8.5 billion98, of which €4.2 billion in senior non-preferred debt and €2.1 billion 
in Tier 2 debt, as well as €0.7 billion in senior preferred debt and €1.5 billion in senior secured debt. The funding 
is diversified with various formats and currencies (EUR, USD, AUD, GBP, JPY, CNY, CHF, NOK).97 Gross amount before buy-backs and amortisations

response (roll-out of vaccination, containment strategy), the structure of the economies (relative weight of industry 
and services, including tourism), and the fiscal and monetary counter-offensive (extent of support for activity). As 
with the recessions experienced in 2020, recovery paths have remained uneven. China, boosted by its 
foreign trade and growing at a rate of 8.1%, the United States and then the Eurozone, which posted very 
good performances, continued to be contrasted with the half-hearted recoveries or fragile rebounds of 
many emerging countries, in which the trend towards fragmentation was clearly confirmed.Moreover, inflation, long forgotten, has returned to the forefront. The very sharp acceleration was the result of a 
combination of several factors: upstream pressures with strong increases in commodity prices and bottlenecks101, 
downstream pressures from the strong rebound in household consumption supported by substantial financial aid 
and high savings inherited from the 2020 crisis, and base effects after very low inflation in 2020. While supply 
remained  limited  at  the  end  of  the  crisis  (lack  of  labour  or  goods),  the  normalisation  of  demand  led  to  price 
increases in specific sectors, particularly those previously heavily penalised by the pandemic (hotels, restaurants 
or cars, for example).In the United States, after Donald Trump’s US$2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act 
(CARES Act), the largest support plan in US history, and the US$900 billion December plan (a total of about 14% 
of GDP), Joe Biden’s stimulus package (the American Rescue Plan) totalling $1.9 trillion, or about 9% of GDP, 
was rolled out in March. Households, mainly those with low incomes, were the main beneficiaries. Thanks to the 
strong recovery in consumption, further boosted by the rapid fall in unemployment, growth has stood at 5.7% in 
2021. In December, overall year-on-year inflation reached 7% (the first time this has happened since the early 
1980s), with core inflation at 5.5%, its highest level since the early 1990s. In addition to the impact of energy and 
industrial input prices, some specific items (e.g. new cars, but especially used cars) driven by strong demand 
contributed to the acceleration of inflation.The Eurozone has withstood the latest lockdown phases by limiting the negative effects to the sectors subject 
to targeted restrictive measures and by benefiting from the reactivation of its manufacturing sector. A pleasant 
surprise came from strong production investment supported by the strength of demand for manufactured goods, 
but also by the European funds of the recovery plan. After contracting by 6.5% in 2020, GDP is expected to grow 
by 5.2% in 2021. While excess demand and wage acceleration are much less evident than in the United States, 
headline inflation nevertheless picked up significantly to 5% year-on-year in December, while core inflation rose 
less vigorously (2.6%).After  suffering  an  8%  recession  in  2020,  France  started  a  strong  recovery  in  the  second  half  of  2020  and 
continued into 2021. The new wave of infections and the spread of the Omicron variant raised new fears about 
the strength of the recovery in the short term, but the absence of very restrictive measures made it possible to 
limit the  impact. After a marked mechanical rebound in the third  quarter, growth slowed  in the fourth  quarter, 
while remaining sustained, allowing GDP to rise by 7% in 2021. Driven by the rise in commodity prices (especially 
energy, which accounts for more than half of the price increase), inflation accelerated to 2.8% over 12 months in 
December (1.6% on average).Despite a shift in the Federal Reserve’s rhetoric suggesting a more rapid normalisation of its monetary policy, an 
accommodative monetary stance was maintained in both the United States and the Eurozone.In the United States, at the start of the year, Jerome Powell emphasised the still extremely weakened nature of 
the labour market and the low employment rate compared to its pre-crisis level. However, concerns gradually 
shifted from growth to inflation which, after being considered temporary, became more worrying. At the same 
time, the Fed announced its strategy of gradual normalisation: gradual reduction of its monthly asset purchases101 As prices can be very volatile, it is preferable to use average annual prices. Between 2020 and 2021, the price of oil (Brent) rose by almost 70%, 
while the price of gas in Europe quadrupled. The CRB index has risen by 43%. Iron and copper prices rose by 46% and 51% respectively. Food 
prices were not spared, as evidenced by the 23% rise in wheat prices. Finally, the Baltic Dry Index almost tripled, reflecting the extremely high level 
of tension in maritime traffic.45/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021(US$120 billion in force at the time) or tapering and then, without any pre-established timetable, raising its key 
rate (target range for the Fed Funds rate [0%, 0.25%]).During  its  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  (FOMC)  monetary  policy  meeting  in  June,  the  Fed  made  its  first 
change, which consisted of a rise in its forecasts for the Fed Funds rate, combined with an upward revision of 
growth and inflation. The Fed prepared the markets by saying it would spell out in November just how it would 
carry on its tapering program. In early November the Fed announced it would cut back its monthly purchases by 
$15 billion, suggesting these would come to an end in June 2022, though the pace of tapering might be adjusted. 
Finally, the mid December meeting of the FOMC confirmed that monetary normalisation would go faster still, with 
tapering occurring at double speed and thus ending in March 2022. The reasons given for the speed-up were the 
breadth  of  the  inflation  and  the  quick  progress  made  towards  full  employment,  despite  a  few  persistent 
disappointments  in  the  participation  rate.  Jerome  Powell  also  stated  that  a  rate  rise  was  possible  before  full 
employment is reached, should inflationary pressures remain concerning. Moreover, the Dot Plot102 signalled a 
more aggressive upward path for the key rate.In  the  eurozone,  while  the  ECB  in  June  also  acknowledged  the  firming  taking  place  and  revised  upward  its 
growth and inflation forecasts, it reiterated the very accommodative and flexible orientation of its monetary policy. 
In December the ECB restated its growth and inflation scenario and presented its monetary strategy.The ECB revised its inflation forecast for 2022 upward (from 1.7% to 3.2%), though much more moderately for 
2023 (from 1.5% to 1.8%), and its 2024 projection of 1.8% remains lower than the 2% target. The ECB seems to 
be saying that inflation will be transitory, largely caused by supply issues having limited effect on core inflation 
(at 1.9% in 2022 and 1.7% in 2023.) The negative impact on growth (revised downward from 4.6% to 4.2% in 
2022)  is  presumed  to  be  moderate  and  brief.  Inflation  should  temporarily  erode  purchasing  power  without 
derailing growth, which is revised upward to 2.9% in 2023.In terms of strategy, the ECB stated that the removal of emergency support would be accompanied by significant 
yet flexible attention to the sovereigns market. The point there is to prevent, on one hand, an over-steepening of 
the yield curve and on the other, any risk of eurozone fragmentation103 The ECB reaffirmed that before its key 
rate  is  raised,  three  conditions  must  be  met:  (1)  Inflation  has  to  reach  the  2%  target  well  before  the  ECB’s 
forecasting horizon; (2) this target must be reached lastingly, out to the forecasting horizon; and (3) the progress 
achieved on core inflation must be sufficiently great that it is compatible with stabilising inflation to its medium-
term target level. Respecting the most current forecasts, these conditions have not been met.Bond markets have kept step with a few major themes: an enthusiastic first quarter buoyed by reflation 
trading, a gloomier second quarter gripped by the reality of the pandemic, and a second half displaying 
lively  growth  yet  also  distinctly  more  troubling  inflation,  fuelling  a  faster  monetary  normalisation 
scenario in the U.S.In the United States, the two-year interest rates104 kept pace with the monetary scenario.  They stayed pegged 
to  a  low  level  (0.17%  on  average)  and  only  started  up,  slowly,  once  monetary  tightening  was  spoken  of 
(September) and then more firmly with the acceleration of tapering late in the year, which they finished at 0.70%, 
for a rise  on  the  year  of 60 basis points. With reflation trading, prompted by more sustained expectations for 
growth  and  inflation,  increasing  vaccination  rates  and  better-than-expected  economic  data,  long  rates  rose 
sharply in the United States, and this rise spread into the eurozone. The U.S. 10-year rate, near 0.90% at the 
start of the year, started to climb and peaked at end-March near 1.75%. Bad news on the public health front then 
tempered  the  enthusiasm,  and  the  bond  markets  took  a  more  conservative  position.  After  that,  starting  in 
September, the idea that accelerating inflation would cause monetary tightening in the U.S. to be more energetic 
than expected once again pushed interest rates higher. The U.S.10-Year rate ended the year at 1.50%, or a rise 
on the year of 60 basis points, was not impacted by the attention focused by the markets on inflation and monetary 
normalisation.102 Clusters of dots showing the opinions of the members of the FOMC as to appropriate future federal funds rates. [the interest rate on fed funds 
deemed appropriate by the Governors] The median now indicates rate hikes of 25 basis points each, happening three times in 2022, three times in 
2023 and twice in 2024. This is a faster and stronger tightening than projected in September, when the first hike was to happen in late 2022 or early 
2023. These rises would put the target fed funds rate between 2% and 2.25% at end-2024.103 Purchases made under the PEPP emergency programme will therefore cease 31 March 2022, and the reinvestment period will be extended until 
year-end 2024, maintaining complete flexibility of purchases as between jurisdictions and asset classes. Assets purchases under the traditional APP 
programme will increase in 2022, from €20 billion per month to €40 billion in Q2, then decrease to €30 billion in Q3 and €20 billion in Q4, then kept 
up as long as necessary to augment the accommodative effects of key rates. Purchases will stop shortly before the increase in key rates.104 All interest rates mentioned refer to State borrowings.46/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021In the eurozone, in sympathy with the first phase of recovery by the U.S. rates, the German 10-year rate (the 
Bund) rose from nearly -0.60% at 1 January to -0.10% in May. While the Fed proved to be tolerant with respect 
to the tightening of financing conditions, a synonym of improvement in economic prospects, the ECB was quick 
to signal that this tightening was premature and unjustified. The Bund then headed downward. Whilst the German 
2-year rate remained virtually level at -0.60% at end-2021 vs. -0.70% at end-2020, the Bund closed the year at -
0.30%, or a rise on the year of 40 basis points. As a result of the ECB’s statements about its process of purchasing 
sovereign securities, the risk premiums offered by France and Italy versus the Bund widened somewhat, with 
those spreads widening 13 and 24 basis points, respectively, but remained narrow, at 35 and 135 basis points, 
respectively. Though the prospect of elections in France does not seem to have affected the spread at this point, 
the Italian spread has been negatively impacted since November by their coming presidential elections.The equity markets, still buoyed by the accommodative financing conditions, despite the normalisations to come, 
and by favourable growth prospects, at least in developed countries, have risen nicely, with the average annual 
rise in the S&P 500, Eurostoxx 50 and CAC 40 indices up +32%, +23%, +27%, respectively. Lastly, after resisting 
stoutly, the euro fell against the dollar given that monetary normalisation was further along in the U.S. than in 
Europe. The euro gained 3.6% against the dollar on average but fell late in the year. At 1.14 in December 2021, 
it lost nearly 7% on the year.47/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 20212022 OUTLOOKOur scenario calls for a slowdown in growth, which ought to remain strong, as well as a slow moderation 
in inflation. Such a picture assumes that demand normalises and that supply chain bottlenecks break 
open.  This  twofold  normalisation  will  allow  inflation  (particularly  core  inflation)  to  slow  and  the 
extraordinary measures of monetary support to be removed unhurriedly and without excessive impact 
on the bond markets.Obviously,  there  is  room  for  error  in  estimating  inflation,  which  could  be  both  higher  and  longer-lasting  than 
expected. While the risk of significant growth in wages and of inflation settling in for a while at a higher level is 
more manifest in the United States, the fear in the eurozone arises rather from an erosion of purchasing power 
that might undermine growth. This, however, is not at present our primary scenario. Furthermore, at least in the 
advanced economies (thanks to high  vaccination rates), the potential variants of the virus seem to hold back 
economic activity only temporarily and without causing disruption or even great interruption in people's behaviour. 
The  uncertainly  produced  by  the  omicron  variant  was  negative  in  the  first  quarter  of  2022  but  positive  in  the 
second quarter of 2022, without upsetting the major thrust of our scenario.In the United States, growth should remain vigorous (3.8% in 2022) before gradually converging with its long-
term trend (2.3% in 2023). It should benefit from strong consumption driven by an improved labour market, from 
an  upward  trend  in  wages  (though  limited  to  the  sectors  most  affected  by  workforce  shortages  and  so  not 
triggering a wage-price spiral) and from the still untapped reservoir of savings, which is a safety net to help absorb 
a quick pick-up in inflation. This is a scenario favourable consumption but also to investment, since businesses 
remain optimistic despite disturbances in the supply-chain and the persistent, though diminishing, lack of labour.The engines that most powerfully contributed to accelerating inflation in 2021 will continue to turn, both 
in the United States and elsewhere, at least during the first-half of 2022:  Brisk, high inflation, particularly 
with the ongoing crisis in natural gas (whose price is extremely volatile but has more or less “stabilised” since 
October);  repercussions  on  retail  prices  of  higher-cost  inputs  (second-order  effects  with  a  maximum  impact 
occurring about three quarters after the jolt to upstream prices); supply-chain problems (including semiconductors 
and containers); and bottlenecks that though less “choking” could continue for the greater part of 2022. In the 
second half-year 2022, assuming a stabilisation in energy prices, the base effects can be expected to be very 
favourable (i.e., a sharp year-on-year decline in energy prices and subsequently in the prices of goods) and the 
disturbances in the value chain should gradually subside.Inflation in the United States, boosted by sharp trends in some specific components (such as the component of 
shelter known as Owner's Equivalent Rent, which does not exist in the eurozone, and more sharply rising wages 
leading to expectations of “third order” effects), is thought to remain very high in the first quarter, peaking near 
7.5% year-on-year and yielding core inflation approaching 6.5%. Total inflation should then turn down, towards 
3% for the 12 months ending 31 December 2022, bringing the yearly average to 5.4% as against 4.7% in 2021.In the eurozone, the strength of the recovery has not yet filled the negative production gap and the exogenous 
inflationary shock does not appear able to alter the scenario of decelerating, if robust, growth, which should be 
4.3% in 2022 and 2.5% in 2023. Aggregate demand, while running up against weak supply (logistical blockages, 
strained  supply  chains,  and  shortages  of  inputs  and  labour),  also  remains  weak  its  rebound.  It  is  just  this 
weakness that leads one to expect restricted wage increases and temporary, if more persistent, higher inflation 
Just as in the U.S., a higher than expected rise in inflation is plainly the primary risk. This would impair growth 
through the erosion of purchasing power, rather than through any wage-price spiral. The possibility of a wage-
price spiral that is of great concern to investors at the moment seems exaggerated.Apart from the upward pressures already noted, inflation in the eurozone will be volatile but greatly influenced by 
technical factors, such as the weighting of components in the price index, the end of the VAT effect in Germany, 
and  country-by-country  pricing  changes  in  energy  contracts.  Total  and  core  inflation  rates  should  settle  on 
average, respectively, at 4.1% (2.4% in December for the year) and 2.4% (1.9% in December).In France, consumer spending should benefit from higher purchasing power despite inflationary pressures. A 
surge in new jobs and lower unemployment rates should create confidence among households, which also enjoy 
surplus  savings  from  the  pandemic  estimated  at  €150  billion.  Investment  will  benefit  from  the  recovery  plan 
announced in the autumn of 2020 and the additional support in the France 2030 plan. Growth is expected to be48/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 20213.9% in 2022. As for inflation, high as it was at the start of the  year, it should fall below 2% by  year-end and 
average 2.6% in 2022.Our scenario assumes high varied efforts at monetary normalisation, which is still preferred to monetary 
tightening.  Depending  on  the  strength  of  the  inflation  experienced  or  feared,  and  on  the  anticipated 
resistance of growth in their respective territories, the central banks are adopting very diverse patterns 
as they withdraw their various accommodations, which were as extraordinary as they were generous.In  the  United  States,  the  officials  of  the  Federal  Reserve  consider  inflation  a  major  risk  but  in  mid-January 
emphasized recovery in business and employment, judging the risk of setting up a wage-price spiral to be low. 
According  to  the  Fed,  inflation  can  be  expected  to  start  slowing  down  in  the  second  half.  The  Fed  began  its 
tapering process, and the markets are now counting on four rises in the fed funds rate in 2022, including 50 basis 
points at the March meeting. We are counting on a target rate of 1% at end-2022.In  the  eurozone,  in  contrast  with  the  forward-moving  Fed,  the  ECB  is  in  no  hurry  and  promises  to  remain 
accommodating and flexible for some time to come, as shown by the thrust of its monetary policy announced in 
December.Monetary normalisation would not be accompanied by heavy strain on bonds. 2022 is expected to be 
divided  into  two  sequences.  After  a  first-half  still  stamped  with  both  high  growth  and  high  inflation, 
providing the right moment for an upward move in interest rates, would come the motif of deceleration 
to bring them down.In the United States, inflation figures have not as yet brought any over-reaction about interest rates. The 10-
year Treasury note rate should thus rise before starting to pull back and settling at 1.35% at end-2022. In the 
eurozone, the way the ECB and the markets assess the risk of inflation and, just as much, the credibility of the 
ECB's diagnosis in the eyes of the markets will be critical. The rise in inflation and in its volatility should increase 
time premiums during the first half of 2022. In sympathy with the ebbing of growth and price pressures, rates 
should  follow  a  downward  slope  in  the  second  half.  The  German  10-year  rate  should  return  to  zero  (or  even 
slightly positive) before falling back to -0.25% at end-2022. As the outlook fades for new recovery measures from 
the ECB, the messaging of the ECB will need to be as subtle as it is convincing to prevent a widening of spreads 
on peripherals. These could, however, widen slightly for a time. The risk premiums offered by France and Italy 
should be, respectively, 25 and 130 basis points above the Bund at end-2022.49/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021Appendix 1 – Specific items, Crédit Agricole Group and

The Net Book Value not re-evaluated corresponds to the shareholders’ equity Group share from which 
the amount of the AT1 issues, the unrealised gains and/or losses on OCI Group share and the pay-out 
assumption on annual results have been deducted. 
NBV per share Net Book Value per share - NTBV per share Net Tangible Book 
Value per share 
One of the methods for calculating the value of a share. This represents the Net Book Value divided by 
the number of shares in issue at end of period, excluding treasury shares.Net Tangible Book Value per share represents the Net Book Value after deduction of intangible assets 
and goodwill, divided by the number of shares in issue at end of period, excluding treasury shares.  
EPS Earnings per Share 
This is the net income Group share, from which the  AT1 coupon has been  deducted, divided by the 
average number of shares in issue excluding treasury shares. It indicates the portion of profit attributable 
to each share (not the portion of earnings paid out to each shareholder, which is the dividend). It may 
decrease, assuming the net income Group share remains unchanged, if the number of shares increases. 
Cost/income ratio 
The  cost/income  ratio  is  calculated  by  dividing  operating  expenses  by  revenues,  indicating  the 
proportion of revenues needed to cover operating expenses.  
Cost of risk/outstandings 
Calculated by dividing the cost of credit risk (over four quarters on a rolling basis) by outstandings (over 
an average of the past four quarters, beginning of the period). It can also be calculated by dividing the 
annualised cost of credit risk for the quarter by outstandings at the beginning of the quarter. Similarly, 
the  cost  of  risk  for  the  period  can  be  annualised  and  divided  by  the  average  outstandings  at  the 
beginning of the period.Since  the  first  quarter  of  2019,  the  outstandings  taken  into  account  are  the  customer  outstandings, 
before allocations to provisions.The calculation method for the indicator is specified each time the indicator is used. 
Doubtful loan 
Defaulting loan. The debtor is considered to be in default when at least one of the following conditions 
has been met:--a payment generally more than 90 days past due, unless specific circumstances point to the fact 
that the delay is due to reasons independent of the debtor’s financial situation;the entity believes that the debtor is unlikely to settle its credit obligations unless it avails itself of 
certain measures such as enforcement of collateral security right.Impaired loan 
Loan which has been provisioned due to a risk of non-repayment. 
Impaired (or doubtful) loan coverage ratio:  
This ratio divides the outstanding provisions by the impaired gross customer outstandings. 
Impaired (or doubtful) loan ratio: 
This ratio divides the gross customer outstandings depreciated on an individual basis, before provisions, 
by the total gross customer outstandings.57/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021Net income Group share 
Net income/(loss) for the financial year (after corporate income tax). Equal to net income Group share, 
less the share attributable to non-controlling interests in fully consolidated subsidiaries. 
Underlying Net income Group share 
The  underlying  net  income  Group  share  represents  the  stated  net  income  Group  share  from  which 
specific items have been deducted (i.e. non-recurring or exceptional items). 
Net income Group share attributable to ordinary shares  
The  net  income  Group  share  attributable  to  ordinary  shares  represents  the  net  income  Group  share 
from which the AT1 coupon has been deducted, including issuing costs before tax. 
RoTE Return on Tangible Equity 
The  RoTE  (Return  on  Tangible  Equity)  measures  the  return  on  tangible  capital  by  dividing  the  Net 
income Group share annualised by the group’s NBV net of intangibles and goodwill. The annualised Net 
income  Group  share  corresponds  to  the  annualisation  of  the  Net  income  Group  share  (Q1x4;  H1x2; 
9Mx4/3) excluding impairments of intangible assets and restating each period of the IFRIC impacts in 
order to linearise them over the year.58/60PRESS RELEASE – Fourth quarter and full-year 2021Disclaimer
