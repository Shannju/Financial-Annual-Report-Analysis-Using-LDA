Financial Accounting Report第六部分·财务会计报告一、审计报告审 计 报 告信会师报字[2020]第ZH30007号齐商银行股份有限公司全体股东：一、审计意见我们审计了齐商银行股份有限公司（以下简称齐商银行）财务报表，包括2019年12月31日的合并及母公司资产负债表，2019年度的合并及母公司利润表、合并及母公司现金流量表、合并及母公司股东权益变动表以及相关财务报表附注。我们认为，后附的财务报表在所有重大方面按照企业会计准则的规定编制，公允反映了齐商银行2019年12月31日的合并及母公司财务状况以及2019年度的合并及母公司经营成果和现金流量。二、形成审计意见的基础我们按照中国注册会计师审计准则的规定执行了审计工作。审计报告的“注册会计师对财务报表审计的责任”部分进一步阐述了我们在这些准则下的责任。按照中国注册会计师职业道德守则，我们独立于齐商银行，并履行了职业道德方面的其他责任。我们相信，我们获取的审计证据是充分、适当的，为发表审计意见提供了基础。三、管理层和治理层对财务报表的责任齐商银行管理层（以下简称管理层）负责按照企业会计准则的规定编制财务报表，使其实现公允反映，并设计、执行和维护必要的内部控制，以使财务报表不存在由于舞弊或错误导致的重大错报。在编制财务报表时，管理层负责评估齐商银行的持续经营能力，披露与持续经营相关的事项（如适用），并运用持续经营假设，除非计划进行清算、终止运营或别无其他现实的选择。治理层负责监督齐商银行的财务报告过程。四、注册会计师对财务报表审计的责任我们的目标是对财务报表整体是否不存在由于舞弊或错误导致的重大错报获取合理保证，并出具包含审计意见的审计报告。合理保证是高水平的保证，但并不能保证按照审计准则执行的审计在某一重大错报存在时总能发现。错报可能由于舞弊或错误导致，如果合理预期错报单独或汇总起来可能影响财务报表使用者依据财务报表作出的经济决策，则通常认为错报是重大的。在按照审计准则执行审计工作的过程中，我们运用职业判断，并保持职业怀疑。同时，我们也执行以下工作：(1)  识别和评估由于舞弊或错误导致的财务报表重大错报风险，设计和实施审计程序以应对这些风险，并获取充分、适当的审计证据，作为发表审计意见的基础。由于舞弊可能涉及串通、伪造、故意遗漏、虚假陈述或凌驾于内部控制之上，未能发现由于舞弊导致的重大错报的风险高于未能发现由于错误导致的重大错报的风险。(2)  了解与审计相关的内部控制，以设计恰当的审计程序，但目的并非对内部控制的有效性发表意见。(3) 评价管理层选用会计政策的恰当性和作出会计估计及相关披露的合理性。(4) 对管理层使用持续经营假设的恰当性得出结论。同时，根据获取的审计证据，就可能导致对齐商银行持续经营能力产生重大疑虑的事项或情况是否存在重大不确定性得出结论。如果我们得出结论认为存在重大不确定性，审计准则要求我们在审计报告中提请报表使用者注意财务报表中的相关披露；如果披露不充分，我们应当发表非无保留意见。我们的结论基于截至审计报告日可获得的信息。然而，未来的事项或情况可能导致齐商银行不能持续经营。(5) 评价财务报表的总体列报、结构和内容（包括披露），并评价财务报表是否公允反映相关交易和事项。(6) 就齐商银行中实体或业务活动的财务信息获取充分、适当的审计证据，以对财务报表发表审计意见。我们负责指导、监督和执行集团审计，并对审计意见承担全部责任。我们与治理层就计划的审计范围、时间安排和重大审计发现等事项进行沟通，包括沟通我们在审计中识别出的值得关注的内部控制缺陷。立信会计师事务所（特殊普通合伙）                        中国注册会计师：中国·上海中国注册会计师：2020年4月10日0 5 3 0 5 4二、审计报表合并资产负债表单位名称：齐商银行股份有限公司                                                                                       单位：人民币元项目                                                                                    2019年12月31日                  2018年12月31日资产：现金及存放中央银行款项

记账本位币本公司采用人民币为记账本位币。(五) 以下注释项目除特别注明之外，金额单位为人民币元。(六) 合并财务报表的编制方法1. 合并范围本公司合并财务报表的合并范围以控制为基础确定，所有子公司（包括本公司所控制的单独主体）均纳入合并财务报表。2. 合并程序本公司以自身和各子公司的财务报表为基础，根据其他有关资料，编制合并财务报表。本公司编制合并财务报表，将整个企业集团视为一个会计主体，依据相关企业会计准则的确认、计量和列报要求，按照统一的会计政策，反映本公司集团整体财务状况、经营成果和现金流量。所有纳入合并财务报表合并范围的子公司所采用的会计政策、会计期间与本公司一致。(七) 现金及现金等价物在编制现金流量表时，将本公司库存现金以及可以随时用于支付的存款确认为现金。将同时具备期限短（从购买日起三个月内到期）、流动性强、易于转换为已知现金、价值变动风险很小四个条件的投资，确定为现金等价物。包括存放中央银行款项（扣除法定存款准备金）、存放同业款项、拆出资金、买入返售金融资产。(八) 外币业务和外币报表折算1. 外币业务外币业务采用交易发生日的即期汇率作为折算汇率将外币金额折合成人民币记账。资产负债表日外币货币性项目余额按资产负债表日即期汇率折算，由此产生的汇兑差额，除属于与购建符合资本化条件的资产相关的外币专门借款产生的汇兑差额按照借款费用资本化的原则处理外，均计入当期损益。2. 外币财务报表的折算资产负债表中的资产和负债项目，采用资产负债表日的即期汇率折算；所有者权益项目除“未分配利润”项目外，其他项目采用发生时的即期汇率折算。利润表中的收入和费用项目，采用交易发生日的即期汇率折算。(九) 买入返售金融资产和卖出回购金融资产款0 6 5 0 6 6买入返售是指按合同或协议规定，以一定的价格向交易对手买入相关资产（包括债券、票据及贷款等），到合同规定日期，再以规定价格返售给对方的合同。买入返售金融资产按买入相关资产时实际支付的金额入账。卖出回购是指按合同或协议规定，以一定的价格将相关资产（包括债券、票据及贷款等）出售给交易对手，到合同规定日期，再以规定价格回购的合同。卖出回购金融资产款按卖出相关资产时实际收到的金额入账。(十) 长期股权投资1. 共同控制、重大影响的判断标准共同控制，是指按照相关约定对某项安排所共有的控制，并且该安排的相关活动必须经过分享控制权的参与方一致同意后才能决策。本公司与其他合营方一同对被投资单位实施共同控制且对被投资单位净资产享有权利的，被投资单位为本公司的合营企业。重大影响，是指对一个企业的财务和经营决策有参与决策的权力，但并不能够控制或者与其他方一起共同控制这些政策的制定。本能够对被投资单位施加重大影响的，被投资单位为本公司联营企业。2. 初始投资成本的确定(1) 企业合并形成的长期股权投资同一控制下的企业合并：公司以支付现金、转让非现金资产或承担债务方式以及以发行权益性证券作为合并对价的，在合并日按照取得被合并方所有者权益在最终控制方合并财务报表中的账面价值的份额作为长期股权投资的初始投资成本。(2) 其他方式取得的长期股权投资以支付现金方式取得的长期股权投资，按照实际支付的购买价款作为初始投资成本。以发行权益性证券取得的长期股权投资，按照发行权益性证券的公允价值作为初始投资成本。3. 后续计量及损益确认方法(1) 成本法核算的长期股权投资公司对子公司的长期股权投资，采用成本法核算。除取得投资时实际支付的价款或对价中包含的已宣告但尚未发放的现金股利或利润外，公司按照享有被投资单位宣告发放的现金股利或利润确认当期投资收益。(2) 权益法核算的长期股权投资对联营企业和合营企业的长期股权投资，采用权益法核算。初始投资成本大于投资时应享有被投资单位可辨认净资产公允价值份额的差额，不调整长期股权投资的初始投资成本；初始投资成本小于投资时应享有被投资单位可辨认净资产公允价值份额的差额，计入当期损益。(十一) 固定资产1. 固定资产确认条件固定资产指为生产商品、提供劳务、出租或经营管理而持有，并且使用寿命超过一个会计年度的有形资产。固定资产在同时满足下列条件时予以确认：(1) 与该固定资产有关的经济利益很可能流入企业；(2) 该固定资产的成本能够可靠地计量。2. 各类固定资产的折旧方法固定资产折旧采用年限平均法分类计提，根据固定资产类别、预计使用寿命和预计净残值率确定折旧率。如固定资产各组成部分的使用寿命不同或者以不同方式为企业提供经济利益，则选择不同折旧率或折旧方法，分别计提折旧。融资租赁方式租入的固定资产，能合理确定租赁期届满时将会取得租赁资产所有权的，在租赁资产尚可使用年限内计提折旧；无法合理确定租赁期届满时能够取得租赁资产所有权的，在租赁期与租赁资产尚可使用年限两者中较短的期间内计提折旧。主要固定资产类别的折旧年限如下：资产类别                                                                                                                                         折旧年限房屋及建筑物电子设备机器设备运输工具及其他(十二) 在建工程30年3年5年5年在建工程项目按建造该项资产达到预定可使用状态前所发生的必要支出，作为固定资产的入账价值。所建造的固定资产在建工程已达到预定可使用状态，但尚未办理竣工决算的，自达到预定可使用状态之日起，根据工程预算、造价或者工程实际成本等，按估计的价值转入固定资产，并按本公司固定资产折旧政策计提固定资产的折旧，待办理竣工决算后，再按实际成本调整原来的暂估价值，但不调整原已计提的折旧额。(十三) 无形资产1. 无形资产的计价方法(1) 公司取得无形资产时按成本进行初始计量；(2) 后续计量在取得无形资产时分析判断其使用寿命。对于使用寿命有限的无形资产，在为企业带来经济利益的期限内按直线法摊销；无法预见无形资产为企业带来经济利益期限的，视为使用寿命不确定的无形资产，不予摊销。2. 无形资产的使用寿命估计情况每期末，对无形资产的使用寿命及摊销方法进行复核。0 6 7 0 6 83. 无形资产减值准备的计提对于使用寿命确定的无形资产，如有明显减值迹象的，期末进行减值测试。对于使用寿命不确定的无形资产，每期末进行减值测试。对无形资产进行减值测试，估计其可收回金额。无形资产的减值损失一经确认，在以后会计期间不再转回。(十四) 长期资产减值长期股权投资、采用成本模式计量的投资性房地产、固定资产、在建工程、无形资产等长期资产，于资产负债表日存在减值迹象的，进行减值测试。减值测试结果表明资产的可收回金额低于其账面价值的，按其差额计提减值准备并计入减值损失。可收回金额为资产的公允价值减去处置费用后的净额与资产预计未来现金流量的现值两者之间的较高者。资产减值准备按单项资产为基础计算并确认，如果难以对单项资产的可收回金额进行估计的，以该资产所属的资产组确定资产组的可收回金额。资产组是能够独立产生现金流入的最小资产组合。(十五) 其他资产1. 长期待摊费用长期待摊费用是指已经支出但应由本期和以后各期负担的分摊期限在一年以上（不含一年）的各项费用。2. 抵债资产抵债资产按取得时的公允价值入帐，公允价值与相关资产账面价值及支付的税费之间的差额计入当期损益。抵债资产处置时，如果取得的处置收入大于抵债资产账面价值，其差额计入营业外收入；如果取得的处置收入小于抵债资产账面价值，其差额计入营业外支出；保管过程中发生的费用直接计入其他业务支出。处置过程中发生的费用，从处置收入中抵减。3. 其他应收款项本公司按照其他应收款的项目和对方单位（个人）进行明细核算。本公司定期分析各项其他应收款项的可收回性，当应收款项的可收回金额低于其账面价值时，计提资产减值准备，并计入当期损益。(十六) 职工薪酬1. 短期薪酬的会计处理方法本公司在职工为本公司提供服务的会计期间，将实际发生的短期薪酬确认为负债，并计入当期损益或相关资产成本。本公司为职工缴纳的社会保险费和住房公积金，以及按规定提取的工会经费和职工教育经费，在职工为本公司提供服务的会计期间，根据规定的计提基础和计提比例计算确定相应的职工薪酬金额。职工福利费为非货币性福利的，如能够可靠计量的，按照公允价值计量。2. 离职后福利的会计处理方法(1) 设定提存计划本公司按当地政府的相关规定为职工缴纳基本养老保险和失业保险，在职工为本公司提供服务的会计期间，按以当地规定的缴纳基数和比例计算应缴纳金额，确认为负债，并计入当期损益或相关资产成本。除基本养老保险外，本公司还依据国家企业年金制度的相关政策建立了企业年金计划。本公司按职工工资总额的一定比例向年金计划缴费，相应支出计入当期损益或相关资产成本。(2) 设定受益计划本公司根据预期累计福利单位法确定的公式将设定受益计划产生的福利义务归属于职工提供服务的期间，并计入当期损益或相关资产成本。3. 辞退福利的会计处理方法本公司在不能单方面撤回因解除劳动关系计划或裁减建议所提供的辞退福利时，或确认与涉及支付辞退福利的重组相关的成本或费用时（两者孰早），确认辞退福利产生的职工薪酬负债，并计入当期损益。(十七) 收入确认收入在相关的经济利益很可能流入本公司且金额能够可靠计量，同时满足以下不同类型收入的其他确认条件时，予以确认。1. 利息收入金融资产的利息收入根据让渡资金使用权的时间和实际利率在计入当期损益。利息收入包括折价或溢价的摊销，当实际利率与合同利率差异不大时，采用合同利率。当一项金融资产或一组类似的金融资产确认减值损失后，确认利息收入所使用的利率为计量减值损失时对未来现金流进行贴现时使用的利率。2. 手续费和佣金收入手续费和佣金收入在提供相关服务时，根据权责发生制的原则确认。资产买卖、或参与第三方进行资产买卖交易（如购买客户贷款、证券，或出售业务）时产生的手续费于相关交易完成时确认。3. 股利收入非上市权益工具投资的股利收入于本公司收取股利权力时确认计入当期损益，计入投资收益。(十八) 递延所得税资产和递延所得税负债对于可抵扣暂时性差异确认递延所得税资产，以未来期间很可能取得的用来抵扣可抵扣暂时性差异的应纳税所得额为限。对于能够结转以后年度的可抵扣亏损和税款抵减，以很可能获得用来抵扣可抵扣亏损和税款抵减的未来应纳税所得额为限，确认相应的递延所得税资产。对于应纳税暂时性差异，除特殊情况外，确认递延所得税负债。0 6 9 0 7 0不确认递延所得税资产或递延所得税负债的特殊情况包括：商誉的初始确认；除企业合并以外的发生时既不影响会计利润也不影响应纳税所得额（或可抵扣亏损）的其他交易或事项。当拥有以净额结算的法定权利，且意图以净额结算或取得资产、清偿负债同时进行时，当期所得税资产及当期所得税负债以抵销后的净额列报。当拥有以净额结算当期所得税资产及当期所得税负债的法定权利，且递延所得税资产及递延所得税负债是与同一税收征管部门对同一纳税主体征收的所得税相关或者是对不同的纳税主体相关，但在未来每一具有重要性的递延所得税资产及负债转回的期间内，涉及的纳税主体意图以净额结算当期所得税资产和负债或是同时取得资产、清偿负债时，递延所得税资产及递延所得税负债以抵销后的净额列报。(十九) 委托业务本公司通常作为受托人在受托业务中为信托机构、其他机构和零售客户管理资产。受托业务中所涉及的资产不属于本公司，因此不包括在本公司财务报表中。委托贷款是指本公司接受委托，由客户（作为委托人）提供资金，由本公司（作为受托人）按照委托人确定的贷款对象、用途、金额、期限、利率而代理发放和监督使用并由本公司协助收回的贷款，风险由委托人承担。本公司进行委托贷款业务只收取手续费，不代垫资金，不承担信用风险。(二十) 债务重组债务重组，是指在债务人发生财务困难的情况下，本公司作为债权人按照其与债务人达成的协议或者法院的裁定作出让步的事项。债务重组的方式主要包括：（一）以资产清偿债务；（二）将债务转为资本；（三）修改其他债务条件；（四）以上三种方式的组合等。以现金清偿债务的，本公司将重组债权的账面余额与收到的现金之间的差额，计入当期损益。本公司已对债权计提减值准备的，先将该差额冲减减值准备，减值准备不足以冲减的部分，计入当期损益。以非现金资产清偿债务的，本公司对受让的非现金资产按其公允价值入账，重组债权的账面余额与受让的非现金资产的公允价值之间的差额，比照以现金清偿债务的规定处理。将债务转为资本的，本公司将享有股份的公允价值确认为对债务人的投资，重组债权的账面余额与股份的公允价值之间的差额，比照以现金清偿债务的规定处理。修改其他债务条件的，本公司将修改其他债务条件后的债权的公允价值作为重组后债权的账面价值，重组债权的账面余额与重组后债权的账面价值之间的差额，比照以现金清偿债务的规定处理。修改后的债务条款中涉及或有应收金额的，本公司不确认或有应收金额，不将其计入重组后债权的账面价值。债务重组采用以现金清偿债务、非现金资产清偿债务、债务转为资本、修改其他债务条件等方式的组合进行的，本公司依次以收到的现金、接受的非现金资产公允价值、债权人享有股份的公允价值冲减重组债权的账面余额，再按照修改其他债务条件的规定处理。四、税项本公司适用的主要税种及税率如下：税种                                                                        税基

Audit ReportTo all the shareholders of QISHANG BANK CO., LTD.:Audit ReportX.H.S.B.Z. [2020] No.ZH30007I. Audit Opinions
We have audited the financial statements of Qishang Bank Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Qishang Bank"), including the consolidated and the parent 
company's balance sheet as of December 31, 2019, the consolidated and the parent company's profit statement, consolidated and the parent company's cash flow 
statement, consolidated and the parent company's statement of shareholders' equity change and notes to relevant financial statements in 2019.In our opinion, the attached financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting standards for enterprises in all major aspects, and fairly 
reflect the consolidated and the parent company's financial condition of Qishang Bank as of December 31, 2019, as well as the consolidated and the parent company's 
operating performance and cash flow in 2019.II. Basis for Forming Audit Opinions
We have conducted audit in accordance with the auditing standards for Chinese Certified Public Accountant (CPA). The part of "CPA's responsibility for the audit of 
financial statements" in the audit report further elaborates our responsibilities under these standards. According to the code of professional ethics for Chinese CPA, we, 
independent of Qishang Bank, have fulfilled other responsibilities in terms of professional ethics. We believe that we have obtained sufficient and appropriate audit 
evidences which provide a basis for our audit opinions.III. Responsibilities of Management and Governance for Financial Statements
The management of Qishang Bank (hereinafter referred to as "the management") is responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the 
provisions of the accounting standards for enterprises to achieve fair reflection and design, implement and maintain necessary internal control, so that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error.In preparing the financial statements, the management is responsible for assessing the capability of Qishang Bank to sustainably operate, disclosing matters 
related to continuous operation (if applicable) and applying the assumption of continuous operation, unless there is a plan for liquidation, termination of operation or 
no other realistic choice.The governance is responsible for supervising the financial reporting process of Qishang Bank.IV. CPA's Responsibility for Audit of Financial Statements
Our goal is to obtain reasonable guarantee on whether the financial statements, as a whole, are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error, and to 
issue the audit report including audit opinions. Reasonable guarantee is a high-level guarantee, but does not ensure that the audit conducted in accordance with the 
auditing standards can be always found when a certain major misstatement exists. Misstatement may be caused by fraud or error. If misstatement, individually or 
collectively, is reasonably expected to possibly affect the economic decisions made by users of financial statements based on the financial statements, it is generally 
considered that misstatement is significant.In the process of audit implementation, we use professional judgment and maintain professional suspicion based on the auditing standards. At the same time,we also do:(1) Identify and assess the risk of material misstatement of financial statements due to fraud or error, design and implement audit procedures to cope with 
these risks, and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidences as the basis for audit opinions. As fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omission, 
misrepresentation or overriding internal control, the risk of failing to discover the material misstatement caused by fraud is higher than that of failing to discover the 
material misstatement caused by error.(2) Understand the audit-related internal control to design appropriate audit procedures, without any purpose of expressing opinions on the effectiveness ofinternal control.(3) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.
(4) Draw a conclusion on the appropriateness of the assumption of continuous operation used by the management. At the same time, we can draw a conclusion 
on whether there is significant uncertainty in the matters or circumstances that may cause significant doubts about the continuous operation capability of Qishang 
Bank in accordance with the audit evidences obtained. If we come to the conclusion that there is significant uncertainty, the auditing standards require us to draw the 
users' attention to the relevant disclosure in the financial statements in the audit report; if the disclosure is not sufficient, we should issue a non-unqualified opinion. 
Our conclusion is based on the information available as of the audit report date. However, the future events or circumstances may cause Qishang Bank's failure in 
continuous operation.(5) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content (including disclosure) of the financial statements, and whether the financial statements fairly reflectrelevant transactions and matters.(6) Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidences on the financial information of entities or business activities in Qishang Bank to express audit opinions on 
the financial statements. We are responsible for the guidance, supervision and implementation of the audit made by the Group and take full responsibility for the 
audit opinions.We communicate with the governance on the planned audit scope, schedule and major audit findings, including noteworthy deficiencies in internal control thatwe have identified in the process of audit implementation.Chinese Certified Public Accountant of BDO (Special general partnership)Certified Public Accountant of China:Shanghai, China SaturdayCertified Public Accountant of China:April 10, 20201 0 7 1 0 8II.

(1) Long-term Equity Investment Formed by Enterprise Merger
Enterprise merger under the same control: If the Company pays cash, transfers non-cash assets or bears debts and issues equity securities as the merger 
consideration, the share of the book value of the owner's equity of the merged party in the final controller's consolidated financial statements on the merger date 
should be taken as the initial investment cost of the long-term equity investment.(2) Long-term Equity Investment Obtained by Other Means
For long-term equity investment obtained by cash payment, the purchase price actually paid should be taken as the initial investment cost. 
For long-term equity investment obtained by issuing equity securities, the fair value of the equity securities issued should be taken as the initial investment cost.3. Subsequent Measurement and Profit and Loss Recognition Method
(1) Long-term Equity Investment Accounted by the Cost Method
The Company's long-term equity investment in its subsidiaries should be accounted by the cost method. In addition to the price actually paid or the cash 
dividends or profits declared but not yet distributed in the consideration when the investment is obtained, the Company should recognize the current investment 
income according to the cash dividends or profits declared and distributed by the invested entity.(2) Long-term Equity Investment Accounted by the Equity Method

and the fair value of the invested entity's identifiable net assets should not be adjusted for long-term equity investment; The difference between the initial investment 
cost and the fair value of the invested entity's identifiable net assets should be included in the profit and loss of the current period.(11) Fixed Assets1. Recognition Conditions of Fixed Assets
Fixed assets refer to tangible assets held for the purpose of producing goods, providing labor services, leasing or operating management, and with a service life ofmore than one accounting year. Fixed assets should be recognized when the following conditions are met simultaneously:(1) The economic benefits related to the fixed assets are likely to flow into the enterprise; 
(2) The cost of the fixed assets can be reliably measured.2. Depreciation Methods of Various Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are accrued in depreciation classifiedly by using the straight-line depreciation method, and the depreciation rate is determined according to the 
category of fixed assets, expected service life and expected net residual value rate. If the service life of each component of the fixed assets is different or economic 
benefits are provided to the enterprise in different ways, different depreciation rates or depreciation methods are selected to accrue depreciation respectively.For the fixed assets rented by means of financing leasing, if the ownership of the leased assets can be reasonably determined to be obtained at the end of 
the leasing term, depreciation should be accrued within the remaining service life of the leased assets; if the ownership of the leased assets cannot be reasonably 
determined to be obtained at the end of the leasing term, they should accrue depreciation in the shorter term between the leasing term and the remaining service life 
of the leased assets.The depreciation periods of main fixed assets are as follows:Category of Assets                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Depreciation PeriodHousing & BuildingsElectronic EquipmentMachinery EquipmentTransportation Facility and Others(12) Construction in Process30 years3 year5 years5 yearsThe project under construction regards the necessary expenditure incurred before the construction of the asset reaches the expected serviceable condition as the 
entry value of fixed assets. If the construction in progress of fixed assets has reached the expected serviceable condition, but the final accounts for completion have 
not yet been handled, the fixed assets should be transferred into according to the estimated value of the project budget, cost or actual cost of the project from the 
date of reaching the expected serviceable condition, and the depreciation of fixed assets should be accrued according to the depreciation policy of fixed assets of the 
Company. After the final accounts for completion have been handled, the original estimated value is adjusted by actual cost, but the depreciation amount that has 
been accrued is not adjusted.(13) Intangible Assets1. Valuation Method of Intangible Assets
(1) Initial measurement is made at cost when the Company obtains intangible assets;
(2) Subsequent measurement
Analyze and judge the service life of intangible assets while being obtained. 
Intangible assets with a limited service life should be amortized according to the straight-line method within the period of bringing economic benefits to theenterprise; intangible assets with an uncertain service life should not be amortized if the period of bringing economic benefits to the enterprise cannot be predicted.1 2 1 1 2 22. Service Life Estimation of Intangible Assets
At the end of each period, review the service life and amortization method of intangible assets.3. Accrual of Impairment Reserve of Intangible Assets
Intangible assets with a definite service life with obvious sign of impairment should conduct an impairment test at the end of the period. 
Intangible assets with an uncertain service life should conduct an impairment test at the end of each period. 
Intangible assets are tested for impairment and the recoverable amount is estimated. 
Once the impairment loss of intangible assets is recognized, it will not be returned in the later accounting period.(14) Long-term Asset ImpairmentFor long-term assets such as long-term equity investment, investment real estate measured by cost mode, fixed assets, construction in progress, intangible assets 
with signs of impairment on the balance sheet date, an impairment test should be conducted. If the result of an impairment test shows that the recoverable amount 
of an asset is lower than its book value, the impairment reserve should be accrued according to the difference and included in the impairment loss. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of the net amount of the fair value of the asset minus the disposal expenses and the present value of the expected cash flow of the asset in 
future. The impairment reserve of assets is calculated and recognized on the basis of a single asset. If it is difficult to estimate the recoverable amount of a single asset, 
the recoverable amount of the asset group to which the asset belongs should be determined. Asset group is the smallest asset portfolio that can generate cash inflow 
independently.(15) Other Assets1. Long-term Unamortized Expenses
Long-term unamortized expenses refer to all expenses that have been paid but should be borne by the current period and later periods with an apportionmentperiod of more than one year (excluding).2. Debt Assets
The debt assets should be entered in the account at the fair value at the time of acquisition, and the difference between the fair value and the book value ofrelevant assets and the taxes paid should be included in the current gains and losses.When disposing debt assets, if the disposal income obtained is greater than the book value of debt assets, the difference should be included in non-operating 
income; if the disposal income obtained is less than the book value of debt assets, the difference should be included in non-operating expenditures; the expenses 
incurred in the custody process should be directly included in other operating expenditures. The expenses incurred in the disposal process should be deducted from 
the disposal income.3. Other Receivables
The Company conducts accounting for details according to the items of other receivables and the other organizations (individuals). The Company regularly 
analyzes the recoverability of other receivables. When the recoverable amount of receivables is lower than its book value, the asset impairment reserve is accrued and 
included in the current gains and losses.(16) Employee Remuneration1. Accounting Handling Method of Short-term Remuneration
During the accounting period when employees provide services to the Company, the Company recognizes the short-term remuneration actually incurred asliabilities and includes it in the current gains and losses or related asset costs.During the accounting period when employees provide services to the Company, for the social insurance premium and housing provident fund paid by theCompany for employees as well as the labor union funds and employee education funds withdrawn according to the regulations, the corresponding employee 
remuneration amount should be calculated and determined according to the specified accrual basis and proportion.For the employee welfare which is non-monetary, if it can be reliably measured, it should be measured at the fair value.2. Accounting Handling Method of After-service Welfare
(1) Defined Withdrawal and Deposit Plan
The Company pays basic pension insurance and unemployment insurance for employees in accordance with relevant regulations of the local government. During 
the accounting period when employees provide services to the Company, the amount payable is calculated according to the payment base and proportion specified 
by the local government, recognized as a liability and included in the current gains and losses or related asset costs.In addition to the basic pension insurance, the Company has also established an enterprise annuity plan in accordance with relevant policies of the national 
enterprise annuity system. The Company should pay to the annuity plan in a certain proportion of the total wages of employees, and the corresponding expenditures 
should be included in the current gains and losses or related asset costs.(2) Defined Benefit Plan
According to the formula determined by the expected cumulative welfare unit method, the Company attributes the welfare obligations arising from the definedbenefit plan to the period during which employees provide services, and includes them in the current gains and losses or related asset costs.(3) Accounting Handling Method of Dismissal Welfare
When the Company cannot unilaterally withdraw the dismissal welfare due to the termination of labor relations plan or reduction proposal, or recognize the costs 
or expenses related to the reorganization involving the payment of dismissal welfare (whichever is earlier), the Company should recognize the employee remuneration 
liabilities arising from the dismissal welfare and include them in the current gains and losses.(17) Revenue RecognitionRevenue is recognized when relevant economic benefits are likely to flow into the Company and the amount can be reliably measured, and other recognitionconditions of the following different types of revenue are met.1. Interest Income
The interest income of financial assets should be included in the current gains and losses according to the time of transferring the right to use funds and the 
actual interest rate. Interest income includes the amortization of discount or premium. When there is no significant difference between the actual interest rate and the 
contract interest rate, the latter is selected.When impairment loss is recognized for a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets, the interest rate used to recognize the interest income is the interestrate used to discount the future cash flow when measuring the impairment loss.2. Handling Fee and Commission Income
When providing relevant services, the handling fee and commission income should be recognized according to the principle of the accrual system. 
The handling fees incurred in asset trading, or participating in asset trading transactions (such as purchase of customer loans, securities, or sale business) by thethird parties should be recognized at the completion of relevant transactions.3. Dividend Income
The dividend income of non-listed equity instrument investment should be recognized in the current gains and losses and included in the investment incomewhen the Company receives the dividend power.(18) Deferred Income Tax Assets and Deferred Income Tax LiabilitiesFor the deductible temporary difference, the deferred income tax assets should be recognized to the extent of the taxable income that is likely to be obtained1 2 3 1 2 4in the future to offset the deductible temporary difference. For deductible loss and tax deduction that can be carried forward in the later years, the corresponding 
deferred income tax assets should be recognized to the extent of the future taxable income that is likely to be obtained to offset the deductible loss and tax deduction.For taxable temporary differences, recognize deferred income tax liabilities, except for special circumstances. 
Special circumstances of not recognizing deferred income tax assets or deferred income tax liabilities include: initial recognition of goodwill; other transactions ormatters that do not affect accounting profit or taxable income (or deductible loss) at the time of occurrence other than enterprise merger.When the Company has the legal right to settle at a net amount and intends to settle at a net amount or obtain assets and pay off liabilities, the current incometax assets and current income tax liabilities should be presented at the net amount after offset.When the Company has the legal right to settle the current income tax assets and current income tax liabilities at a net amount, and the deferred income tax 
assets and deferred income tax liabilities are related to the income tax levied by the same tax collection and management authority on the same tax entity or different 
tax entities, but in future, the taxpaying entity intends to settle the current income tax assets and liabilities with a net amount, or obtain assets and pay off liabilities 
during each period when significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities are transferred back, the deferred income tax assets and liabilities should be presented 
at the net amount after offset.(19) Entrusted BusinessThe Company generally manages assets for trust institutions, other institutions and retail customers as the entrustee in entrusted business. The assets involved inentrusted business do not belong to the Company, so they are not included in the financial statements of the Company.Entrusted loan refers to the loan that is entrusted by the Company, funded by the customer (as the entrustor), issued and supervised by the Company (as the 
entrustee) according to the loan object, purpose, amount, term and interest rate determined by the entrustor, and recovered with the assistance of the Company. The 
risk should be borne by the entrustor. The Company only charges handling fee for entrusted loan business and does not advance funds on behalf of others and bear 
the credit risk.(20) Debt RestructuringDebt restructuring refers to the matters that the Company, as the creditor, makes concessions in accordance with the agreement reached with the debtor or the 
court decision in case of financial difficulties of the debtor. The ways of debt restructuring mainly include: (1) paying off debts with assets; (2) converting debts into 
capital; (3) modifying other debt conditions; (4) combination of the above three, etc.If the debt is paid off in cash, the Company should include the difference between the book balance of the restructured right of credit and the cash received in the 
current gains and losses. If the Company has made impairment reserve for the right of credit, the difference should be offset against the impairment reserve first, and 
the part that the impairment reserve is insufficient for offset should be included in the current gains and losses.Where non-cash assets are used to pay off debts, the Company should enter the transferred non-cash assets in the account at their fair value, and the difference 
between the book balance of the restructured right of credit and the fair value of the transferred non-cash assets should be handled in accordance with the regulations 
of paying off debts in cash.Where the debt is converted into capital, the Company should recognize the fair value of shares as the investment for the debtor, and the difference between thebook balance of the restructured right of credit and the fair value of shares should be handled in accordance with the regulations of paying off the debt in cash.In case of modification of other debt conditions, the Company should take the fair value of the right of credit after modification of other debt conditions as the 
book value of the restructured right of credit, and the difference between the book balance and the book value of the restructured right of credit should be handled 
according to the regulations of paying off the debt in cash. If the modified debt terms involve contingent receivables, the Company will not recognize the contingent 
receivables and include them in the book value of the restructured right of credit.Where debt restructuring is done in a combination of paying off debts in cash, paying off debts in non-cash assets, converting debts into capital and modifying 
other debt conditions, the Company should, in turn, offset the book balance of the restructured right of credit by the received cash, the fair value of non-cash assets 
and the fair value of shares enjoyed by creditors, and then make disposal in accordance with the regulations of modifying other debt conditions.IV.
