《 / 》冯瑞云棉布混合媒介
140 x 150 厘米今年年度报告封面的设计灵感源自冯瑞云女士的画作《/》。冯女士是新加坡拉萨尔艺术学院的一名讲师，此幅画作荣获
了 2018 年“大华银行年度绘画大赛（新加坡）”资深画家组金奖。作品中的“/”既可解读为左右之间的二元选择，也代表着坚决果断的凌厉一击。它反映了画家在创作过程中时而流畅、
时而顿挫的运笔，诠释了时间或流逝、或凝固的立意。通过绘画技巧和媒介的结合，她的落笔展现出了力之势、动之韵和
流转之美。这幅画作与大华银行的经营理念不谋而和。面对抉择，我们审时度势，果断决策，力求为企业成长和社会发展取得最佳成果。
大华银行对艺术的大力支持，是我们致力为营运所在的社区创造可持续价值这一理念的延续和扩展。“大华银行年度绘画

Chairman’s Statement今年年度报告的封面画作提醒我们，只有全方位考量我们运营所在
的环境，才能适时出手，正中目标。这与大华银行审慎、专注及灵
活的商业眼光不谋而合。当我们创新性解决方案的时候。我们不放
过任何一个机遇，但我们会审视其中的风险和回报。我们在构建可
持续的业务网络的同时，不断权衡创新与稳定增长两者之间的关系。我们的发展观建立在我行诚信、进取、齐心和担当这四个历经时间
考验的价值观之上。他们是撑起大华银行 80 余年发展的基石，也
指导着我们每一个决定和每一项行动。在价值观的引导下，我们坚
持 “以客户为中心”，拓展我们的区域业务网络，运用科技和数字
化解决方案让银行服务更简单、更智能和更安全，坚持面向未来的
战略投资。我们的策略核心就是维持强健的资产负债表，在不同的
经济周期起伏中仍能有力支持客户的发展。2018 年财务业绩
2018 年，我行营业收入同比增长了 4.9% 至人民币 12.3 亿元，主要得
益于净利息收入的双位数增长。我行净利息收入同比增长 21.5% 至
人民币 9.8 亿元，手续费及佣金净收入同比增长 13.3% 至人民币 1.3 亿。
由于我行坚持在华的长期投资和发展，我们持续加大对人才和产品

所增长，营业支出同比上升了 14.1% 至人民币 10 亿元。由于资产质
量保持稳定，减值损失计提下降了 60.3% 至人民币 0.5 亿元。2018
年税后净利润为人民币 1.5 亿元，较 2017 年同比增长 10.7%。The painting on the cover of this year’s Annual Report is 
a  reminder  to  us  all  that  we  must  consider  carefully  the 
environment  in  which  we  operate  and  the  forces  at  play 
before striking (/) at the right moment. It resonates with 
UOB’s  stance  of  staying  disciplined,  focused  and  nimble, 
as  we  seek  and  implement  innovative  solutions  amid  an 
increasingly digital and disrupted world. We consider the 
risks and rewards of any given opportunity. We also balance 
innovation and growth with stability in building our franchise 
sustainably.Our  discipline  is  derived  from  our  time-tested  values  of 
Honour, Enterprise, Unity and Commitment. They are the 
foundation on which we have built UOB over eight decades 
and  have  been  guiding  the  decisions  we  make  and  the 
actions we take. They underpin our unwavering focus on the 
fundamentals in our business: always putting our customers 
at  the  centre,  building  on  our  regional  infrastructure, 
harnessing technology and digital solutions to make banking 
simpler, smarter and safer and making strategic investments 
for the future. Core to our approach is maintaining a strong 
balance sheet so that we can support our customers through 
economic cycles.2018 Financial Performance
In 2018, we achieved operating income of RMB1,229.5 million, 
an increase of 4.9 per cent from last year, mainly driven by 
double-digit growth of net interest income. Our net interest

million. Meanwhile, net fee and commission income rose up 
13.3 per cent from a year ago to RMB 130.3 million. Operating 
expenses grew by 14.1 per cent to RMB997.0 million, largely 
driven by higher staff costs and business–related expenses as 
we invested in talent and product capabilities to improve our 
customer experience. This reflects our continued commitment 
to the long-term investment and growth in China. Impairment 
charges decreased by 60.3 per cent to RMB53.2 million. We 
registered net profit after tax of RMB150.5 million, an increase of 
10.7 per cent from 2017.6大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告我行的资产质量保持稳定，不良贷款率从上年末的 0.8% 小幅下降至

GDP 增长。中国的进出口总值达 30.5 万亿元，再创历史新高。而伴
随“一带一路”倡议的深入推进和“粤港澳大湾区”建设的开展，
投资贸易活动也将进一步活跃。在金融消费领域，不断壮大的中产
阶层也带来了可观的财富管理需求。预见到客户的业务需求和发展宏图，我们也不断加大长期投入，以
夯实业务网络和增强跨境业务能力。在中国，自从三十多年前在华
建立北京办事处开始，我们就坚持耐心地、稳步地深耕本地市场。
2018 年是大华银行（中国）开业十周年。为进一步坚定在华发展承诺，
我们为中国总部——大华银行大厦举行了开幕仪式，这是上海陆家
嘴唯一整栋由外资银行参与设计并投资购买的甲 A 级写字楼。大华银行在区域广泛的业务网络和本地业务能力，令我们在市场竞
争中占据有利位置，也为业务的可持续发展打下了深厚的基础。我

International Credit Rating both giving a stable outlook.Deepening our Local Presence 
Despite macro headwinds in the near term, we continue to 
see the long-term potential of Asia.China’s  economy  shows  strong  resilience  as  the  country 
recorded 6.6 per cent GDP growth in 2018 despite downward 
pressure. China's foreign trade reached an historic high of 
RMB30.5 trillion which is expected to grow as the country 
continues to tap connectivity initiatives such as Belt and 
Road Initiative (BRI) and the Greater Bay Area (GBA) scheme. 
On the consumer front, China’s growing mass affluent class is 
driving demand for more wealth management services.In  anticipating  our  customers’  needs  and  aspirations,  we 
have  been  making  long-term  investments  in  our  regional 
infrastructure  and  connectivity  capabilities.  In  China, 
we  have  been  patiently  and  prudently  deepening  our 
presence  for  more  than  three  decades  since  we  set  up 
the first representative office in Beijing. 2018 marked the 
tenth  anniversary  of  UOB  (China).  As  part  of  reaffirming 
our  commitment  to  China,  we  opened  the  Bank’s  new 
headquarters. We are the first foreign bank in China to have 
a  Grade-A  office  building  in  Shanghai’s  Lujiazui  Financial 
District.Our regional scale and local market expertise in China and 
Southeast Asia give us a competitive edge and serve as a 
robust foundation for sustainable growth. We can tap the 
region’s growth drivers, manage risks, and deliver a seamless

make  art  accessible  to  all.  In  2018,  we  opened  the  UOB 
Art Gallery at UOB Plaza in Shanghai in conjunction with 
the  official  opening  of  our  headquarters  building.  The 
inaugural exhibition, themed the Art of Banking, reflected 
our  distinctive  approach  to  sustainable  growth.  We  also 
conducted many community events with children and our 
UOB Painting of the Year artist alumni to help encourage 
awareness,  appreciation  and  development  of  art  in  our 
communities.10大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告2019 年展望2019 年，市场波动将进一步加剧。中美贸易摩擦、地缘政治格局的
演变、美国财政和货币政策的涓滴效应以及中国经济发展速度的放
缓，都为全球经济发展带来了不稳定因素。尽管面临短期的不确定
性，然而展望前方，我们仍可预见亚洲正在释放长期发展的潜力。
区域间互联互通以及商贸往来的加强，合理的人口结构，不断崛起
的新富阶层都为经济增长提供了源源动力。我们将利用不断强化的
本地布局，一体化的区域网络，扎实的业务专长和领先的市场地位，
帮助客户发掘其中所蕴含的商机。我们在跨境业务领域和数字化业
务领域的长远投资，也有助我们更好把握机遇，趁势而上。今年的年报封面提醒我们，不管在商业领域，还是在日常生活，我
们不会总是面对简单的二元抉择。在这种情况下，我们就必须让心
中的道德准则作为行动的指南。对于大华银行来说，这个道德准则
就是我行的价值观，这一价值观令我们放眼大局，平衡风险和回报。这样的大局观对于我们为股东创造可持续价值来说至关重要。我们
相信只有做到“以客户为中心”并且坚守我行的价值观，才能保持
基业长青。在此，我要感谢大华银行（中国）董事会，尤其要向已卸任的非执
行独立董事曾之杰先生致谢，感谢他过往 8 年的支持与贡献；也欢
迎非执行独立董事吴玉华先生加入大华银行（中国）董事会。同时，
我也要感谢管理层和我行所有的同事们。最后，我要感谢我行所有的客户，对大华银行（中国）长期以来所
给予的信任和支持。黄一宗大华银行（中国）有限公司董事长
2019 年 3 月Looking Ahead
Market volatility is likely to remain elevated in 2019. The 
impact of ongoing US-China trade tensions and geopolitics, 
the trickle-down effect of US fiscal and monetary policy 
settings and concerns over a China slowdown are among 
the factors posing risks to global economic growth. Despite 
near-term uncertainties, we see the long-term potential of 
Asia through the increased connectivity and intra-regional 
business flows, favourable demographics and rising affluence 
which underpin economic growth. We will continue to draw 
upon our strengthened local presence, integrated regional 
network, deep knowledge and strong position in the region 
to help our customers benefit from the opportunities that 
arise.   Our  future-focused  investments  in  connectivity 
capabilities and digital solutions also ensure we are well-
positioned for growth.The  title  of  this  year’s  Annual  Report  reminds  us  that  in 
business, as in life, we are not always presented with binary 
choices to make. Under such circumstances, we need to be 
guided by our own moral compass. At UOB, this compass is 
one based on our values and enables us to strike the right 
balance between risk and reward, with the long-term view in 
mind.This stance is critical to UOB creating sustainable value for 
our stakeholders. We believe that by putting the customer 
at the centre of all that we do and by acting consistently 
in accordance with our values, we will continue to build a 
sustainable business for generations to come.Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the UOB (China) Board and express our 
appreciation to Mr Zeng Zhijie for his contributions over the 
past eight years as non-executive and independent director 
of the Board. I  welcome Mr Wu Yuhua in his first year as 
a  non-executive  and  independent  director.  My  gratitude 
also goes to my Management team and the wider family of 
colleagues in China.To our valued customers, without whom UOB (China) would 
not  be  what  it  is  today,  I  thank  you  for  your  continued 
confidence in and support of UOB (China).Wee Ee CheongChairman

Group is Asia's leading venture lending firm.Commercial Banking
In year 2018, Commercial Banking continued to fulfil clients’ 
changing  financial  needs  as  they  expand  into  the  region 
and to tap the Group’s network to provide comprehensive 
banking  solutions.  As  a  result,  we  achieved  double-digit 
growth  during  the  year.  Our  total  revenue  and  operating 
profit increased by 26 per cent and 34 per cent respectively. 
Through maximizing business resources, we also lowered our 
cost-to-income ratio by three per cent.By  sharpening  our  industry  focus  and  growing  in-depth 
industry  knowledge,  we  were  able  to  grow  our  client 
portfolio  and  deepen  our  relationships  with  existing 
customers. We also built multiple client acquisition channels. 
For  example,  by  l  offering  buyer's  credit  to  key  clients  , 
we were able to provide trade financing and supply chain 
financing solutions to their trade and value chain partners 
across the region. We also improved the account receivable 
financing process and launched dealer financing products. 
These approaches increased our share of clients from target 
industries and helped us reduce credit risks.Through  UOB’s  Foreign  Direct  Investment  (FDI)  Advisory 
Unit, we have been at the forefront of facilitating clients’ 
cross-border  expansion.  As  part  of  its  capabilities,  the 
Unit has built an ecosystem of strategic partners including 
government  agencies,  trade  and  industry  associations 
and  professional  service  providers  to  promote  regional 
connectivity. Through UOB Group’s nine FDI Centres in Asia, 
including one in China, the unit has facilitated more than 
2,100 companies in their overseas expansion. Thirty per cent 
of these clients are Chinese companies venturing into the 
Southeast Asia. In 2018, the Unit increased the number of the 
Chinese companies it assisted to expand overseas by about 
50 per cent compared with the previous year.During the year, we also collaborated with Innoven Capital1 
to offer banking services to start-up companies in China.Building on our progress in 2018, Commercial Banking will 
standardise and scale up our solutions to provide a diversified 
range of products and services of cash management, import 
and export financing, currency swap and FDI beyond direct 
financing. Our endeavours to improve product portfolio and 
client engagement will help us acquire more clients in target 
sectors including consumer goods, technology, media and 
telecommunication (TMT) and industrials.The  regional  connectivity  initiatives  including  Belt  and 
Road Initiative (BRI) is set to continually open up business 
opportunities for our clients. Particularly, the Greater Bay 
Area2, which is expected to be one of the fastest-growing 
economic  clusters  in  China.  Our  FDI  Advisory  Unit  will 
continue connecting our clients to such opportunities to 
regionalise their business.2. The Greater Bay Area is China’s national scheme aiming to link Hong Kong,

帮助境外企业走进来。例如，在集团与中国企业银行团队通力合作下，
大华银行成功帮助某国内大型国有企业联合承销发行 24 亿美金分期
高级无担保债券，为其在海外发展拓宽资金来源；同时大华银行作

In 2018, Corporate Banking forged ahead steadily against the 
backdrop of changing market and economy. We achieved 
business growth both in new client acquisitions and profit.We  continued  to  build  up  traditional  banking  business 
through providing regional-integrated products and services. 
Capitalising on the Group’s regional network, we actively 
explored overseas business opportunities and strengthened 
collaboration with UOB regional teams to better facilitate 
clients’ cross-border needs.For  example,  UOB,  as  the  mandated  joint  book  runner 
(JBR)/joint  lead  manager  (JLM)  supported  a  large  state-
owned  enterprise  to  issue  USD2.4  billion  multi-tranche 
senior unsecured notes to finance the company’s overseas 
development.  And,  UOB,  as  the  sole  coordinator  and 
mandated lead arranger, offered a Chinese large corporate 
client with a USD150 million three-year club loan.We improved our competitive edge by sharpening our sector 
expertise and connecting to our client’s value chain Based 
upon our deep understanding on the targeted sectors, we 
are able to provide clients tailor-made financial solutions 
and expand our client portfolio across their value chain. In 
2018,  we  deepened  relationship  with  clients  in  advanced 
manufacturing sector and food, agriculture and consumer 
goods sector. We also enhanced our client coverage of oil 
and  gas sector as well as  construction and infrastructure 
sector. We also upgraded banking product offerings to real 
estate  and  hospitality  sector  and  technology,  media  and 
telecommunication (TMT) sector.30 大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告金融机构部2018 年，得益于大华银行集团在香港、新加坡及其他东南亚地区强

构不断增长的业务需求和海外金融机构的业务流入中国。金融机构部的三个团队分别专注于银行、非银行金融机构和房地产
基金，为客户提供量身定制的综合解决方案，以满足他们在境内外
和跨境的不同业务需求。这些定制的解决方案包括：双边贷款、银
团贷款、黄金租赁、债券发行、贸易融资、现金管理、逆回购和综
合避险方案等，满足了客户不同的流动性和风险管理要求。2018 年
我们的客户数量较上一年增长 12%，业务收入增长 95%。此外，我们还与机构银行的其他部门密切合作，为企业客户的贸易
融资、担保业务等提供支持。此外，通过与环球金融部密切合作，
促进与上海黄金交易所和上海清算所等交易所客户的关系，向大华
银行（中国）客户提供更多前端财资产品服务。在继续推动与重点客户在境内业务合作外，我部还依托集团在区域
内强大的金融网络，积极支持客户海外业务发展。随着国家“一带
一路”倡议向纵深推进，金融机构部也进一步深入与中资银行的合
作伙伴关系，帮助企业把握跨境发展机遇。2018 年，我行就与两位
长期合作伙伴上海浦东发展银行和中信银行股份有限公司在“一带
一路”框架下，分别签订了战略合作备忘录。在金融机构部的努力下，我行在银行间市场首次发行了三年期“债
券通”金融债，以满足我行日益增长的中期人民币资金需求。结构贸易与商品融资2018 年，结构贸易与商品融资部继续致力于为核心客户提供结构贸

时减低利率和汇率风险，同时配合我行的资金管理方案提高客户的
资金使用效率。在上海自贸区融资结构成功经验的基础上，我部不
断拓展客户群 。今年，我部贸易收入较上年度显著增长 274%，贷款利息收入增长
116%，及现金管理收入增长 26%。Financial Institutions Group (FIG) 
In  2018,  backed  by  UOB’s  strong  regional  network,  FIG 
continued  to  expand  our  team  and  expertise  to  support 
Chinese  and  regional  financial  institutions  (FIs)  to  tap 
increasing cross-border business flows.Our three FIG teams, specialising in banks, non-bank financial 
institutions and property funds, provided our clients with 
tailored and comprehensive onshore and cross-border financial 
solutions. These financial solutions included bilateral loans, 
syndicated loans, gold leasing, bond issuance, FI trade finance, 
cash management, reverse repos and hedging solutions to 
meet the liquidity and risk management needs of our FI clients. 
As a result, in 2018 FIG expanded its client base by 12 per cent 
while business revenue grew by 95 per cent year-on-year.Working closely with other Wholesale Banking segments, FIG 
also provided trade finance and guarantee services to corporate 
clients. In addition, FIG collaborated with our Global Markets 
team  to  strengthen  relationships  with  business  partners 
including the Shanghai Gold Exchange and Shanghai Clearing 
House to develop advanced treasury products for our clients.We  continued  to  forge  relationships  with  key  FI  clients 
to  support  their  business  growth  in  China  and  leveraged 
our regional network to facilitate their expansion as they 
internationalise their business. We also deepened partnerships 
and collaborations with leading Chinese banks to help more 
companies seize opportunities arising from the BRI. In 2018, 
UOB (China) signed MOUs with long-standing FI partners 
namely Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and China CITIC 
Bank Corporation Limited respectively to jointly tap on BRI 
opportunities. Under the MOU, our Chinese partners and their 
clients are able to connect with UOB’s business ecosystem and 
resources as they expand into Southeast Asia.With the solid support from FIG, UOB (China) issued its first 
three-year onshore medium-term note denominated in renminbi 
to provide new long-term funding resources to the Bank.Structured Trade and Commodity Finance 
In 2018, Structured Trade and Commodity Finance remained 
focused  on  providing  structured  trade  solutions  to  our 
cross-function  and  regional  clients.  We  offered  them  a 
comprehensive suite of trade products to help them mitigate 
interest  and  currency  risks.  We  also  supported  them  to 
enhance  cash  efficiency  through  our  cash  management 
solutions. We also managed to broaden our client base by 
applying our experience in back-to-back trade financing in the 
Shanghai Free Trade Zone to new clients with cross-border 
needs.During the year, we achieved trade income growth of 274 
per cent over the previous year, a 116 per cent increase in

In  2018,  Transaction  Banking  achieved  strong  revenue 
growth of 42 per cent over the previous year. This growth 
is attributed to a  significant 45 per cent increase in cash 
management  income  and  36  per  cent  increase  in  trade 
income.We  remained  committed  to  investing  in  our  product 
capabilities in the areas of cash management, trade finance 
and  financial  supply  chain  management.  Our  investment 
enabled us to provide our clients with end-to-end solutions, 
and to support their evolving business needs and expansion 
plans within and across borders.During the year, we introduced a one-stop site to facilitate 
easy downloading of the full set of account opening forms. 
We  also  streamlined  invoice  financing  processes  and

大华银行（中国）薪酬管理
薪酬政策与管理
大华银行（中国）薪酬政策的目标是提供具有市场竞争力的薪酬水
平使得银行能够合理并较为恰当地吸引、保留和激励与本行组织文
化、价值观相契合，与岗位胜任力相匹配的高素质人才。同时，该
薪酬政策体现了本行将薪酬支付与银行的业绩、长期利益以及风险
管控有效的结合。该薪酬政策适用于本行全体正式员工。根据本行薪酬政策的规定，员工的薪酬水平主要与集团、员工所在
的部门、及个人的绩效考核结果相挂钩。绩效考核的目标设置则体
现了本行对该部门及员工个人对于风险管控及长中短期绩效的要求
和期望。此外，本行从事合规和风险管理部门员工的薪酬水平与其
所监督的业务条线的绩效水平相独立。本行可变薪酬包括绩效奖金以及限制型股票，该支付方式可以合理
地将薪酬与本行的绩效以及与当前和未来的风险挂钩。根据中国银
行保险监督管理委员会颁布的《商业银行稳健薪酬监管指引》，本
行的高级管理人员以及对风险有重要影响岗位上的员工有部分可变
薪酬将被递延支付。根据本行薪酬递延框架，可变薪酬的递延比例
原则上为 40%，该递延支付工具以限制型股票或递延奖金（如适用）
的方式进行操作。为了更好地发挥薪酬在银行治理中的积极作用，大华银行（中国）
已成立了提名及薪酬委员会（以下简称“委员会”），该委员会由
四名董事组成，其中委员会主席由独立董事担任。报告期内，委员
会共召开会议 1 次。董事、监事和高级管理人员薪酬
2018 年本行向提名及薪酬委员会成员支付的董事费总计为人民币
608,000 元，向监事支付的监事费总计为人民币 400,000 元。截至 2018 年 12 月 31 日，本行共 23 名高级管理人员及对风险有重要
影响岗位上的员工，在 2018 年我行对其支付的薪酬总额为人民币
63,372,041 元，其中固定薪酬总额为人民币 41,055,244 元，可变薪酬
总额为人民币 22,316,797 元。本行目前无递延薪酬、留存薪酬的显性调整和隐性调整。54大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告Remuneration
Remuneration Policy and Management
The  remuneration  policy  of  UOB  (China)  aims  to  provide 
competitive remuneration package and ensure the bank is 
able to appropriately attract, retain and motivate high quality 
talents who not only fit the Bank’s culture and share the 
same values but also meet the competencies the positions 
require.  Meanwhile,  the  remuneration  policy  outlines 
how  our  remuneration  entitlement  links  to  the  Bank’s 
performance, long-term benefits and risk management. This 
remuneration policy applies to all of the full-time employees 
with the Bank.According to the Bank's remuneration policy, the employee’s 
salary  is  mainly  linked  to  individual  performance  and 
the  performance  of  UOB  Group  and  the  function  the 
employee  works  within.  The  performance  target  setting 
clearly  shows  the  requirements  and  expectations  of  the 
Bank  for  risk  management  and  long-term  and  short-term 
performance of the function and the individual. In addition, 
the compensation review of the employees who are taking 
compliance and risk management’s roles is independent with 
the performance of the business lines they supervise.The  Bank's  variable  pay  includes  performance  bonus  and 
restricted shares, which links the staff variable pay to the 
Bank's  performance  and  current  and  future  risks.  In  line 
with the Supervisory Guidelines on Sound Compensation 
in Commercial Banks issued by China Banking and Insurance 
Regulatory Commission, senior management and employees 
whose roles have material impacts on the Bank’s risk exposure 
would have a portion of their variable pay deferred. Under 
the Bank’s deferral framework, in principle 40% deferral rate 
will be applied to the variable pay. This deferral will be in the 
form of deferred shares or deferred cash (where applicable).To  maintain  sound  corporate  governance  practices  and 
an  effective  remuneration  management,  UOB  (China)  has 
established  a  Nominating  and  Remuneration  Committee 
(NRC), which consists of four Board Directors. The chairman 
of  NRC  is  an  independent  director.  During  the  reporting 
period, the committee held one meeting in total.Compensation for Board Directors, Supervisors and Senior 
Management
In 2018, the Bank paid a total of RMB608,000 director fee 
to the members of NRC, and paid a total of RMB400,000 
supervisor fee to the supervisors.As of 31 December, 2018, there are total 23 senior executives 
whose  roles  have  material  impacts  on  the  Bank’s  risk 
exposure. The total compensation for these executives in 
2018 was RMB63,372,041, including RMB41,055,244 fixed pay 
and RMB22,316,797 variable pay.The Bank currently has no explicit and/or implicit adjustments 
to the deferred pay and/or remained pay.内部控制和内部审计情况
内部控制
大华银行 ( 中国 ) 依据中国的政策法规和监管要求并结合大华银行集
团的具体实践，逐步建立、完善适应银行业务发展的内部控制体系
和制度，并确保其始终具备前瞻性和可实践性。我行董事会通过定期召开会议及相关内部委员会讨论，审阅各项风
险管理和分析报告、经营情况与预算执行情况报告和内部审计报告。
同时，结合同业经验交流等多种形式，全面评估银行内部控制体系。我行现行的内部控制体系和制度在改善内部控制环境方面体现了较
好的完整性、合理性和有效性，包括但不限于增强风险识别、监测
和评估能力、提高风险控制措施、完善信息交流与反馈机制、强化
监督评价与纠正机制。该内控体系和制度能够对国家法律法规和银
行规章制度的贯彻执行提供合理保证。内部审计
我行设立了独立的审计监督机构——内部审计部。内部审计部直接
向董事会下设的审计委员会和大华银行集团审计部报告工作；在行
政层面上，内部审计部向我行行长兼首席执行官汇报工作。内部审计部的主要职责为通过提供独立及客观的内部审计服务和其
他增值服务，协助董事会和管理层履行其法律和管理职责，旨在促
进我行运营活动中内部控制和风险管理的合理性和有效性。内部审
计部依据其系统的、严格的方法论，评估我行内部财务控制、运营
和合规控制的有效性，同时改善我行风险管理、控制与治理流程的
有效性，从而帮助我行实现其经营和管理目标。内部审计部遵照中国银行保险监督管理委员会颁布的《关于金融机
构内部审计的监管要求》，以及国际内部审计师协会制定的《准则
与指引》履行职责。每年度，内部审计部依据“风险导向”的审计
方法制定审计计划和审计频率，并根据对被审计对象的固有风险、
内控有效性的评估结果、管理层关注和监管热点确定审计项目的优
先次序以及审计范围。审计内容覆盖总行和分支机构的业务发展和
运营情况以及信息系统基础架构和应用程序的建设及运用情况等。所有内部审计报告将被呈报至审计委员会。对于重大审计发现，内
部审计部将提请审计委员会成员予以关注。同时，严密监督管理层
针对内部审计、外部审计以及监管机构所提出任何的需整改事项所
采取的后续行动的实施情况，并对整改结果予以独立评价。Internal Control and Internal Audit
Internal Control
UOB (China) has a well-established internal control system 
that adheres strictly to local regulators’ requirements and 
the Group’s policies and guidelines. This provides a robust 
framework and systems that enables the Bank to set strategic 
and practical objectives to support its business development.The Board assesses the Bank’s internal control framework and 
systems through the review of risk management reports and 
analysis, operational and budget reports, internal audit reports 
tabled at regular meetings, discussions at various internal 
committees and from the exchange of insights with industry peers.The integrity and effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control 
system is a result of the continuous improvement on the 
internal control environment, including, but not limited to, 
strengthening of risk identification/assessment, monitoring 
processes  and  risk  mitigation  techniques;  and  constantly 
reviewing communication/feedback as well as evaluation /
correction mechanisms. The internal control framework and 
systems are able to provide a reasonable level of assurance on 
the implementation of legal statutes and regulations.Audit
Internal  Audit  is  an  independent  function  that  reports 
functionally to the Audit Committee (AC) and Group Audit, 
while administratively reporting to the President and CEO of 
UOB (China).The primary role of Internal Audit is to assist the Board and 
management to discharge their legal and executive obligations 
by providing independent, objective assurance and value-
added services to improve the Bank’s operations. It helps the 
Bank to accomplish its objectives by having a systematic and 
disciplined approach to provide an independent assessment of 
the adequacy and effectiveness of the Bank’s internal financial 
controls, operational and compliance controls, and to improve 
the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance 
processes.It performs its internal audit function according to the Internal 
Audit Guidelines for Financial Institutions as governed by the 
China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) and 
Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set 
by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). Internal Audit adopts 
a risk-based prioritization approach to develop its strategic 
audit plan to determine audit frequency. This approach also 
adopts a comprehensive assessment of inherent risks, controls, 
management concerns and regulatory hotspots. The audit scope 
covers all businesses, operations as well as the infrastructure 
and applications of systems across UOB (China)’s headquarters 
and branches. The strategic plan is reviewed annually.All internal audit reports are provided to the AC. Significant 
issues are highlighted by Internal Audit, who also closely 
monitors/assesses  the  follow-up  actions  taken  by  the 
management team on the issues raised by Internal Audit, 
external audit and regulators.

and its committees. We have put in place a framework of 
policies, methodologies, tools and processes that will help 
us identify, measure, monitor and manage material risks faced 
by the Bank. This allows us to concentrate our efforts on the

P员工、流程、系统People, Processes, Systems56大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告银行的风险治理框架、政策和偏好为银行风险管理活动提供了总体
原则和指引。它们有助于资本管理、战略规划和预算编制以及绩效
管理的关键决策，以确保风险这一维度得到适当和充分考虑。我们
还在制定风险相关的关键绩效指标 (KPI) 时考虑了银行的风险偏好，
以进行绩效衡量。这也用来在全行部门中树立风险管理理念和文化。我行的风险治理框架、政策和偏好通过识别、计量、监控和报告流
程实施。风险报告定期提交给管理层和董事会，以便他们了解银行
的风险状况。风险治理我行的风险管理责任始于董事会对银行治理结构进行的监督，旨在
确保银行的业务活动：
●       以安全有效的方式开展并符合高标准及健全的商业惯例；
●      符合我行整体业务战略和风险偏好；以及
●   受制于充分的风险管理和内部控制。在这方面，执行委员会 (EXCO) 和董事会风险管理委员会 (BRMC) 协
助董事会进行风险监督。董事会也对银行的整体风险偏好和维持的
风险资本水平进行审阅。在充分考虑风险和回报因素的前提下，由行长兼首席执行官 (CEO)
建立的各高级管理委员会负责协助进行业务决策。涉及的主要高级
管理委员会包括管理委员会 (MC)，资产负债委员会 (ALCO)，信贷委
员会 (ICCC)，操作风险管理委员会 (ORMC)，消费者权益保护委员会
(CRPC) 和风险与资本委员会 (RCC)。这些委员会还协助董事会就具体
风险领域的管理。高级管理层和高级管理委员会被授权对业务条线和 / 或宽泛的产品
条线授予风险偏好限额。风险管理也是银行内每个员工的责任。风险意识和职责通过一个既
定的框架嵌入到我们的企业文化中，确保对整个银行和各种类型的
风险得到有效管理。这是通过如下所示的“三道防线”组织控制结
构实现的：The Bank’s risk governance frameworks, policies and appetite 
provide  the  overarching  principles  and  guidance  for  the 
Bank’s risk management activities. They help to shape our 
key decisions for capital management, strategic planning and 
budgeting, and performance management to ensure that the 
risk dimension is appropriately and sufficiently considered. 
We also take into consideration the Bank’s risk appetite in 
the development of risk-related key performance indicators 
(KPIs) for performance measurement. This serves to embed 
a  risk  management  mindset  and  culture  throughout  the 
organisation.Our risk governance frameworks, policies and appetites are 
implemented through identification, assessment, monitoring 
and reporting processes. Risk reports are regularly submitted 
to management and the Board to keep them apprised of the 
Bank’s risk profile.Risk Governance
UOB (China)’s responsibility for risk management starts at the 
top with our Board overseeing a governance structure that is 
designed to ensure that the Bank’s business activities are:
•    conducted in a safe and sound manner and in line withthe highest standards of professionalism;•    consistent with the Bank’s overall business strategy and•        subjected  to  adequate  risk  management  and  internalrisk appetite; andcontrols.In  this  regard,  the  Board  is  assisted  by  the  Executive 
Committee (EXCO) and Board Risk Management Committee 
(BRMC) in the oversight of risks. The Board also reviews the 
overall risk appetite and level of risk capital to maintain for 
the Bank.The CEO has established senior management committees to 
assist in making business decisions with due consideration to 
risks and returns. The main senior management committees 
involved  in  this  are  the  Management  Committee  (MC), 
Asset  and  Liability  Committee  (ALCO),  In-Country  Credit 
Committee (ICCC), Operational Risk Management Committee 
(ORMC), Consumer Rights Protection Committee (CRPC) and 
the Risk and Capital Committee (RCC). These committees 
also assist the Board committees in specific risk areas.Senior management and the senior management committees 
are authorised to delegate risk appetite limits by business 
lines and/or broad product lines.Risk management is also the responsibility of every employee 
within  the  Bank.  Risk  awareness  and  accountability  are 
embedded in our culture through an established framework 
that ensures appropriate oversight and accountability for the 
effective management of risk throughout the Bank and across 
risk types. This is executed through an organisation control 
structure that provides three lines-of-defence as follows:UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 201857风险管理

The business and business support functions have primary 
responsibility  for  implementing  and  executing  effective 
controls  for  the  management  of  risks  arising  from  their 
business  activities.  This  includes  establishing  adequate 
managerial and supervisory controls to ensure compliance 
with approved risk policies, appetite, limits and controls and 
to highlight control breakdowns, inadequacy of processes 
and unexpected risk events.Second line of defence - Risk Oversight: 
The risk and control oversight functions (Risk Management 
and Compliance Function), and the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) 
provide the second line of defence.The risk and control oversight functions support the Bank’s 
strategy of balancing growth with stability by establishing risk 
policies, frameworks, risk appetite and limits within which 
the business functions must operate. The risk and control 
oversight functions are also responsible for the independent 
review and monitoring of the Bank’s risk profile and highlight 
any significant vulnerabilities and risk issues to the respective 
management committees.The independence of risk and control oversight functions 
from business functions ensures the necessary checks and 
balances.Third line of defence - Independent Audit: 
The Bank’s internal and external auditors conduct risk-based 
audits covering all aspects of the first and second lines of 
defence to provide independent assurance to the CEO, Audit 
Committee and the Board, on the effectiveness of the risk 
management  and  control  structure,  policies,  frameworks, 
systems and processes.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 201859Risk Appetite
UOB  (China)  has  established  a  risk  appetite  framework 
to  define  the  amount  of  risk  we  are  able  and  willing  to 
take in pursuit of its business objectives. The objective of 
establishing a risk appetite framework is not to limit risk-
taking  but  to  ensure  that  the  Bank’s  risk  profile  remains 
within well-defined and tolerable boundaries. The framework 
was formulated based on the following key criteria:•    Relevance to respective stakeholders, with appropriatelevels of granularity;•    Practical, consistent and easy to understand metrics forcommunication and implementation;•     Alignment to key elements of the Bank’s business strategy;
•     Analytically substantiated and measureable metrics.The risk appetite defines suitable thresholds and limits across 
key areas including but not limited to credit risk, country 
risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and reputation 
risk. Our risk-taking approach is focused on businesses which 
we understand and are well-equipped to manage the risk 
involved. Through this approach, we aim to limit earnings 
volatility and concentration risk and ensure that our high 
credit rating, strong capital and funding base remain intact. 
This  allows  us  to  be  a  stable  partner  of  our  customers 
through changing economic conditions and cycles.UOB  (China)’s  risk  appetite  framework  is  updated  and 
approved annually by the Board. Management monitors and 
reports the risk limits to the Board and BRMC.风险管理

信贷风险信贷风险是由于借款人或交易对手无法履行到期的金融或偿付义务
而引致的损失风险。信贷风险是我行开展银行业务所面临的最大单
一风险，通常源自对于零售、公司或者机构借款人的贷款业务或其
他借贷相关承诺。资金和资本市场操作及投资业务同样也会使银行
面临交易对手和发行人的信用风险。完整的信贷风险管理框架清楚地定义了与信贷风险的衡量和管理相

务环境的连续性和适用性。62大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from any failure by a 
borrower or counterparty to meet its financial obligations 
when  such  obligations  are  due.  Credit  risk  is  the  single 
largest risk that we face in our core business as a commercial 
bank, arising primarily from loans and other lending-related 
commitments to retail, corporate and institutional borrowers. 
Treasury and capital market operations, and investments also 
expose the Bank to counterparty and issuer credit risks.Integral  to the management of credit risk  is  a framework 
that clearly defines policies and processes relating to the 
measurement and management of credit risk.Credit Risk Governance and Organisation
The  RCC  and  ICCC  are  the  key  oversight  committees  for 
credit risk and support the CEO and board level committees 
in  managing  the  Bank’s  overall  credit  risk  exposures.  The 
committees serve as executive forum for discussions on all 
credit-related issues including the credit risk management 
framework, policies, processes, infrastructure, methodologies 
and systems. Particularly, ICCC holds the responsibility of 
approving credit facilities and exposures to borrowers and/or 
counterparties of the Bank within the Risk Appetite Limit set 
by the Board and the discretionary limits delegated by the 
EXCO. RCC discusses and proposes credit risk management 
framework for Board's approval, and reviews and assesses the 
Bank’s credit portfolios and credit risk profiles.The Credit Risk Management Division is responsible for the 
reporting, analysis and management of all elements of credit 
risk.  By  adopting  parent  practice  while  catering  for  local 
regulatory and business need, it develops bank-wide credit 
policies and guidelines, and focuses on facilitating business 
development  within  a  prudent,  consistent  and  efficient 
credit risk management framework.Credit Risk Policies and Processes
We have established credit policies and processes to manage 
credit risk in the following key areas:Credit Approval Process
To maintain the independence and integrity of the credit 
approval  process,  our  credit  origination  and  approval 
functions are clearly segregated. Credit approval authority 
is delegated to officers based on their experience, seniority 
and  track  record,  and  credit  approval  is  based  on  a  risk-
adjusted scale according to a borrower’s credit rating. All 
credit approval officers are guided by credit policies and 
credit acceptance guidelines that are periodically reviewed 
to ensure their continued relevance to the Bank’s business 
strategy and the business environment.内部评级系统
我行采用内部评级模型来支持信贷风险评估并按照评级或资产类别
对信贷敞口进行分类。内部评级的使用被贯穿于信贷审批、信贷审
阅和监测、信贷压力测试、限额设定、定价和催收等领域。相关模
型在运用前须通过独立的验证，以确保它们符合需要。为了持续监
测评级模型的可靠性，所有模型须由其拥有部门进行年度审阅，以
确保所选取的风险因素和假设继续与相应的信贷组合保持适用性。交易对手信用风险
我行的交易对手信用风险的计量是将当前盯市价值加上反映潜在风
险暴露 (PFE) 的附加因子 (add-on)。潜在风险暴露因子为既定置信水
平下交易存续期内所有时点正风险暴露的上限，被用来为外汇交易 /
衍生品交易设立限额及内部风险管理。外汇、衍生品和证券融资交易的风险敞口通过签订国际掉期及衍生
工具协会 (ISDA) 主协议或中国银行间市场金融衍生产品交易主协议
(NAFMII) 得到缓释。此类安排允许我行在发生违约时以净额结算方
式平盘未了结的交易，从而将风险敞口降到最低。信贷集中度风险
信贷集中度风险可能源于单笔的大额信贷敞口或互相关联的多笔敞
口。 该类风险通过设定不同种类的限额进行管理， 包括集团、借款
人、行业和国别等，通常限定为银行资本额的一定百分比。定期评
估出现的风险并展望行业和国家前景也被用来提供前瞻性观点，以
衡量对我行业务敞口组合可能的影响。信贷压力测试
信贷压力测试是信贷资产组合管理的一个重要组成部分。它包括确
定可能对我行信贷风险产生不利影响的事件或未来经济状况变化，
以及评估我行在压力情景中管理财务资源的能力。同样的，我行亦
会根据银保监会要求的压力情景和实验参数，对指定的贷款组合实
施相应的信贷压力测试及敏感性分析，以评估受压情况下的贷款质
量和资本状况。Internal Rating System
The  Bank  employs  internal  rating  models  to  support  the 
assessment of credit risk and the assignment of exposures to 
rating grades or pools. Internal ratings are used pervasively 
by the Bank in the areas of credit approval, credit review and 
monitoring, credit stress testing, limits setting, pricing and 
collections. The models are independently validated before 
they are implemented to ensure they are fit for purpose. 
The robustness of these rating models is monitored on an 
ongoing basis, and all models are subject to annual reviews 
conducted by model owners to ascertain that the chosen risk 
factors and assumptions continue to remain relevant for the 
respective portfolios.Counterparty Credit Risk
Counterparty credit risk is measured as the sum of current 
mark-to-market value plus an appropriate add-on factor for 
potential future exposure (PFE). The PFE factor is an estimate 
of the maximum credit exposure over the remaining life of 
the foreign exchange (FX) / derivative transaction and is used 
for limit setting and internal risk management.Exposures arising from FX, derivatives and securities financing 
transactions are typically mitigated through agreements such 
as the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) 
Master Agreements, and the National Association of Financial 
Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII) Agreement.  Such 
agreements help to minimise credit exposure by allowing us 
to offset what we owe to counterparty against what is due 
from that counterparty in the event of a default.Credit Concentration Risk
Credit  concentration  risk  may  arise  from  a  single  large 
exposure  or  from  multiple  exposures  that  are  closely 
correlated.  This  is  managed  by  setting  exposure  limits 
on  obligor  groups,  portfolios,  borrowers,  industries  and 
countries, generally expressed as a percentage of the Bank’s 
eligible  capital  base.  Regular  assessments  of  emerging 
risks  and  reviews  of  industry  and  country  outlooks  are 
also  performed  to  provide  a  forward-looking  view  on 
developments that could impact the Bank’s portfolio.Credit Stress Test
Credit stress-testing is an integral part of the Bank’s credit 
portfolio  management  process.  It  involves  identifying 
possible events or future changes in economic conditions 
that  may  have  unfavorable  effects  on  the  Bank’s  credit 
exposures,  and  assessing  the  Bank’s  ability  to  manage  its 
financial resources through adverse circumstances. Likewise, 
business  credit  stress  test  or  sensitivity  analysis  are  also 
conducted to assess designated loan portfolio’s quality and 
capital impact under the stress scenario and test parameters 
prescribed by CBIRC.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 201863风险管理
Risk Management信贷风险缓释
我行的潜在信贷损失可以通过一系列的增信手段如抵押品、衍生产
品、担保和净额结算安排等起到风险缓释目的。作为一项基本信贷
原则，我行不允许仅凭收到抵押品即给予客户授信，所有授信必须
基于对借款人信用水平、还款来源和偿付能力的综合考量。尽可能地获取抵押品是作为风险缓释的一种手段，抵押品的价值会
被定期监控。价值评估频度则取决于抵押品的种类、可变现性和价
值波动程度。我行接受抵押品的主要种类包括现金、房地产和银行
担保。适当的扣减抵押品的市场价值，反映抵押品的质量、波动性
和可变现性的基本性质。当向中小型企业提供信贷支持时，通常要求客户的主要股东或董事
提供个人担保以显示并确保其对借款人在道义上的承诺和支持。信贷监控和应对管理
银行定期监测和分析信贷敞口、信贷组合表现和可能影响整体信用
水平的新显现的风险。董事会和高级管理层通过各类内部风险报告
获得信贷风险趋势的更新情况。我行还建立了信贷早期预警机制，
由业务部门向高级管理层上报发生信贷质量下降客户的情况，以便
商讨制定账户策略并采取应对行动。逾期账户管理
我行密切监控逾期账户，并以此作为信贷质量的一个重要指示标志。
当客户未能按时还本和 / 或付息时，相应账户即构成逾期。所有逾
期账户包括循环授信（如透支业务）的信用额度超限都将由业务部
门和风险管理部门按规定程序进行监控和管理。Credit Risk Mitigation
Our potential credit losses are mitigated through a variety 
of instruments such as collateral, derivatives, guarantees and 
netting  arrangements.  As  a  fundamental  credit  principle, 
the Bank generally does not grant credit facilities solely on 
the basis of the collateral provided. All credit facilities are 
granted based on the credit standing of the borrower, source 
of repayment and debt servicing ability.Collateral is taken whenever possible to mitigate the credit 
risk assumed and the value of the collateral is monitored 
periodically.  The  frequency  of  valuation  depends  on  the 
type, liquidity and volatility of the collateral. The main types 
of collateral taken by the Bank include cash, real estate and 
bank  guarantees.  Appropriate  haircuts  are  applied  to  the 
market value of collateral, reflecting the underlying nature of 
the collateral, quality, volatility and liquidity.In  extending  credit  facilities  to  small-  and  medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs), we also often take personal guarantees as 
a form of moral support to ensure moral commitment from 
the principal shareholders and directors.Credit Monitoring and Remedial Management
The  Bank  regularly  monitors  credit  exposures,  portfolio 
performance and emerging risks that may impact our credit 
risk profile. The Board and senior management are updated 
on credit trends through internal risk reports. An early alert 
process  has  also  been  put  in  place  whereby  vulnerable 
accounts  are  escalated  by  the  business  units  to  senior 
management for discussion on account strategy and remedial 
actions.Delinquency Monitoring
We monitor closely the delinquency of borrowing accounts 
as  it  is  a  key  indicator  of  credit  quality.  An  account  is 
considered as delinquent when payment is not received on 
the due date. Any delinquent account, including a revolving 
credit  facility  (such  as  an  overdraft)  with  limit  excesses, 
is  closely  monitored  and  managed  through  a  disciplined 
process by officers from business units and risk management 
function.64 大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告贷款分类、损失准备和不良贷款核销
我行依据借款人以正常经营收入归还信贷的能力对信贷资产组合进
行分类。任何逾期或额度超限（如循环授信项下的透支业务）达到
90 天以上的账户将被自动划归为“不良”类。所有客户贷款和垫付款项按照银保监会的指引要求被分为“正常”、
“关注”和“不良”贷款，其中不良贷款被进一步分为“次级”、“可
疑”或“损失”类。我行制订了独立的信贷复审流程来确保贷款五
级分类的合理性。提高不良类账户的分类至“正常”或“关注”时，需以借款人的还
款能力、现金流和财务状况的全面评估作为支持依据。银行应确信
一旦被解除不良分类后，该账户将不会在短期内再次被降级。重组贷款须被划归为“不良”类，并根据银行基于重组条款对借款
人的财务状况和还款能力的评估结果给予适当的信贷分类评级。贷款损失准备的计提严格按照有关指引并谨慎考量包括不良账户项
下抵押品变现收入在内的不良信贷未来清收处置价值。仅当恢复的
前景被认为较差或是其它可能的还款来源均被追索受偿后，该账户
才被准予核销。特殊资产管理和零售信贷管理
特殊资产管理部门 (SAM) 和零售信贷管理部门分别对银行的企业和

目标包括：尽量将这些账户恢复正常并转回相应的业务部门；或退
出该业务关系，最大限度地争取不良贷款回收。Loan Classification, Provisioning and Write-Off
We classify our credit portfolios according to the borrower’s 
ability to repay the credit facility from their normal source 
of income. Any account which is delinquent (or in excess for 
a revolving credit facility such as an overdraft) for more than 
90 days will be categorised automatically as ‘Non-Performing’.All borrowing accounts are categorised into ‘Pass’, ‘Special 
Mention’ or ‘Non-Performing’ categories. Non-Performing 
accounts are further categorised as ‘Substandard’, ‘Doubtful’ 
or ‘Loss’ in accordance with the guidelines of CBIRC. The 
Bank has an independent credit review process to ensure the 
appropriateness of loan grading and classification.Upgrading and declassification of a Non-Performing account 
to ‘Pass’ or ‘Special Mention’ status must be supported by 
a credit assessment of the repayment capability, cash flows 
and  financial  position  of  the  borrower.  It  must  also  be 
satisfied that once the account is declassified, the account is 
unlikely to be classified again in the near future.A restructured account is categorised as ‘Non-Performing’ 
and placed on the appropriate classified grade based on our 
assessment of the financial condition of the borrower and 
the ability of the borrower to repay under the restructured 
terms.Loan loss provision is made in line with CBIRC guidelines 
after  careful  consideration  of  the  future  recovery  value 
including  liquidation of  collateral of the Non-Performing 
account.  A  classified  account  is  written  off  when  the 
prospect  of  a  recovery  is  considered  poor  or  when  all 
feasible avenues of recovery have been exhausted.Special Asset Management and Retail Credit Management
Special Asset Management and Retail Credit Management 
manage  the  Bank’s  corporate  and  housing  loan  non-
performing portfolios respectively. Non-performing accounts 
are proactively managed with the intention of nursing such 
accounts  back  to  financial  health  whenever  possible  for 
transfer back to business unit or maximise recovery of such 
accounts that the Bank intends to exit.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 201865风险管理

independent assessment of the market risk profile of the

policies, practices, and the control structure with appropriate 
delegation of authority and market risk limits. We employ 
valuation methodologies that are in line with sound market 
practices, and we independently validate valuation and risk 
models. In addition, a Product/Service Programme process 
ensures  that  market  risk  issues  identified  are  adequately 
addressed  prior  to  the  launch  of  products  and  services. 
We  continually  review  and  enhance  our  management  of 
derivatives  risks  to  ensure  that  the  complexities  of  the 
business are appropriately controlled.Our  overall  market  risk  appetite  is  balanced  at  the  Bank 
and  business  unit  levels  with  targeted  revenue  and  takes 
into account the capital position of the Bank. This ensures 
that the Bank remains well-capitalised, even under  stress 
conditions. The risk appetite  is translated  into risk limits 
that are delegated to business units. These risk limits have 
proportional returns that are commensurate with the risks 
taken.Market  risk  appetite  is  provided  for  all  trading  exposure 
within  the  Bank  as  well  as  the  Bank’s  non-trading  FX 
exposures. The Bank is mainly exposed to market risk in its 
trading portfolios that arises from changes in interest rates, 
FX rates and commodity prices from the Bank’s client-driven 
market making and product structuring activities as well as 
trading activities.The Bank currently adopts the Standardised Approach for the 
calculation of regulatory market risk capital but uses Internal 
Models Approach to measure and control trading market 
risks.The Bank estimates a daily Value-at-Risk (VaR) within a 99 
per cent confidence interval, using the historical simulation 
method, as a control for market risk. The method assumes 
that possible future changes in market rates may be implied 
by observed historical market movements.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 201867风险管理

The ALCO maintains oversight of the effectiveness of the 
interest rate risk management structure. The BSRM supports 
the ALCO in monitoring the interest rate risk profile of the

is  to  protect  and  to  enhance  capital  or  economic  net 
worth through adequate, stable and reliable growth in net 
interest earnings under a broad range of possible economic 
conditions.Banking book interest rate risk exposure is quantified using 
analysis tools including repricing schedules and sensitivity 
analysis. They provide indications of the potential impact 
of interest rate changes on interest income and price value 
through the analysis of the sensitivity of assets and liabilities 
to changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity varies 
with different repricing periods, currencies and embedded 
options.  Mismatches  in  the  longer  tenor  will  experience 
greater change in the price-value of interest rate positions 
than similar positions in the shorter tenor.We  also  perform  stress  tests  regularly  to  determine  the 
adequacy  of  capital  in  meeting  the  impact  of  extreme 
interest rate movements on the balance sheet. Such tests 
are also performed to provide early warnings of potential 
extreme losses, facilitating the proactive management of 
interest rate risks in an environment of rapid financial market

Risk Management
流动性风险我行保持充足的流动性以保障银行日常运营的开展，满足存款的提
款和贷款的发放，投资新项目以及支付到期的借款。因此，流动性
管理的主旨在于应付银行确定的及不可确定的资金需求。我行流动性风险管理是在完整的风险管理框架下进行的，包含经由
资产负债委员会批准的各项政策、控制流程、风险限额。这些政策、
控制流程及风险限额确保我行在不同的市场环境下有充足的资金以
应对流动性需求。这些措施包括通过多样化资金的来源及其期限将
资金集中度降至最小，以及持有高流动性债券。我行在流动性风险管理方面采取保守立场，持续的吸收核心存款，
严格遵守流动性风险额度，保留充足的流动资产等措施来防范可能
出现的资金短缺。我行通过主动分散存款的来源，以确保成本效率的均衡，资金的持续
可获得以及资金来源的多样化。确保流动性重要的因素还包括通过竞
争性定价，积极主动地管理银行的核心存款以及维护客户的信心。和监管当局的流动性风险管理框架一致，我行通过预测银行现金流
来度量和管理流动性风险，现金流的预测是基于“正常业务情景”
和“压力情景”来进行。我行设置现金流错配限额来控制银行流动
性风险敞口的同时，还采用流动性早期预警指标和警戒线以揭示可
能出现的危机状况。针对于 2018 年 12 月 31 日起生效的优质流动性
资产充足率监管要求，截止 2018 年 12 月 31 日，我行优质流动性资
产充足率为 129.4%，其中合格优质流动性资产约为人民币 83.2 亿元，
未来 30 天现金净流出量约为人民币 64.3 亿元。我行在建立的流动性应急计划中运用一系列的预警指标揭示可能发生
的流动性危机。在该应急计划中，我行通过设立危机上报流程及包括
融资、沟通等危机处理策略来减少流动性危机所带来的负面影响。Liquidity Risk
The  bank  maintains  sufficient  liquidity  to  fund  our  day-
to-day operations, to meet deposit withdrawals and loan 
disbursements, to participate in new investments, and to 
repay borrowings. Hence, liquidity is managed in a manner to 
address known as well as unanticipated cash funding needs.Liquidity risk is managed in accordance with a framework of 
policies, controls and limits approved by the ALCO. These 
policies, controls and limits enable the bank to monitor and 
to manage  liquidity risk to ensure that sufficient sources 
of funds  are available over a range of market conditions. 
These include minimising excessive funding concentrations 
by diversifying the sources and terms of funding as well as 
maintaining a portfolio of high quality and marketable debt 
securities.We  take  a  conservative  stance  in  the  Bank’s  liquidity 
management by continuing to gather core deposits, ensuring 
that liquidity limits are strictly adhered to and that there are 
adequate liquid assets to meet cash shortfall.The distribution of deposits is managed actively to ensure a 
balance between cost effectiveness, continued accessibility 
to funds and diversification of funding sources. Important 
factors  in  ensuring  liquidity  are  competitive  pricing, 
proactive management of the bank’s core deposits and the 
maintenance of customer confidence.Our liquidity risk is aligned with the regulatory liquidity risk 
management framework and is measured and managed on 
a projected cash flow basis. The bank is monitored under 
business-as-usual and stress scenarios. Cash flow mismatch 
limits are established to limit the bank’s liquidity exposure. 
We also employ liquidity early warning indicators and trigger 
points to signal possible contingency situations. With regard 
to  the  regulatory  requirements  on  High  Quality  Liquid 
Asset Adequacy Ratio (HQLAAR) which are effective from 
31 December 2018, the bank’s ratio was about 129.4 per cent 
as at 31 December 2018 with High Quality Liquidity Assets 
(HQLA) of RMB8.32 billion and Net Cash Outflow (NCO) of 
RMB6.43 billion.We  have  contingency  funding  plans  in  place  to  identify 
potential liquidity crises using a series of warning indicators. 
Crisis management processes and various strategies including 
funding  and  communication  have  been  developed  to 
minimise the impact of any liquidity crunch.70 大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告操作风险操作风险是由于不健全的或失效的内部流程、人员或系统及外部事

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate 
or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from 
external events. Operational risk includes banking operations 
risk,  fraud  risk,  legal  risk,  regulatory  compliance  risks, 
reputational risk, outsourcing risk and technology risk.Our primary objective is to maintain sound operations and 
to protect the Bank’s reputation.Operational Risk Governance, Framework and Tools
Operational risk is managed through a framework of policies 
and procedures by which business and support units properly 
identify, assess, monitor, mitigate and report their risks. The 
ORMC meets monthly to provide oversight of operational 
risk matters in the bank.The Operational Risk Governance structure adopts the three 
lines-of-defence model. The business and support functions, 
as the first line of defence, are responsible for establishing 
a robust control environment as part of their day-to-day 
operations. Each business and support unit is responsible for 
implementing the operational risk framework and policies, 
embedding appropriate internal controls into processes and 
maintaining business resilience for key activities.The Operational Risk Management Division, as the second 
line  of  defence,  provides  overarching  governance  of 
operational  risk  through  relevant  frameworks,  policies, 
programmes  and  systems.  It  also  monitors  key  risk  self-
assessment  results,  outsourcing  matters,  operational  risk 
indicator  breaches,  self-identified  operational  risks  and 
incidents and reports these to Management, the relevant 
senior management committees and the Board.Internal Audit acts as the third line of defence by providing 
an  independent  and  objective  assessment  on  the  overall 
effectiveness of the risk governance framework and internal 
control through periodic audit reviews.A  key  component  of  the  operational  risk  management 
framework is risk identification and control self-assessments. 
This is achieved through the Bank-wide implementation of 
a set of operational risk programmes. Several risk mitigation 
policies and programmes are in place to maintain a sound 
operating environment.We  have  business  continuity  and  crisis  management 
programmes in place to ensure prompt recovery of critical 
business  and  support  units  should  there  be  unforeseen 
events. The Management provides an annual attestation to 
the Board on the state of business continuity readiness of 
the Bank.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 201871风险管理

liability, cyber security, property damage, terrorism, public 
liability,  as  well  as  directors’  and  officers’  liability.  The 
programme  reduces  operational  losses  through  adequate 
insurance coverage.We  have  also  adopted  a  technology  risk  management 
framework to enable the Bank to manage technology risks in 
a systematic and consistent manner.Regulatory risk refers to the risk of non-compliance with 
laws, regulations, rules, standards and codes of conduct. We 
identify, monitor and manage this risk through a structured 
governance framework of Compliance policies, procedures 
and  guidelines  maintained  by  the  Bank.  The  framework 
also manages the risk of regulatory breaches and sanctions 
relating  to  anti-money  laundering  and  countering  the 
financing of terrorism.Legal risk arises from unenforceable, unfavourable, defective 
or unintended contracts, lawsuits or claims, developments 
in laws and regulations, or non-compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations. Business and support units work with 
the Bank’s internal and external legal counsels to ensure that 
legal risks are managed.Reputational risk is the risk of adverse impact on earnings, 
liquidity  or  capital  arising  from  negative  stakeholder 
perception  or  opinion  of  the  Bank’s  business  practices, 
activities and financial condition. The Bank recognises the 
impact of reputational risk and has developed respective 
framework and policy to identify and to manage the risk in 
the Bank.Outsourcing risk is the risk of adverse financial, operational, 
and reputational, legal and compliance impact arising from 
the failure of a service provider to provide the outsourced 
service or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, 
or a service provider’s breaches of security. The Bank has in 
place the Outsourcing Risk Management framework, policy, 
procedures and guidelines to manage outsourcing risks.72大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告欺诈风险欺诈是指具有欺骗或掩盖事实等特征的行为，不仅限与获取金钱或

Ernst & Young Hua Ming (2019) Shen Zi No 60658622_B01
United Overseas Bank (China) LimitedTo the Board of Directors of United Overseas Bank (China) 
Limited:(I) Opinion
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of 
United Overseas Bank (China) Limited(hereinafter referred 
to as “the Bank”), which comprise the balance sheet as at 
31 December 2018, the income statement, the statement of 
changes in equity and the statement of cash flows for the 
year then ended, and notes to the financial statements.In  our  opinion,  the  accompanying  financial  statements 
present fairly, in all material respects, United Overseas Bank 
(China) Limited’s financial position as at 31 December 2018 and 
United Overseas Bank (China) Limited’s financial performance 
and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with 
Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises (“ASBEs”).(II) Basis for Opinion
We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  China 
Standards on Auditing (“CSAs”). Our responsibilities under 
those  standards  are  further  described  in  the  Auditor’s 
responsibilities  for  the  audit  of  the  financial  statements 
section  of  our  report.  We  are  independent  of  United 
Overseas  Bank  (China)  Limited  in  accordance  with  China 
Code of Ethics for Certified Public Accountants (the “Code”), 
and  we  have  fulfilled  our  other  ethical  responsibilities 
in accordance  with  the  Code.   We  believe that  the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.(III)  Responsibilities  of  the  management  and 
those charged with governance for the financial 
statements
The management of United Overseas Bank (China) Limited 
is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of 
the  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  ASBEs,  and 
for designing, implementing and maintaining such internal 
control  as  the  management  determines  is  necessary  to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.In  preparing  the  financial  statements,  the  management 
is responsible for assessing United Overseas Bank (China) 
Limited’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting, unless the management 
either  intends  to  liquidate  United  Overseas  Bank  (China) 
Limited or to cease operations or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so.Those  charged  with  governance  are  responsible  for 
overseeing United Overseas Bank (China) Limited’s financial 
reporting process.(IV) Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements 
Our  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with CSAs 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are generally 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions  of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of  these  financial 
statements.As part of an audit in accordance with CSAs, we exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:(1)  Identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement 
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient  and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.(2)  Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal 
control.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 201881(3) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the management.(4) Conclude on the appropriateness of the management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast 
significant doubt on United Overseas Bank (China) Limited’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention 
in  our  auditor’s  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. 
However,  future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  United 
Overseas  Bank  (China)  Limited  to  cease  to  continue  as  a 
going concern.(5) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that  achieves  fair 
presentation.We  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance 
regarding,  among  other  matters,  the  planned  scope  and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any  significant  deficiencies  in  internal  control  that  we 
identify during our audit.Ernst & Young Hua Ming LLP, Shanghai BranchChinese Certified Public Accountant: Yan, ShengweiShanghai   ChinaChinese Certified Public Accountant: Wang, Wenyan29 March 201982 大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告资产负债表

算为记账本位币金额。于资产负债表日，对于外币货币性项目采用
资产负债表日即期汇率折算，由此产生的结算和货币性项目折算差

计量的外币非货币性项目，采用公允价值确定日的即期汇率折算，
由此产生的差额根据非货币性项目的性质计入当期损益或其他综合
收益。5. 固定资产
固定资产仅在与其有关的经济利益很可能流入本公司，且其成本能
够可靠地计量时才予以确认。与固定资产有关的后续支出，符合该
确认条件的，计入固定资产成本，并终止确认被替换部分的账面价值；
否则，在发生时计入当期损益。固定资产按照成本进行初始计量。购置固定资产的成本包括购买价

Transactions  in  foreign  currencies  are  translated  into  the 
reporting currency accordingly.Foreign  currency  transactions  are  translated  using  the 
exchange rates ruling at the transaction date. Subsequent 
to  initial  recognition,  monetary  assets  and  liabilities 
denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are  translated  at  the 
applicable  exchange  rates  ruling  at  the  balance  sheet 
date. Exchange differences arising from the settlement of 
monetary items or from translation of monetary items at 
balance sheet date are recognised in the income statement. 
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates ruling at 
the dates of the initial transactions; Non-monetary items 
measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rates when the fair value is determined, 
the exchange difference thus resulted is recognised in the 
income statement or other comprehensive income of the 
current period.(5) Fixed assets
The fixed assets can be recognised only when the economic 
benefits related to fixed assets are likely to flow into the 
Bank, and the cost of fixed assets can be measured reliably. 
Subsequent expenditure can be recognised as the cost of 
fixed assets when the recognition criteria set above is met, 
and  the  replaced  carrying  amount  shall  be  derecognised. 
Otherwise, such expenditure is to be charged to the income 
statement in the period when it is incurred.Fixed  assets  are  initially  measured  at  cost.  The  cost  of 
a  purchased  fixed  asset  comprises  the  purchase  price, 
relevant taxes and any directly attributable expenditure for 
bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line 
basis. And the respective estimated useful lives, estimated 
residual values and annual depreciation rates of fixed assets

在建工程成本按实际工程支出确定，包括在建期间发生的各项必要
工程支出以及其他相关费用等。在建工程在达到预定可使用状态时转入固定资产、无形资产或其他
长期资产。7. 无形资产
无形资产仅在与其有关的经济利益很可能流入本公司，且其成本能
够可靠地计量时才予以确认，并以成本进行初始计量。无形资产按照其能为本公司带来经济利益的期限确定使用寿命，无
法预见其为本公司带来经济利益期限的作为使用寿命不确定的无形
资产。本公司的无形资产为软件，其使用年限为 8 年。使用寿命有限的无形资产，在其使用寿命内采用直线法摊销。本公
司在每个资产负债表日均对使用寿命有限的无形资产的使用寿命及
摊销方法进行复核，必要时进行调整。8. 长期待摊费用
长期待摊费用采用直线法摊销。以经营性租赁方式租入固定资产发生的租赁费用，根据合同期限平
均摊销。其他长期待摊费用根据合同或协议与受益期限孰短原则确
定摊销期限，并平均摊销。如果长期摊销的费用项目不能使以后会计期间受益的，将尚未摊销
的项目的摊余价值全部转入当期损益。9. 金融工具（自 2018 年 1 月 1 日起适用）
金融工具，是指形成一个企业的金融资产，并形成其他单位的金融
负债或权益工具的合同。金融工具的确认和终止确认

类似金融资产的一部分 )，即从其账户和资产负债表内予以转销：(6) Construction in progress
The cost of construction in progress is determined according 
to the actual expenditure for the construction, including all 
necessary expenditure and other related expenses incurred 
during the construction period.The costs are transferred to fixed assets, intangible assets 
or other long  term assets when the asset is ready  for its 
intended use.(7) Intangible assets
The  intangible  assets  can  be  recognised  only  when  the 
economic benefits related to intangible assets are likely to 
flow into the Bank, and the cost of intangible assets can be 
measured reliably. While the intangible assets obtained in 
a business combination under common control should be 
measured at fair value if the cost of intangible assets can be 
measured reliably.The useful life of intangible assets is determined according 
to the economic useful lives; those intangible assets with 
unforeseeable economic lives can be classified as intangible 
assets with infinite useful lives.The Bank’s intangible assets comprise  computer software 
with a 8-year useful life.For the intangible assets with finite useful lives, amortisation 
is charged to income statement on a straight line. The useful 
life and amortisation method for intangible assets with finite 
useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date, with 
proper adjustments made by the Bank when necessary.(8) Long-term deferred expenses
Long-term deferred expenses are amortised by the straight 
line method.Rental fee of the operating lease of fixed assets is amortised 
on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease contract. 
Other  long-term  deferred  expenses  are  amortised  on  a 
straight-line basis over the lower period of lease period or 
useful life.The carrying amount that has not been amortised is charged 
to  income  statement  if  the  expenditure  does  not  bring 
benefits to subsequent accounting periods.(9) Financial instruments (applicable since 1 January 2018 )
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity.Recognition and derecognition of financial instrument
A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised when the 
Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
financial instrument.A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial 
asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily 
derecognised (i.e., removed from the Bank’s balance sheet) when:UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 201891(i)  收取金融资产现金流量的权利届满；(ii)  转移了收取金融资产现金流量的权利，或在“过手协议”下承担
了及时将收取的现金流量全额支付给第三方的义务；并且 (a) 实质上
转让了金融资产所有权上几乎所有的风险和报酬，或 (b) 虽然实质上
既没有转移也没有保留金融资产所有权上几乎所有的风险和报酬，
但放弃了对该金融资产的控制。如果金融负债的责任已履行、撤销或届满，则对金融负债进行终止
确认。如果现有金融负债被同一债权人以实质上几乎完全不同条款
的另一金融负债所取代，或现有负债的条款几乎全部被实质性修改，
则此类替换或修改作为终止确认原负债和确认新负债处理，差额计
入当期损益。以常规方式买卖金融资产，按交易日会计进行确认和终止确认。常
规方式买卖金融资产，是指按照合同条款的约定，在法规或通行惯
例规定的期限内收取或交付金融资产。交易日，是指本公司承诺买
入或卖出金融资产的日期。金融资产分类和计量
本公司的金融资产于初始确认时根据本公司企业管理金融资产的业
务模式和金融资产的合同现金流量特征分类为：以公允价值计量且
其变动计入当期损益的金融资产、以摊余成本计量的金融资产、以
公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的金融资产。对于以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产，相关交易
费用直接计入当期损益，其他类别的金融资产相关交易费用计入其
初始确认金额。金融资产的后续计量取决于其分类：以摊余成本计量的债务工具投资
金融资产同时符合下列条件的，分类为以摊余成本计量的金融资产：
管理该金融资产的业务模式是以收取合同现金流量为目标；该金融
资产的合同条款规定，在特定日期产生的现金流量仅为对本金和以
未偿付本金金额为基础的利息的支付。此类金融资产采用实际利率
法确认利息收入，其终止确认、修改或减值产生的利得或损失，均
计入当期损益。此类金融资产主要包含存放中央银行款项、存放同
业款项、拆出资金、发放贷款和垫款、其他应收款等。92 大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告(i) the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset 
have expired; or(ii) The Bank has transferred its rights to receive cash flows 
from the financial asset, or has assumed an obligation to pay 
the received cash flows in full without material delay to a 
third party under a “pass-through” arrangement; and either 
(a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the financial asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the financial asset.A  financial  liability  is  derecognised  when  the  obligation 
under the liability is discharged, cancelled, or expires.  When 
an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the 
same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an 
exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of 
the original liability and a recognition of a new liability, and 
the difference between the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in profit or loss.A  regular  way  purchases  or  sales  of  financial  assets  are 
recognised and derecognised, as applicable, using trade date 
accounting. A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets 
represents a purchase or sale of a financial asset under a 
contract whose terms require delivery of the asset within the 
time frame established generally by regulation or convention 
in the marketplace concerned. The trade date is the date that 
the Bank committed to purchase or sell a financial asset.Classification and measurement of financial assets
Financial assets of the Bank are initially classified into three 
categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, 
financial assets at amortised cost, and financial assets at fair 
value through other comprehensive income based on the 
Bank’s business model for managing the financial assets and 
their contractual cash flow characteristics.Underlying fee of financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss are directly recognised in profit or loss, while those 
of other classifications are attributed to the acquisition of 
financial assets.Subsequent measurement of financial assets are based on 
their classification:Debt instrument investment at amortised cost
Financial  assets  are  classified  into  financial  assets  at 
amortised cost when both of the following conditions are 
satisfied: The business model is to collect contractual cash 
flows; the cash flows on specific date are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principle amount outstanding 
according to the agreement of  the financial  assets. Their 
interest income is recognised using the effective interest 
rate  method.  Gains  or  losses  arising  from  derecognition, 
modification  or  impairment  are  recognised  in  profit  or 
loss. Such financial assets mainly include deposit with the 
Central Bank, due from banks and other financial institutions, 
placements with banks and other financial institutions, loans 
and advances to customers, other receivable etc.以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的债务工具投资

外，其余公允价值变动计入其他综合收益。当金融资产终止确认时，
之前计入其他综合收益的累计利得或损失从其他综合收益转出，计
入当期损益。此类金融资产列报为其他债权投资。以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产

其变动计入当期损益的金融资产。对于此类金融资产，采用公允价
值进行后续计量，所有公允价值变动计入当期损益。金融负债分类和计量
本公司的金融负债于初始确认时分类为：以公允价值计量且其变动
计入当期损益的金融负债、其他金融负债。对于以公允价值计量且
其变动计入当期损益的金融负债，相关交易费用直接计入当期损益，

值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融负债。Debt instrument at fair value through other comprehensive 
income
Financial  assets  are  classified  into  Financial  assets  at  fair 
value through other comprehensive income when both of 
the following conditions are satisfied: The business model 
is to collect both the contractual cash flows and cash flows 
arising from the sale of assets; the cash flows on specific 
date are solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding according to the agreement 
of the financial assets. Their interest income is recognised 
using  the  effective  interest  rate  method.  A  gain  or  loss 
arising from a change in the fair value is recognised as other 
comprehensive  income,  except  for  interest  come,  credit 
impairment  losses  and  foreign  exchange  gains  or  losses, 
which  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss.  The  gain  or  loss 
recognised in other comprehensive income will be reversed 
and recognised in profit or loss when the financial assets are 
derecognised.  Such financial assets are presented as other 
debt instrument at fair value through other comprehensive 
income.Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Other than the financial assets at amortised cost and the 
financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income mentioned above, financial assets are classified into 
financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.  Such 
financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value and 
the gain or loss arising from a change in the fair value will be 
recognised in profit or loss.Classification and measurement of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities 
at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  or  other  financial 
liabilities. Underlying fee of financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss are directly recognised in profit or loss, 
while those of other financial liabilities are attributed to the 
acquisition of financial liabilities.Subsequent measurement of financial liabilities is based on 
their classification:Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include 
financial liabilities held for trading (including derivatives that 
are liabilities ) and financial liabilities designated upon initial 
recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 201893满足下列条件之一的，属于交易性金融负债：承担相关金融负债的

held for trading when one of the following conditions is 
satisfied: Undertaking the financial liabilities is for selling 
or repurchase of them in the near future; Forming a  part 
of  the  identifiable  combination  of  financial  instruments 
which are managed in a centralised way and for which there 
are objective evidences proving that the Bank may manage 
the combination by a way of short-term profit making in 
the  near  future;  Being  a  derivative  instrument,  excluding 
the designated derivative instruments which are effective 
hedging instruments, or derivative instruments to financial 
guarantee  contracts.  Financial  liabilities  held  for  trading 
(including derivatives liabilities ) are subsequently measured 
at fair value and the gain or loss arising from a change in the 
fair value will be recognised in profit or loss.Other financial liabilities
Such  financial  liabilities  are  subsequently  measured  at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.Impairment of financial instruments
The Bank recognises a loss for impairment of financial assets 
at amortised cost, debt instrument measured at fair through 
other  comprehensive  income,  loan  commitments  and 
financial guarantee contracts based on their expected credit 
loss.Expected credit loss is the difference between all contractual 
cash flows that are due to the Bank in accordance with the 
contract and all cash flows expected to be received by the 
Bank discounted at the original effective interest rate, i.e. the 
present value of all cash shortfalls. For the financial assets 
with the credit impairment loss which is original or incurred 
when purchasing, the cash flow should be discounted by the 
credit-adjusted effective interest rate.For  receivable  and  contract  assets  without  significant 
financing components, the Bank uses the simplified approach 
to calculate the credit impairment loss, based on lifetime 
expected credit loss.94 大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告除上述采用简化计量方法以外的金融资产、贷款承诺及财务担保合

financial  guarantee  contracts  using  simplified  approach, 
the Bank evaluates whether the credit risk has significantly 
increases  since  the  initial  recognition  at  each  financial 
reporting date. When credit risk hasn’t increased significantly 
since the initial recognition, the financial instruments are 
included in Stage I. the Bank calculate impairment allowance 
at  an  amount  equivalent  to  the  ECL  of  the  financial 
instruments for the next 12 months, recognise the interest 
income by using the carrying amount and effective interest 
rate.  When  credit  risk  has  increased  significantly  since 
the initial recognition, but have no objective evidence of 
impairment, the financial intruments are included in Stage II, 
the Bank calculate the impairment allowance at an amount 
equivalent  to  the  ECL  over  the  lifetime  of  the  financial 
instruments,  and  recognise  the  interest  income  by  using 
carrying amount and effective interest rate. If the financial 
assets have objective evidence of impairment, the financial 
instruments are included in Stage III, the Bank calculate the 
impairment allowance at an amount equivalent to the ECL 
over the lifetime of the financial instruments, and recognise 
the interest income by using amortised cost and effective 
interest rate. For financial instruments without any significant 
credit risk on financial reporting date, the Bank assume there 
isn’t any significant increases in credit risk since the initial 
recognition.The Bank estimates the expected credit loss with consideration 
of the past events, the present condition and forecasts of 
future economic conditions.The disclosure related to the criterion for whether the credit 
risk has  increased significantly, the definition of the impaired 
financial assets and the hypothesis of the measurement of 
expected credit loss refers to Note 10.1.When the Bank no longer reasonably expects to collect part 
or all of the contractual cash flows, the Bank writes down 
the carrying amount of the financial assets.Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the 
net amount presented in the balance sheet when and only 
when the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to 
set off the recognised amounts and intends either to settle 
on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.Financial guarantee contract
Financial  guarantee  contracts  are  those  contracts  that 
require issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the 
holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails 
to make payment when due in accordance with the original 
or modified terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee 
contracts are measured, on initial recognition, at fair value. 
After initial recognition, financial guarantee contracts are 
subsequent measured at the higher of, (i) the expected credit 
impairment loss determined on financial reporting date and 
(ii) the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, 
the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance 
with the revenue principle.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 201895衍生金融工具

The  Bank  uses  derivative  financial  instruments.  Such 
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair 
value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered 
into and are subsequently measured at fair value. Derivatives 
are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as 
liabilities when the fair value is negative.Any  gains  or  losses  arising  from  changes  in  fair  value  of 
derivatives are recognised directly in profit or loss.Modification of financial assets
When  the  contractual  cash  flows  of  a  financial  asset  are 
renegotiated or otherwise modified and the renegotiation 
or  modification  does  not  result  in  the  derecognition  of 
that financial asset, the Bank recalculate the gross carrying 
amount as the present value of the renegotiated or modified 
contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial 
asset's original effective interest rate (or the credit-adjusted 
effective interest  rate). The modification  gain or loss are 
recognised in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred adjust 
the carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are 
amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial 
asset.Transfer of financial assets
A  financial  asset  is  derecognised  when  the  Bank  has 
transferred  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  the 
financial  asset  to  the  transferee.  A  financial  asset  is  not 
derecognised when the Bank retains substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the financial asset.When  the  Bank  has  neither  transferred  nor  retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the financial asset, it 
either (i) derecognises the financial asset and recognises the 
assets and liabilities created in the transfer when it has not 
retained control of the asset; or (ii) continues to recognise 
the financial asset to the extent of the Bank's continuing 
involvement,  in  which  case,  the  Bank  also  recognises  an 
associated liability.Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee 
over  the  transferred  financial  asset  is  measured  at  the 
lower of the carrying amount of the financial asset and the 
guarantee amount. The guarantee amount is the maximum 
amount of consideration that the Bank could be required to 
repay.(10) Financial instruments (applicable in 2017)
Recognition and derecognition of financial instrument
The Bank recognises a financial asset or a financial liability 
when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of a 
financial instrument.A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial 
asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily 
derecognised (i.e., removed from the Bank’s balance sheet) when:(i)    the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assethave expired; or(ii)  转移了收取金融资产现金流量的权利，或在“过手协议”下承担
了及时将收取的现金流量全额支付给第三方的义务；并且 (a) 实
质上转让了金融资产所有权上几乎所有的风险和报酬，或 (b) 虽
然实质上既没有转移也没有保留金融资产所有权上几乎所有的风
险和报酬，但放弃了对该金融资产的控制。如果金融负债的责任已履行、撤销或届满，则对金融负债进行终止确
认。如果现有金融负债被同一债权人以实质上几乎完全不同条款的另
一金融负债所取代，或现有负债的条款几乎全部被实质性修改，则此
类替换或修改作为终止确认原负债和确认新负债处理，差额计入当期
损益。以常规方式买卖金融资产，按交易日会计进行确认和终止确认。交易
日，是指本公司承诺买入或卖出金融资产的日期。金融工具分类和计量

flows  from  the  financial  asset,  or  has  assumed  an 
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without 
material delay to a third party under a “pass-through” 
arrangement; and either (a) has transferred substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the financial asset, or (b) has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of 
the financial asset.A  financial  liability  is  derecognised  when  the  obligation 
under  the  liability  is  discharged  or  cancelled,  or  expires.  
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another 
from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such 
an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of 
the original liability and a recognition of a new liability, and 
the difference between the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in profit or loss.A  regular  way  purchases  or  sales  of  financial  assets  are 
recognised  and  derecognised,  as  applicable,  using  trade 
date accounting.  The trade date is the date that the Bank 
committed to purchase or sell a financial asset.Classification and measurement of financial instruments
Financial assets at fair value through profit or lossFinancial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are 
financial assets which are either classified as held for trading 
or designated by the Bank at fair value through profit or loss 
upon initial recognition. For such financial assets, initially 
recognised at fair value, with underlying fee recognised in 
profit or loss, and are subsequently measured at fair value. 
Both  realised  and  unrealised  gains/losses  are  recognised 
in profit or loss of the current period. The dividends and 
interest income related with financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss of the 
current period.Financial assets on initial recognition classified as financial 
assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  cannot  be 
reclassified into financial assets of other categories; financial 
assets  of  other  categories  cannot  be  reclassified  into 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.Held-to-maturity investments
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial 
assets  with  fixed  or  determinable  payments  and  a  fixed 
maturity date and which the Bank has the positive intention 
and  ability  to  hold  to  maturity.  For  such  financial  assets, 
they are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly 
transaction costs attributable to the acquisition of financial 
assets.  Held-to-maturity  investments  are  subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method. Gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss of 
the current period when they are derecognised, impaired, or 
amortised.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 201897有客观证据表明该金融资产发生减值的，计提减值准备。对单项金额

there is objective evidence of impairment. For a financial 
asset that is not individually significant, the Bank can include 
the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk

融负债。对于此类金融负债，在初始确认时以公允价值计量，相关交
易费用直接计入当期损益，按照公允价值进行后续计量，所有已实现
和未实现的损益均计入当期损益。企业在初始确认时将某金融负债划分为以公允价值计量且其变动计入
当期损益的金融负债后，不能重分类为其他金融负债；其他金融负债
也不能重分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融负债。其他金融负债
对于此类金融负债，在初始确认时以公允价值计量，相关交易费用计
入初始确认金额；采用实际利率法，按照摊余成本进行后续计量。Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial 
assets which are designated as such or are not classified in 
any of the above categories. For such financial assets, they are 
initially measured at fair value plus any directly transaction 
costs attributable to the acquisition of the financial assets. 
Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently measured 
at fair value. Premiums and discounts on available-for-sale 
financial assets are amortised using the effective interest rate 
method and are taken to the profit or loss as interest income 
or expense. Impairment losses and foreign exchange gains 
and losses on available-for-sale financial assets which are 
monetary items are recognised in the profit or loss, besides 
changes in fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are 
recognised in other comprehensive income until the financial 
asset is derecognised at which time the cumulative gains or 
losses previously reported in other comprehensive income 
are  included  in  the  profit  or  loss.  Dividend  and  interest 
income on available-for-sale financial assets are recorded in 
profit or loss of the current period.When there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, 
the  cumulative  loss  from  declines  in  fair  value  that  had 
been recognised directly in other comprehensive income 
are  removed  from  equity  and  recognised  in  the  profit  or 
loss.  The amount of the cumulative loss that is removed 
from other comprehensive income and recognised in profit 
or loss is the net of principal, any principal repayment and 
amortization, less current fair value, and any impairment loss 
on that financial asset previously recognised in the profit or 
loss.If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has 
been  incurred  on  a  financial  asset  measured  at  cost,  the 
amount of the loss is measured as the difference between 
the  asset's  carrying  amount  and  the  present  value  of 
estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market 
rate of return for a similar financial asset, and recognised 
in profit or loss.  Impairment losses on these assets are not 
reversed.Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include 
financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities 
designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through 
profit or loss. They are recognised initially at fair value, with 
transaction costs taken directly charged to profit or loss, and 
are subsequently measured at fair value. All the realised and 
unrealised gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss.Financial liabilities initial recognied as financial liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss cannot be reclassified into 
other  categories;  financial  liabilities  of  other  categories 
cannot be reclassified into financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss as well.Other financial liabilities
Other  financial  liabilities  are  initially  recognised  at  fair 
value  less  any  directly  transaction  costs  attributable  to 
the acquisition of financial liabilities and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 201899金融工具抵销

日的公允价值进行计量，并以其公允价值进行后续计量。公允价值为
正数的衍生金融工具确认为一项资产，公允价值为负数的确认为一项
负债。但对于在活跃市场中没有报价且其公允价值不能可靠计量的权
益工具挂钩并须通过交付该权益工具结算的衍生金融工具，按成本计量。衍生工具公允价值变动而产生的利得或损失，直接计入当期损益。Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the 
net amount presented in the balance sheet when and only 
when the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to 
set off the recognised amounts and intends either to settle 
on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.Transfer of financial assets
A  financial  asset  is  derecognised  when  the  Bank  has 
transferred  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  the 
financial  asset  to  the  transferee.    A  financial  asset  is  not 
derecognised when the Bank retains substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the financial asset.When  the  Bank  has  neither  transferred  nor  retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the financial asset, it 
either (i) derecognises the financial asset and recognises the 
assets and liabilities created in the transfer when it has not 
retained control of the asset; or (ii) continues to recognise 
the financial asset to the extent of the Bank's continuing 
involvement,  in  which  case,  the  Bank  also  recognises  an 
associated liability.Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee 
over  the  transferred  financial  asset  is  measured  at  the 
lower of the carrying amount of the financial asset and the 
guarantee amount. The guarantee amount is the maximum 
amount of consideration that the Bank could be required to 
repay.Financial guarantee contract
Financial  guarantee  contracts  are  those  contracts  that 
require a payment to be made by the issuer to reimburse the 
holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails 
to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms 
of  a  debt  instrument.    Financial  guarantee  contracts  are 
measured, on initial recognition, at fair value.  For financial 
guarantee contracts that are not designated as at fair value 
through  profit  or  loss,  they  are,  after  initial  recognition, 
subsequently measured at the higher of: (i) the amount of 
the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
present  obligation  at  the  balance  sheet  date,  and  (ii)  the 
amount initially recognised less the cumulative amortisation 
recognised in accordance with the revenue principle.Derivative financial instruments
The  Bank  uses  derivative  financial  instruments.  Such 
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair 
value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered 
into and are subsequently measured at fair value.  Derivatives 
are  carried  as  assets  when  the  fair  value  is  positive  and 
as  liabilities  when  the  fair  value  is  negative.  However,  a 
derivative that is linked to and must be settled by delivery 
of an unquoted equity instrument (without a quoted market 
price in an active market) and whose fair value cannot be 
reliably measured, is measured at cost.Any  gains  or  losses  arising  from  changes  in  fair  value  of 
derivatives are recognised directly in profit or loss.100 大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告11. 买入返售和卖出回购交易

未来现金流量的现值两者之间较高者确定。本公司以单项资产为基础
估计其可收回金额。当资产的可收回金额低于其账面价值时，本公司将其账面价值减记至
可收回金额，减记的金额计入当期损益，同时计提相应的资产减值准
备。上述资产减值损失一经确认，在以后会计期间不再转回。14. 预计负债
除了非同一控制下企业合并中的或有对价及承担的或有负债之外，当

(i) 该义务是本公司承担的现时义务；
(ii) 该义务的履行很可能导致经济利益流出本公司；
(iii) 该义务的金额能够可靠地计量。(11) Repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions
Securities and bills sold subject to repurchase agreements 
(Repos)  continue  to  be  recognised,  and  are  recorded  as 
financial  investments.  The  corresponding  obligation  is 
included  in  “Repurchase  agreements”.  Securities  and  bills 
purchased under agreements to re-sell (Reverse repos) are 
not recognised. The receivables are recorded as “Reverse 
repurchase financial assets”, as appropriate.The difference between purchase and sale price is recognised 
as interest expense or interest income in the profit or loss 
over the life of the agreements using the effective interest 
method.(12) Precious metals
Precious metals comprise gold and silver. Precious metals 
acquired  by  the  Bank  for  trading  purposes  are  initially 
measured at fair value and subsequent changes in fair value 
are recorded in the profit or loss.(13) Impairment of assets
The Bank assesses impairment of assets as follows, except for 
financial assets and deferred tax assets:The  Bank  assesses  whether  there  is  an  indication  that  an 
asset is impaired at each financial reporting date. If any such 
indication exists, the Bank makes an estimate of the asset’s 
recoverable  amount  and  carries  out  impairment  test.  For 
those assets with infinite useful lives, regardless of whether 
the  impairment  indications  exist,  the  impairment  test  is 
made at least annually. For intangible assets that have not 
yet reached their intented use status are also conducted 
annually impairment test.An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value 
less costs to sell and the present value of estimated future 
discounted cash flows, which is determined on an individual 
basis.If the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying 
value, an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit 
or loss and the carrying value of the asset reduced by the 
amount of the loss.Once  an  impairment  loss  is  recognised,  it  shall  not  be 
reversed in a subsequent period.(14) Provisions
An  obligation  related  to  a  contingency  is  recognised  as 
provision when all of the following conditions are satisfied 
(except  for  contingent  liability  recognised  in  a  business 
combination not under common control):
(i) the obligation is a present obligation of the Bank;
(ii) it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation; and
(iii) the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 2018101预计负债按照履行相关现时义务所需支出的最佳估计数进行初始计

据表明该账面价值不能反映当前最佳估计数的，按照当前最佳估计数
对该账面价值进行调整。15. 收入及支出确认原则和方法
利息收入和利息支出
本公司利润表中的“利息收入”和“利息支出”，为按实际利率法确
认的以摊余成本计量及以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益
的金融资产和以摊余成本计量的金融负债产生的利息收入与支出。实际利率法，是指计算金融资产或金融负债的摊余成本以及将各期利
息收入或利息支出分摊计入各会计期间的方法。实际利率，是指将金
融资产或金融负债在预计存续期间的估计未来现金流量，折现为该金
融资产或金融负债当前账面价值所使用的利率。在确定实际利率时，
本公司在考虑金融资产或金融负债所有合同条款的基础上估计未来
现金流量，但不考虑预期信用损失。本公司支付或收取的、属于实际
利率组成部分的各项收费、交易费用及溢价或折价等，在确定实际利
率时予以考虑。对于购入或源生的已发生信用减值的金融资产，本公司自初始确认起，
按照该金融资产的摊余成本和经信用调整的实际利率计算确定其利息
收入。经信用调整的实际利率，是指将购入或源生的已发生信用减值
的金融资产在预计存续期的估计未来现金流量，折现为该金融资产摊
余成本的利率。对于购入或源生的未发生信用减值、但在后续期间成为已发生信用减
值的金融资产，本公司在后续期间，按照该金融资产的摊余成本和实
际利率计算确定其利息收入。手续费及佣金收入
本公司通过向客户提供各类服务收取手续费及佣金。其中，通过在一
定期间内提供服务收取的手续费及佣金在相应期间内按照履约进度确
认，其他手续费及佣金于相关交易完成时确认。The provision is initially measured at the best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the related present obligation. 
Factors  pertaining  to  a  contingency  such  as  the  risks, 
uncertainties and time value of money are taken into account 
as a whole in reaching the best estimate. The Bank reviews 
the carrying amount of a provision at the balance sheet date. 
The carrying amount of a provision will be adjusted when 
there is clear evidence that the amount does not reflect the 
current best estimate.(15) Recognition of income and expense
Interest income and expense
“Interest income” and “interest expense” item in the income 
statement of the Bank are the interest income and expense 
calculated by using the effective interest method on financial 
assets at amortised cost, financial assets at fair value through 
other  comprehensive  income  and  financial  liabilities  at 
amortised cost.The effective interest method is used in the calculation of 
the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability 
and in the allocation and recognition of the interest income 
or interest expense in profit or loss over the relevant period. 
The effective interest rate is that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash flows through the expected life of a financial 
asset  or  financial  liability  to  the  gross  carrying  amount 
of  a  financial  asset  or  the  amortised  cost  of  a  financial 
liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the 
Bank estimates the expected cash flows by considering all 
contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not 
consider expected credit losses. The calculation includes all 
amounts paid or received by the Bank that are an integral 
part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all 
other premiums or discounts.For those purchased or originated credit-impaired financial 
assets, the Bank calculates the interest income by applying 
the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised 
cost of the financial asset from initial recognition. The credit-
adjusted effective interest rate is that exactly discounts the 
estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the 
financial asset to the amortised cost of a financial asset that 
is a purchased or originated credit-impaired financial asset.For  those  financial  assets  that  are  not  purchased  or 
originated credit-impaired financial assets but subsequently 
have  become  credit-impaired  financial  assets,  the  Bank 
calculates  the  interest  income  by  applying  the  effective 
interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset in 
subsequent reporting periods.Fee and commission income
The Bank earns fee and commission income from a diverse 
range  of  services  it  provides  to  its  customers.  For  those 
services that are provided over a period of time, fee and 
commission  income  is  accrued  in  accordance  with  the 
terms and conditions of the service agreement. For other 
services, fee and commission income is recognised when the 
transactions are completed.102 大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告16. 租赁

本公司的股份支付为以权益结算的股份支付。(16) leases
Leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership of the assets to the lessees are classified as 
finance leases. Other leases are classified as operating leases.As operating lessee
When the Bank is a lessee under an operating lease, rental 
payments are charged to the profit or loss on the straight-
line basis over the lease terms.As financial lessee
When the Bank is a lessee under a finance lease, the leased 
assets are capitalised initially at the fair value of the asset or, 
if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in “Other 
liabilities”. Finance charges are charged over the term of the 
lease using an interest rate which reflects a constant rate of 
return. Contingent rental payments are charged to the profit 
or loss when incurred.(17) Government subsidies
Government  subsidies  will  be  recognised  if  the  Bank  can 
receive  government  subsidies  and  meet  the  conditions 
attached to government subsidies. If government subsidies 
are monetary assets, they shall be measured in the light of 
the amount received or receivable. If a government subsidy 
is a non-monetary asset, it shall be measured at its fair value; 
and if its fair value cannot be obtained in a reliable way, it 
shall be measured at a nominal amount.Government subsidies 
associated with income which are used as compensation for 
future costs, expenses or losses are recognized as deferred 
expenditures and shall recorded in future profits and losses 
to  reverse  the  related  costs  where  the  relevant  costs, 
expenses or losses are recognized. Government subsidies 
associated with income which are used to compensate the 
related costs, expenses or losses incurred by the Bank are 
directly included in current profit and loss or used to reverse 
the  related  costs.  Government  subsidies  associated  with 
assets shall set off the book value of related assets or be 
recognized as deferred expenditures. Government subsidies 
related to assets are recognized as deferred expenditures 
to be distributed over the useful lives of the relevant assets 
and shall be recorded in the profit or loss  by stages  in a 
reasonable and systematic manner. Government subsidies 
measured in nominal amounts, shall directly recognized in 
current profits and losses. Where relevant assets are sold, 
transferred, scraped or damaged before the end of their lives, 
balance of the unallocated deferred expenditures shall be 
recognized in current profit and loss on asset disposal.(18) Share-based payment
The Bank’s share-based compensation programme is measured 
as an equity-settled share-based payment.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 2018103以权益结算的股份支付换取员工提供服务的，以授予员工权益工具的

职工薪酬，是指本公司为获得职工提供的服务或解除劳动关系而给予
的各种形式的报酬或补偿。职工薪酬包括短期薪酬、离职后福利、辞
退福利和其他长期职工福利。短期薪酬
工资与奖金、社会保障福利及其他短期员工福利会于本公司员工提供
服务的期间计提。离职后福利（设定提存计划）
本公司的员工参加由当地政府管理的养老保险和失业保险，相应支出
在发生时计入当期损益。The  equity-settled  share-based  payment  is  measured  by 
reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. 
Where the equity instruments granted vest immediately, the 
Bank recognises the expense in full at the fair value on grant 
date with a corresponding increase in capital reserve. Where 
the equity instruments granted vest upon the fulfilment of 
service period or performance conditions, the Bank makes 
a best estimate at the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest, at each financial reporting date of the 
vesting period, based on the latest information on eligible 
employees and performance conditions, and recognise the 
expense pertaining to the current period at the fair value on 
grant date with a corresponding increase in capital reserve. 
The fair values of the equity instruments are estimated using 
the Trinomial valuation methodology.No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately 
vest, except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is 
conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which 
are treated  as vesting irrespective of  whether or not the 
market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all 
other performance and service conditions are satisfied.Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, 
as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had 
not been modified. An additional expense is recognised for 
any modification which increases the total fair value of the 
share–based  payments,  or  is  otherwise  beneficial  to  the 
employee as measured at the date of modification.Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as 
if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense 
not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. 
This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within 
the control of the employees are not met. However, if a new 
award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated 
as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the 
cancelled and new compensation are treated as if they were 
a modification of the original award.(19) Employee benefits
Employee benefits are all forms of consideration given by 
the Bank in exchange for service rendered by employees or 
for the termination of employment, including short-term 
employee benefits, post-employment benefits, termination 
benefits and other long-term benefits.Short-term employee benefits
Salaries and bonuses, social security contributions and other 
short-term employee benefits are accrued in the period in 
which services have been rendered by the employees of the 
Bank.Post-employment benefits (defined contribution plan)
Employees of the Bank participate in the retirement insurance 
plan,  and  unemployment  insurance  plan  administered  by 
the local government, and the contribution is recognised to 
profit or loss of that period.104 大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告本公司员工还可自愿参加本公司设立的企业年金计划。本公司按员工
工资的一定比例向年金计划缴款，相应支出计入当期损益。20. 所得税
所得税包括当期所得税和递延所得税。除与直接计入所有者权益的交
易或事项相关的所得税计入所有者权益外，其他所得税均计入当期损
益。本公司对于当期和以前期间形成的当期所得税负债或资产，按照税法
规定计算的预期应交纳或返还的所得税金额计量。本公司根据资产与负债于资产负债表日的账面价值与计税基础之间
的暂时性差异，以及未作为资产和负债确认但按照税法规定可以确定
其计税基础的项目的账面价值与计税基础之间的差额产生的暂时性差
异，采用资产负债表债务法计提递延所得税。各种应纳税暂时性差异均据以确认递延所得税负债。对于可抵扣暂时性差异、能够结转以后年度的可抵扣亏损和税款抵减，
本公司以很可能取得用来抵扣可抵扣暂时性差异、可抵扣亏损和税款
抵减的未来应纳税所得额为限，确认由此产生的递延所得税资产。本公司于资产负债表日，对于递延所得税资产和递延所得税负债，依
据税法规定，按照预期收回该资产或清偿该负债期间的适用税率计量，
并反映资产负债表日预期收回资产或清偿负债方式的所得税影响。于资产负债表日，本公司对递延所得税资产的账面价值进行复核。如

established  by  the  Bank  on  a  voluntary  basis.  The  Bank 
contributes  to  the  annuity  at  a  certain  percentage  of 
employees’ salary, and recognises the cost in the profit or 
loss accordingly.(20) Income tax
Income tax includes current tax and deferred tax. Current 
income  tax  and  movements  in  deferred  tax  balances  are 
recognised in profit or loss except that it relates to items 
recognised  directly  in  equity,  in  which  case  the  tax  is 
recognised directly in equity.Current  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities  for  the  current 
and  prior  periods  are  measured  at  the  amount  expected 
to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities in 
accordance with relevant tax regulations.Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, 
on  all  temporary  differences  between  the  tax  bases  of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes at the balance sheet date.Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences.Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences, carryforward of unused tax credits 
and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carryforward of unused tax 
credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax 
rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset 
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and 
tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.The  carrying  amount  of  deferred  income  tax  assets  is 
reviewed at each financial reporting date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable 
profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred 
income  tax  asset  to  be  utilised.  Unrecognised  deferred 
income tax assets are reassessed at each financial reporting 
date and are recognised to the extent that it has become 
probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred 
tax asset to be recovered.Deferred  tax  assets  and  deferred  tax  liabilities  are  offset 
when fulfilling of the following conditions:
(i) A legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities. 
(ii) The deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are 
related to the income tax levied on the same taxpayer by 
the same tax administrative department or are related to 
different taxpayers but, within each future period of reversal 
of important deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, 
the taxpayers involved intend to settle current tax assets and 
current tax liabilities or acquire assets and liquidate liabilities 
at the same time.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 201810521. 公允价值计量
本公司于每个资产负债表日以公允价值计量衍生金融工具、交易性金
融资产、其他以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产、其
他债权投资以及交易性金融负债。公允价值，是指市场参与者在计量
日发生的有序交易中，出售一项资产所能收到或者转移一项负债所需
支付的价格。本公司以公允价值计量相关资产或负债，假定出售资产
或者转移负债的有序交易在相关资产或负债的主要市场进行；不存在
主要市场的，本公司假定该交易在相关资产或负债的最有利市场进行。
主要市场 ( 或最有利市场 ) 是本公司在计量日能够进入的交易市场。
本公司采用市场参与者在对该资产或负债定价时为实现其经济利益
最大化所使用的假设。本公司采用在当前情况下适用并且有足够可利用数据和其他信息支
持的估值技术，优先使用相关可观察输入值，只有在可观察输入值无
法取得或取得不切实可行的情况下，才使用不可观察输入值。在财务报表中以公允价值计量或披露的资产和负债，根据对公允价值
计量整体而言具有重要意义的最低层次输入值，确定所属的公允价值
层次：在计量日能够取得的相同资产或负债在活跃市场上未经调整的
报价为第一层次输入值；除第一层次输入值外相关资产或负债直接或
间接可观察的输入值为第二层次输入值；相关资产或负债的不可观察
输入值为第三层次输入值。每个资产负债表日，本公司对在财务报表中确认的持续以公允价值计
量的资产和负债进行重新评估，以确定是否在公允价值计量层次之间
发生转换。22. 关联方
一方控制、共同控制另一方或对另一方施加重大影响，以及两方或两
方以上同受一方控制、共同控制或重大影响的，构成关联方。仅同受国家控制而不存在其他关联方关系的企业，不构成本公司的关
联方。23. 受托业务
本公司以被任命者、受托人或代理人等受托身份进行活动时，该委托
活动所产生的资产与该资产偿还客户的保证未包括在本报表。(21) Fair value measurement
At  each  financial  reporting  date,  the  Bank  measures  its 
derivatives,  Financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit 
or loss, other debt instrument at fair value through other 
comprehensive income and financial liabilities at fair value 
through  profit  or  loss.  Fair  value  is  the  price  that  would 
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in 
an orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on 
the assumption that the orderly transaction to sell the asset 
or transfer the liability takes place either in the principle 
market  for  the  asset  or  liability,  or  in  the  absence  of  a 
principle market, in the most advantageous market for the 
asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous 
market  must  be  accessible  to  the  Bank.  The  fair  value  of 
an  asset  or  a  liability  is  measured  using  the  assumption 
that market participants would use when pricing the asset 
or liability, assuming that market participants act in their 
economic best interest.The Bank uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in 
the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available 
to  measure  the  fair  value.  Use  of  observable  inputs  is 
maximized and unobservable inputs will only be used when 
observable inputs are not available or obtaining observable 
inputs becomes unpractical.For assets and liabilities measured and disclosed at fair value, 
the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in 
the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level 
input that is significant to the entire measurement: Level 
1  inputs  are  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  in  active  markets 
for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the 
measurement  date;  Level  2  inputs  are  inputs  other  than 
quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; Level 3 
inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.For assets and liabilities held at the end of the balance sheet 
date that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the 
Bank continues to make assessment as to whether there is 
transfer between different levels of the fair value hierarchy.(22) Related parties
Parties  are  considered  to  be  related  if  one  party  has  the 
ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or 
exercise significant influence over the other party.  Parties are 
also considered to be related if they are subject to common 
control or common significant influence.The state-owned enterprises without other relationships do 
not constitute related parties.(23) Entrusted business
Where  the  Bank  acts  in  an  entrusted  business  such  as 
nominee, custodian or agent, assets arising thereon together 
with related undertakings to return such assets to customers 
are excluded from the financial statements.106 大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告24. 或有负债
或有负债指过去的交易或者事项形成的潜在义务，其存在须通过未来
不确定事项的发生或不发生予以证实；或过去的交易或者事项形成的
现时义务，履行该义务不是很可能导致经济利益流出或该义务的金额
不能可靠计量，因此该义务不予确认。本公司对或有负债不予确认，仅在附注中加以披露。如情况发生变化
使得该事项很有可能导致经济利益的流出时，则将其确认为预计负债。25. 重大会计判断和会计估计
在本公司执行会计政策的过程中，管理层对财务报表未来不确定事项
作出了判断、估计和假设。这些判断、估计和假设会影响收入、费用、
资产和负债的列报金额及其披露。这些估计和假设的不确定性所导致
的结果可能造成对未来受影响的资产或负债的账面金额进行重大调
整。判断
在应用本公司的会计政策的过程中，管理层作出了以下对财务报表所
确认的金额具有重大影响的判断：业务模式
金融资产于初始确认时的分类取决于本公司管理金融资产的业务模
式，在判断业务模式时，本公司考虑包括企业评价和向关键管理人员
报告金融资产业绩的方式、影响金融资产业绩的风险及其管理方式以
及相关业务管理人员获得报酬的方式等。在评估是否以收取合同现金
流量为目标时，本公司需要对金融资产到期日前的出售原因、时间、
频率和价值等进行分析判断。合同现金流量特征
金融资产于初始确认时的分类取决于金融资产的合同现金流量特征，
需要判断合同现金流量是否仅为对本金和以未偿付本金为基础的利
息的支付时，包含对货币时间价值的修正进行评估时，需要判断与基
准现金流量相比是否具有显著差异、对包含提前还款特征的金融资产，
需要判断提前还款特征的公允价值是否非常小等。(24) Contingent liabilities
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from 
past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by 
the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain 
future events not wholly within the control of the Bank. It 
can also be a present obligation arising from past events that 
is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow 
of economic resources will be required or the amount of 
obligation cannot be measured reliably.The  Bank  will  not  recognise  contingent  liabilities,  but 
disclosed in the notes to financial statements. In case the 
condition changes, which led to the outflow of economic 
resources is probable, provisions will be made.(25) Significant accounting judgment and estimates
In  the  process  of  applying  the  accounting  policies,  the 
management  has  used  its  judgments  and  made  estimates 
and assumptions of the effects of uncertain future events 
on the financial statements. The use of judgments, estimates 
and assumptions will affect the amount of income, expense, 
assets and liabilities presented and disclosed. The uncertainty 
of such estimates and assumptions might have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the future.Judgment
In  the  process  of  applying  the  accounting  policies,  the 
management  make  following  judgments  which  has 
significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements:Business model
Financial assets are initially classified based on the Bank’s 
business  model  for  managing  the  financial  assets.  The 
Bank  judges  the  business  model,  with  the  consideration 
of  enterprise  evaluation,  the  reporting  mode  to  key 
management, related risk and corresponding risk management 
method  of  financial  assets  performance,  and  the  reward 
system of related business personnel. The Bank analyse and 
judge  the  reason,  timing,  frequency  and  value  of  selling 
financial assets before maturity date when judging whether 
the business model is to collect contractual cash flows or 
not.Characteristics of the contractual cash flows
Financial  assets  are  initially  classified  based  on  their 
contractual cash flow characteristics. When judging whether 
the contractual cash flow are solely payments of principal 
and  interest  on  the  principal  amount  outstanding,  the 
considerations  contain:  (i)judging  whether  there  exists 
significant difference compared with the benchmark cash 
flow, when evaluating the modification of the time value 
of  the  money,  (ii)  judging  whether  fair  value  of  the  early 
repayment characteristics is immaterial for financial assets 
with early repayment characteristics.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 2018107估计的不确定性
以下为于资产负债表日有关未来的关键假设以及估计不确定性的其他
关键来源，可能会导致未来会计期间资产和负债账面金额重大调整。可供出售金融资产减值
2018 年 1 月 1 日之前，本公司将某些资产归类为可供出售金融资产，
并将其公允价值的变动直接计入其他综合收益。当公允价值下降时，
管理层就价值下降作出假设以确定是否存在需在损益中确认其减值
损失。金融工具减值
2018 年 1 月 1 日之后，本公司采用预期信用损失模型对金融工具的
减值进行评估，应用预期信用损失模型需要做出重大判断和估计，需
考虑所有合理且有依据的信息，包括前瞻性信息。在做出该等判断和
估计时，本公司根据历史还款数据结合经济政策、宏观经济指标、行
业风险等因素推断债务人信用风险的预期变动。贷款和垫款的减值损失
2018 年 1 月 1 日之前，本公司定期判断是否有任何客观证据表明贷
款和垫款发生了减值损失。如有，本公司将估算减值损失的金额。减
值损失金额为贷款和垫款账面金额与预计未来现金流量的现值之间
的差额。估算减值损失金额时，需要对是否存在客观证据表明贷款和
垫款已发生减值损失作出重大判断，并需要对预期未来现金流量的现
值作出重大估计。除金融资产之外的非流动资产减值
本公司于资产负债表日对除金融资产之外的非流动资产判断是否存
在可能发生减值的迹象。对使用寿命不确定的无形资产，除每年进行
的减值测试外，当其存在减值迹象时，也进行减值测试。其他除金融
资产之外的非流动资产，当存在迹象表明其账面金额不可收回时，进
行减值测试。当资产或资产组的账面价值高于可收回金额，即公允价
值减去处置费用后的净额和预计未来现金流量的现值中的较高者，表
明发生了减值。公允价值减去处置费用后的净额，参考公平交易中类
似资产的销售协议价格或可观察到的市场价格，减去可直接归属于该
资产处置的增量成本确定。预计未来现金流量现值时，管理层必须估
计该项资产或资产组的预计未来现金流量，并选择恰当的折现率确定
未来现金流量的现值。108 大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告Uncertainty of estimates
The  following  items  are  the  key  hypothesis  about  the 
future and other key source of uncertainty of estimates on 
financial reporting date. It may cause significant modification 
on  carrying  amount  of  assets  and  liabilities  in  the  future 
accounting period.Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets
The  Bank  classified  a  few  financial  assets  into  available-
for-sale  financial  assets  with  their  changes  in  fair  value 
recognised in other comprehensive income before 1 January 
2018. When fair value going down, the management made 
assumption for the decline to determine whether it need to 
recognize impairment loss in profit or loss.Impairment of financial instruments
The Bank uses the expected credit loss model to evaluate 
the impairment of financial instruments since 1 January 2018. 
Applying  the  expected  credit  loss  model  need  to  make 
significant judgment and estimates with consideration of 
all reasonable information with proper basis, including the 
forward-looking information. When making those judgment 
and  estimates,  the  Bank  deduces  the  expected  changes 
of obligor’s credit risk with consideration of the historical 
repayment  data  combined  with  the  economic  policy, 
macroeconomic indicators, industry risk and etc.Impairment of loans and advances
The  Bank  determined  periodically  whether  there  was 
any  objective  evidence  that  impairment  losses  on  loans 
and advances have occurred before 1 January 2018. If any 
such  evidence  existed,  the  Bank  assessed  the  amount  of 
impairment losses. The amount of impairment losses was 
measured as the difference between the carrying amount and 
the present value of estimated future cash flows. Assessing 
the  amount  of  impairment  losses  involving  significant 
judgement on whether the objective evidence for impairment 
existed and also significant estimates when determining the 
present value of the expected future cash flows.Impairment of non-current assets besides financial assets
Non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment on financial 
reporting  date.  When  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written 
down immediately to its recoverable amount. For intangible 
assets with infinite useful lives, the impairment test is made 
annually and when impairment indications exist. For other 
non-current assets besides financial assets, the impairment 
test is made when there is an indication that their carrying 
amount is not recoverable. When the carrying amount of an 
asset or a group of assets is higher than their recoverable 
amount, i.e. higher of its fair value less costs to sell and the 
present value of estimated future discounted cash flows, it 
is indicated that the impairment losses have occurred. Fair 
value less costs to sell refers to the selling contract price 
from fair trading of similar asset or the observable market 
price, less the incremental costing directly attributes to the 
asset disposal. When estimating the present value of future 
discounted cash flows. The management must estimate the 
future cash flow of the asset or the group of assets, and choose 
a proper discount rate to determine the present value.递延所得税资产
在很可能有足够的应纳税所得额用以抵扣可抵扣亏损的限度内，应就
所有尚未利用的可抵扣亏损确认递延所得税资产。这需要管理层运用
大量的判断来估计未来取得应纳税所得额的时间和金额，结合纳税筹
划策略，以决定应确认的递延所得税资产的金额。金融工具的公允价值
对于存在活跃市场的金融工具，本公司优先采用活跃市场的报价确定
其公允价值。对于不存在活跃市场的金融工具，本公司采用估值技术
确定其公允价值。估值技术包括参考熟悉情况并自愿交易的各方最近
进行的市场交易中使用的价格、参照实质上相同的其他金融工具的当
前公允价值和现金流量折现法等。在可行的情况下，估值技术尽可能
使用市场参数。然而，当缺乏市场参数时，管理层需就自身和交易对
手的信贷风险、市场波动率、相关性等方面作出估计。这些相关假设
的变化会对金融工具的公允价值产生影响。金融工具终止确认
于金融工具转移交易中，本公司管理层需就与所转移金融工具所有权
有关的风险及报酬进行分析与判断，并根据分析的结果进行相应的账
务处理。26. 会计政策和会计估计变更
2017 年，财政部颁布了修订的《企业会计准则第 14 号——收入》( 简
称“新收入准则”)、《企业会计准则第 22 号——金融工具确认和计量》、
《企业会计准则第 23 号——金融资产转移》、《企业会计准则第 24
号——套期保值》以及《企业会计准则第 37 号——金融工具列报》( 统
称“新金融工具准则”)。本公司自 2018 年 1 月 1 日开始按照新修订
的上述准则进行会计处理，根据衔接规定，对可比期间信息不予调整，
首日执行新准则与现行准则的差异追溯调整本报告期期初未分配利润
或其他综合收益。本公司并未对新金融工具准则适用范围内所涉及的金融工具于 2017
年的比较信息进行重述。因此，本会计报表资料列示的 2018 年财务
信息与按原金融工具准则列示的 2017 年比较信息并无可比性。因采
用新金融工具准则而产生的差异已直接反映在 2018 年 1 月 1 日的所
有者权益中。Deferred income tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant 
management judgement is required to determine the amount 
of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon 
the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together 
with future tax planning strategies.Fair value of financial instruments
The Bank establishes fair value of financial instruments with 
reference to a quoted market price in an active market or, if 
there is no active market, using valuation techniques. These 
valuation techniques include the use of recent arm’s length 
transactions,  observable  prices  for  similar  instruments, 
discounted cash flow analysis using risk-adjusted interest 
rates, and commonly used market pricing models. Whenever 
possible  these  models  use  observable  market  inputs  and 
data including, for example, interest rate yield curves, foreign 
currency rates and option volatilities. The results of using 
valuation  techniques  are  calibrated  against  the  industry 
practice and observable current market transactions in the 
same or similar instruments.Derecognition of financial instruments
The  Bank  assesses  and  judges  on  the  extent  to  which  it 
retains the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial 
instruments for the transferred transactions entered into, and 
make relevant accounting treatments accordingly.(26) Change in accounting policy and estimates
MOF  issued  the  revised  principles  of  The  Accounting 
Standards  for  Business  Enterprises  No.14  –  revenue 
(hereinafter  referred  to  as  “new  revenue  principle”),  The 
Accounting  Standards  for  Business  Enterprises  No.22  - 
Recognition  and  Measurement  of  Financial  Instruments, 
The Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No.23 - 
Transfers of Financial Assets, The Accounting Standards for 
Business Enterprises No.24 – Hedging and The Accounting 
Standards  for  Business  Enterprises  No.37  –  Presentation 
of Financial Instruments (collectively referred to as “new 
financial instrument principle”) in 2017. The Bank has early 
adopted those revised accounting standards since 1 January 
2018. To link up with the previous version of the standard, 
the comparative amounts is not adjusted and the difference 
on  the  first  implementation  date  between  the  revised 
accounting standard and the prior accounting standard is 
retrospectively adjusted on the opening retained earnings 
and other comprehensive income.The  Bank  doesn’t  adjust  the  comparative  figures  of  the 
financial statement according to new financial instrument 
principle.  Since  the  difference  caused  by  new  financial 
instrument  principle  is  retrospectively  adjusted  on  the 
opening retained earnings and other comprehensive income, 
the  financial  data  in  2018  is  not  comparable  with  the 
comparative amounts in 2017 based on the previous financial 
instrument principle.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 2018109新收入准则
新收入准则为规范与客户之间的合同产生的收入建立了新的收入确
认模型。根据新收入准则，确认收入的方式应当反映主体向客户转让
商品或提供服务的模式，收入的金额应当反映主体因向客户转让该等
商品和服务而预计有权获得的对价金额。同时，新收入准则对于收入
确认的每一个环节所需要进行的判断和估计也做出了规范。本公司于
2018 年 1 月 1 日起施行新的收入准则，该准则不适用于与金融工具
相关的收入，因此，执行新收入准则对 2018 年 1 月 1 日资产负债表
项目没有重大影响。新金融工具准则
新金融工具准则改变了金融资产的分类和计量方式，确定了三个主要
的计量类别：摊余成本；以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益；
以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益。企业需考虑自身业务模式，
以及金融资产的合同现金流特征进行上述分类。新金融工具准则要求金融资产减值计量由“已发生损失模型”改为“预
期信用损失模型”，适用于以摊余成本计量的金融资产、以公允价值
计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的金融资产，以及贷款承诺和财务担
保合同。New revenue principle
New  revenue  principle  builds  a  new  revenue  recognition 
model  for  standardizing  the  recognition  of  revenue  from 
contracts  with  customers.  According  to  new  revenue 
principle, the revenue recognition method should reflect 
the  goods  transfer  mode  or  service  provision  mode  to 
customers, the revenue amount should reflect the expected 
consideration  amount  collected  from  goods  transfer  or 
service  to  customers.  Meanwhile,  new  revenue  principle 
standardizes the judgment and estimates which are necessary 
for  each  step  of  revenue  recognition.  The  Bank  has  early 
adopted  new  revenue  principle  since  1  January  2018.  The 
principle is not applicable for the revenue from financial 
instruments, thus the adoption of new revenue principle has 
no significant impact on the balance sheet on 1 January 2018.New financial instrument principle
New financial instrument principle modifies the classification 
and  measurement  methods  of  financial  assets,  and 
establishes  three    categories  for  measurement:  financial 
assets at amortised cost, financial assets at fair value through 
other  comprehensive  income,  and  financial  assets  at  fair 
value  through  profit  or  loss.  An  entity  needs  to  classify 
financial assets with consideration of its business model and 
the contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets.New financial instrument principle requires that the measurement 
of impairment of a financial asset be changed from "incurred 
loss model" to "expected credit loss model" and this way of 
measurement applies to financial assets at amortised cost, 
financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income,  and  loan  commitments  and  financial  guarantee 
contracts.110 大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告于首次执行日，金融资产按照修订前后金融工具确认计量准则的规定

require  the  Bank  to  be  obliged  to  fulfil  the  customers’ 
responsibility as guarantor in case that the customers fail to 
repay the contracted amount or fail to fulfil their obligations.Loan commitments represent the commitment made by the 
Bank to its customer to grant a certain amount of loan in the 
future. Loan commitments are normally attached with an 
effective date or termination clause, and it is possible that 
the Bank may not need to fulfil such commitment on the 
maturity date. Hence, the amount of the loan commitments 
does  not  necessarily  represent  the  future  expected  cash 
outflow.

Financial Risk Management本公司在日常活动中面临各种金融工具的风险，主要包括是信用风险、
流动性风险及市场风险 ( 包括汇率风险、利率风险 )。本公司的主要
金融工具包括货币资金、存放中央银行款项、存放同业款项、拆出资金、
衍生金融资产、买入返售金融资产、发放贷款和垫款、其他债权投资等。
与这些金融工具相关的风险，以及本公司为降低这些风险所采取的风
险管理策略如下所述。本公司的金融工具导致的主要风险是信用风险、流动性风险及市场风
险。本公司对此的风险管理政策概述如下。1. 信用风险
1.1 信用风险管理
信用风险是债务人或交易对手违约的风险，主要指银行的借款人或交
易对手不能按事先达成的协议履行其义务的潜在可能性。本公司的信
用风险主要来自于发放贷款和垫款，表外项目的信用风险主要来自于
开出信用证、各项担保款项和贷款承诺。信用风险的集中程度：当一定数量的客户在进行相同的经营活动时，
或处于相同的地理位置上或其行业具有相似的经济特性使其履行合约
的能力会受到同一经济变化的影响。信用风险的集中程度反映了银行
业绩对某一特定行业或地理位置的敏感程度。The Bank is exposed to different types of risks. The most 
significant types of risk related to financial instuments are 
credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk(including foreign 
exchange  risk  and  interest  rate  risk).  The  Bank’s  financial 
instruments mainly include cash, deposit with the Central 
Bank,  due  from  banks  and  other  financial  institutions, 
placements  with  banks  and  other  financial  institutions, 
derivative financial assets, reverse repurchase financial assets, 
Loans and advances to customers, other debt instrument 
at fair value through other comprehensive income, and etc. 
These risks and the Banks strategy to minimize the negative 
impacts of the underlying financial risks are described below.The most significant types of risks to the Bank are credit risk, 
liquidity risk and market risk. The Bank's risk management 
strategy is outlined below.(1) Credit risk
(1.1) Credit risk management
Credit  risk is  the  risk  of loss  arising  from  a  borrower’s  or 
counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations as and when 
they fall due. The Bank’s credit risk exposure mainly arises from 
loans and advances to customers. Credit risk of off balance 
sheet items mainly arises from the letters of credit/guarantees 
issued as well as loan commitments.Credit risk concentration refers to the situation whereby 
there is a concentration of customers in the same business 
activities,  geographical  location,  or  industry  sector  with 
similar economic characteristics such that their repayment 
ability would be affected by the same economic fluctuations. 
Credit risk concentration reflects the sensitivity of the Bank’s 
performance to such customer concentration.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 2018147本公司严格的授信前审查制度、授权审批制度和贷后的跟踪和上报机
制有效地降低和防范了信用风险。本公司定期对客户的经营状况进行
检查，对贷款质量进行分析并提取充足的贷款损失准备金。财务担保及贷款承诺产生的风险在实质上与贷款和垫款的风险相似。
因此，该类交易的申请、贷后管理以及抵质押担保要求等需要与贷款
和垫款业务相同。2018 年信用风险显著增加判断标准本公司在每个资产负债表日评估相关金融工具的信用风险自初始确
认后是否已显著增加。在确定信用风险自初始确认后是否显著增加
时，本公司考虑在无须付出不必要的额外成本或努力即可获得合理
且有依据的信息，包括基于本公司历史数据的定性和定量分析、外
部信用风险评级以及前瞻性信息。本公司以单项金融工具或者具有
相似信用风险特征的金融工具组合为基础，通过比较金融工具在资
产负债表日发生违约的风险与在初始确认日发生违约的风险，以确
定金融工具预计存续期内发生违约风险的变化情况。当触发以下一个或多个定量、定性标准或上限指标时，本公司认为
金融工具的信用风险已发生显著增加：
—  定量标准主要为报告日内部评级较前一年下迁超过一定级数
—  定性标准主要为债务人经营或财务情况出现重大不利变化、行业
风险程度、预警客户清单等
—  上限指标为债务人合同付款 ( 包括本金和利息 ) 逾期超过 30 天已发生信用减值资产的定义为确定是否发生信用减值，本公司所采用的界定标准，与内部针对
相关金融工具的信用风险管理目标保持一致，同时考虑定量、定性
指标。本公司评估债务人是否发生信用减值时，主要考虑以下因素：
—  发行方或债务人发生重大财务困难；
—  债务人违反合同，如偿付利息或本金违约或逾期等；
—  债权人出于与债务人财务困难有关的经济或合同考虑，给予债
务人在任何其他情况下都不会做出的让步；The Bank establishes a comprehensive set of policies and 
procedures  which  effectively  mitigate  and  control  credit 
risk. The procedures cover credit evaluation, credit approval, 
credit monitoring as well as reporting.  The Bank reviews the 
borrowers’  business  operations  periodically,  analyses  the 
quality of credit portfolio and ensures adequacy of loan loss 
provisions.The  risk  from  financial  guarantee  and  loan  commitments 
is similar with that from loans and advances to customers. 
Hence, the Bank adopts the same policies and procedures 
for managing credit contingencies which cover application, 
follow-up monitoring and collateral requirements, etc.2018Judgment criteria of significant increase in credit riskThe  Bank  assesses  whether  or  not  the  credit  risk  of  the 
relevant  financial  instruments  has  increased  significantly 
since the initial recognistion at each financial reporting date. 
While  determining  whether  the  credit  risk  has  increased 
significantly since the initial recognistion, the Bank takes in to 
account the reasonable and supportable information that is 
available without undue cost or effort, including qualitative 
and quantitative analysis based on the Bank's historical data, 
external credit risk rating and forward-looking information. 
Based  on  a  individual  financial  instrument  or  a  group  of 
financial instruments with similar credit risk characteristics, 
the Bank compares the risk of default of financial instruments 
at the financial reporting date with that at initial recognistion 
date to determine the change of default risk of financial 
instruments during their expected lifetime.When triggering one or more of the following quantitative, 
qualitative  or  backstop  criteria  have  been  met,  the  Bank 
considers that the credit risk of financial instruments has 
increased significantly:
-Quantitative  criteria  are  that  internal  ratings  at  the 
financial reporting date have been downgraded by more 
than a certain series compared with the previous year.
Qualitative criteria includes significant adverse changes 
in the debtor's business or financial situation, industry risk 
level, be listed in the watch-list, etc.
The backstop criteria limit is that the debtor's contract 
payment (including principle and interest) are overdue for 
more than 30 days.--The definition of the credit-impaired financial assetsIn order to determine whether a financial assets is credit-
impaired is consistent with the internal credit risk management 
objective.  Taking  into  account  both  quantitative  and 
qualitative criteria. When assessing whether the debtor has 
suffered credit impairment, the Bank mainly considers the 
following factors:
-Significant financial difficulties of the issuer or debtor.
A breach of contract by the obligor, such as a default or 
delinquency in interest or principal payments, and etc.
The  creditor  granting  to  the  obligor,  for  economic  or 
legal reasons relating to the obligor’s financial difficulty, 
a  concession  that  the  creditor  would  not  otherwise 
consider.-

对不同的资产分别以 12 个月或整个存续期的预期信用损失计量减值
准备。预期信用损失计量的关键参数包括违约概率、违约损失率和
违约风险敞口。本公司考虑历史统计数据 ( 如交易对手评级、担保
方式及抵质押物类别、还款方式等 ) 的定量分析及前瞻性信息，建
立违约概率、违约损失率及违约风险敞口模型。相关定义如下：
—   违约概率是指债务人在未来 12 个月或在整个剩余存续期，无法
履行其偿付义务的可能性。本公司的违约概率以信贷周期指数 Z 值
为基础进行调整，加入前瞻性信息，以反映当前宏观经济环境下债
务人违约概率；
—   违约损失率是指本公司对违约风险暴露发生损失程度作出的预
期。根据交易对手的类型、追索的方式和优先级，以及担保品的不同，
违约损失率也有所不同。违约损失率为违约发生时风险敞口损失的
百分比；
—   违约风险敞口是指，在未来 12 个月或在整个剩余存续期中，在
违约发生时，本公司应被偿付的金额。前瞻性信息信用风险显著增加的评估及预期信用损失的计算均涉及前瞻性信息。
本公司通过进行历史数据分析，识别出影响各行业、各业务类型信用
风险及预期信用损失的关键经济指标。这些经济指标对违约概率和违约损失率的影响，对不同的行业、业务
类型有所不同。本公司在此过程中应用了宏观数据及专家判断开展分
析，形成预测模型以及分析范式，每年定期获取新的输入数据，并按
照规范考量专家建议，将前瞻性因素作用于违约概率和违约损失率的
计算过程中。Depending  on  whether  the  credit  risk  has  significantly 
increased  and  whether  the  asset  is  credit-impaired,  the 
Bank  measures  the  impairment  provision  for  different 
assets with expected credit loss of 12 months or lifetime, 
respectively.  The  key  parameters  of  expected  credit  loss 
measurement include probability of default(PD), loss given 
default(LGD) and exposure at default(EAD). The Bank takes 
into account the quantitative analysis of historical statistics 
(such as ratings of counterparties, manners of guarantees and 
types of collaterals, repayments, etc.) and forward-looking 
information in order to establish the models for estimating 
PD, LGD and EAD.Relative definitions are listed as below:
-The probability of default refers to the possibility that 
the  debtor  will  not  be  able  to  fulfil  its  obligation  of 
repayment in the next 12 months or the whole remaining 
lifetime. The Bank’s PD is adjusted based on the credit 
cycle index Z and forward-looking information to reflect 
the default probability of the debtor under the current 
macroeconomic environment.
The loss given default refers to the Bank’s expectation of 
the extent of the loss resulting from the default exposure. 
Depending on the type of counterparty, the method and 
priority of the recourse, and the type of collaterals, the 
LGD varies. The loss given default is the percentage of risk 
exposure loss when default occurs.
The  exposure  at  default  is  the  amount  that  the  Bank 
should be reimbursed in the next 12 months or throughout 
the remaining lifetime when the default occurs.--Forward-looking information
 
The assessment of significant increases in credit risk and the 
calculation of expected credit losses both involve forward-
looking information. Through the analysis of historical data, 
the Bank identifies the key macroeconomic indicators that 
affect  the  credit risk  and  expected  credit loss  of  various 
industries and business types.The impact of these economic indicators on probability of 
default and loss given default varies according to different 
types  of  industries  and  business  types.  The  Bank  applies 
experts’  judgement in this analysis, according to the result 
of  experts’  judgement,  the Bank predicts  these  economic 
indicators on a quarterly basis and determines the impact of 
these economic indicators on the probability of default and 
the loss given default by conducting regression analysis.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 20181491.2 不考虑任何担保物及其他信用增级措施的最大信用风险敞口

The concentration of borrowers/counterparties in the same 
industry  sector,  geographical  location  or  having  similar 
economic characteristics would tend to pose higher credit 
risk to the Bank. On the other hand, the level of credit risk 
may be varied from each industry or geographical location in 
view of their unique economic development characteristics.The  Bank  mainly  provides  loans  and  commitments/
guarantees  to  domestic  customers.  Analysis  on  industry 
sector concentration for the Bank’s loans and advances can 
be found at Note 6. 7.2.(1.4) Collateral
The  amount  and  type  of  the  collateral  required  would 
depend on the credit risk of the borrowers/counterparties 
as assessed by the Bank. The Bank has established a guideline

loans should be recognised as impaired loans. These loans 
are classified as “Substandard”, “Doubtful” or “Loss”.As at the balance sheet date, the carry amount of impaired 
loans and the fair value of collateral of impaired loans held

况对最新可得的外部评估价值进行调整的基础上确定。经重组的发放贷款及垫款
本公司为了最大可能地回收贷款及管理客户关系，设立了贷款重组
政策，即与客户重新商定合同条款。于资产负债表日，本公司并未发生此类业务。2. 流动性风险
本公司保持充足的流动性以保障银行日常运营的开展，满足存款的
提款和贷款的发放，投资新项目以及支付到期的借款。因此，流动
性管理的主旨在于应付银行确定的及不可确定的资金需求。本公司流动性风险管理是在完整的风险管理框架下进行的，包含经
由资产负债委员会和执行委员会批准的各项政策、控制流程、风险
限额。这些政策、控制流程及风险限额确保本公司在不同的市场环
境下有充足的资金以应对流动性需求。这些措施包括通过多样化资
金的来源及其期限将资金集中度降至最小，以及持有高流动性债券。本公司在流动性风险管理方面采取保守立场，持续的吸收核心存款，
严格遵守流动性风险额度，保留充足的流动资产等措施来防范可能
出现的资金短缺。本公司通过主动分散存款的来源，以保持成本效率的均衡，资金的
持续可获得以及资金来源的多样化。通过竞争性定价管理银行的核
心存款以及维护客户的信心。本公司通过预测银行现金流来度量和管理流动性风险，现金流的预
测是基于“正常业务情景”和“压力情景”来进行。本公司设置现
金流错配限额来控制银行流动性风险敞口的同时，还采用流动性早
期预警指标和警戒线以揭示可能出现的危机状况。本公司在建立的
流动性应急计划中运用一系列的预警指标揭示可能发生的流动性危
机。在该应急计划中，本公司通过设立危机上报流程及包括融资、
沟通等危机处理策略来减少流动性危机所带来的负面影响。The fair value of collateral that the Bank holds is determined 
from the latest external valuation with necessary adjustment 
made  after  considering  the  Bank’s  own  experience  in 
collateral disposal as well as the current market conditions.Restructured loans and advances
The Bank has formulated a set of loan restructuring policies 
to renegotiate the contractual terms with customers in order 
to maximise the recovery of impaired loans as well as to 
manage customer relationships.No  transactions  were  conducted  by  the  Bank  as  at  the 
balance sheet date.(2) Liquidity risk 
The  Bank  maintains  sufficient  liquidity  to  fund  day-to-
day  operations,  to  meet  deposit  withdrawals  and  loan 
disbursements, to participate in new investments, and to 
repay borrowings. Hence, liquidity is managed in a manner 
to address both anticipated and unanticipated cash funding 
needs.Liquidity  risk  is  managed  in  accordance  with  a  complete 
framework of risk management, including-policies, controls 
and limits approved by the Asset and Liability Committee 
(ALCO). These policies, controls and limits are established 
to ensure that the Bank to have sufficient funding to manage 
liquidity risk over a range of market conditions. These include 
minimising excessive funding concentrations by diversifying 
the  sources  and  terms  of  funding  as  well  as  maintaining 
a portfolio of debt securities with high quality and good 
liquidity.The Bank takes a conservative stance in liquidity management 
by continuing to gather core deposits, strictly complying 
with liquidity limits and retaining adequate liquid assets to 
prevent any possible cash shortfall.The  Bank  actively  dispersed  the  sources  of  deposits  to 
maintain a balance of cost efficiency, continued availability 
of funds and diversification of funding sources. Important 
factors  in  ensuring  liquidity  are  competitive  pricing, 
proactive management of the bank’s core deposits and the 
maintenance of customer confidence.Liquidity risk is measured and managed on projected cash 
flow basis. Cash flow projection is monitored under both 
business-as-usual and stress scenarios. Cash flow mismatch 
limits are established to limit the bank’s liquidity exposure. 
The  bank  has  also  employed  liquidity  early  warning 
indicators and trigger points to signal possible contingency 
situations.  Contingency  funding  plans  have  been  set  up 
to  identify  potential  liquidity  crises  by  using  a  series  of 
warning indicators. Crisis management processes and various 
strategies including funding and communication have been 
developed to minimise the negative impact of any liquidity 
crunch.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 2018153计

83. 市场风险
本公司面临的市场风险主要来自利率和汇率产品的敞口头寸。本公
司的交易性业务及非交易性业务均可产生市场风险。本公司市场风
险管理的目标是避免收入和权益由于市场风险产生的过度损失，同
时降低本公司受金融工具内在波动性风险的影响。本公司由风险管理部总览全行的市场风险敞口，并负责拟制相关市
场风险管理政策报送资产负债委员会和执行委员会批准，并定期将
银行市场风险敞口汇报给资产负债委员会和董事会风险管理委员
会。本公司按照既定标准和当前管理能力监管市场风险，其主要的监管
方法包括敏感性分析，风险价值，压力测试等。在新产品或新业务
上线前，该产品和业务中的市场风险将按照规定予以辨识。本公司根据不同账户的各自特点将表内外资产负债划分为交易账户
或银行账户。交易账户主要包括因交易目的或者是为规避交易账户
其他项目风险而持有的可自由交易的金融工具和商品头寸。交易账
户中的市场风险取决于交易的工具，包括利率、汇率、信贷利差、
商品价格、外汇波动率等。银行账户包括除交易账户外的其他金融
工具。银行账户中的主要风险是利率和信贷利差风险。3.1 汇率风险
主要是由于本公司资产和负债的货币错配以及外汇交易无法及时规
避风险敞口以至于暴露于市场波动而引起的风险。(3) Market risk
The  Bank  is  exposed  to  market  risk  mainly  from  foreign 
exchange rate and interest rate related products arising from 
trading as well as non-trading businesses. The objective of 
market risk management is to minimise the negative impact 
of volatility of financial instruments on the Bank’s earnings 
and equity.The Risk Management Division monitors the Bank’s market 
risk  exposure  and  formulates  market  risk  policies  for 
approval by the Asset Liability Committee and the Executive 
Committee. Risk profile reports are submitted to the Asset 
Liability Committee and Board Risk Management Committee 
on a regular basis.The Bank measures and manages its market risk in accordance 
with a framework of policies and practices which include 
sensitivity  analysis,  Value-at-Risk  measure,  stress  testing 
etc. In addition, the market  risk associated with any new 
product/business is required to be identified and addressed 
prior to launch.The  Bank  divides  the  balance  sheet  assets  and  liabilities 
into  the  trading  book  or  banking  book  according  to  the 
characteristics of different accounts. Trading book mainly 
includes free trading financial instruments and commodity 
positions held for the purpose of trading or for avoiding the 
risk of other items in the transaction account. The market 
risk in trading book depends on the tools of the transactions, 
including  interest  rates,  exchange  rates,  credit  spreads, 
commodity  prices  and  foreign  exchange  volatility,  etc. 
Banking book includes other financial instruments outside 
the trading book. The main risk in the banking book is the risk 
of interest rates and credit spreads.(3.1) Currency risk 
The  Bank’s  currency  risk  arises  mainly  from  currency 
mismatches  of  assets  and  liabilities  as  well  as  foreign 
exchange trading business whereby the open positions are 
subject to exchange rate fluctuations.156 大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告于 2018 年 12 月 31 日，本公司的有关资产及负债按币种列示如下：As at 31 December 2018, the Bank’s assets and liabilities by

shows the impact of a change in other currency rates against 
RMB on the Bank’s profit before tax, given other variables 
remain constant.The analysis is based on below assumptions:
(1)   Exchange rate sensitivity refers to the gains and losses 
caused by one per cent change of the closing rate (mid 
rate) of the different foreign currencies against RMB as at 
the balance sheet date;(2)    Exchange rate fluctuation refers to the fluctuation againstRMB in the same direction simultaneously;(3)    Off-balance sheet items are excluded.Due  to  the  above  assumptions,  the  actual  impact  of 
exchange rate fluctuation on the Bank’s earnings may differ 
from above sensitivity analysis.(3.2) Interest rate risk
Trading Book
The Bank currently adopts the Standardised Approach for 
the calculation of regulatory market risk capital but uses the 
Internal Models Approach to measure and to control trading 
market risks.The Bank adopts a daily VaR(VaR-Value at Risk) to estimate 
market risk within a 99 per cent confidence interval using 
the historical simulation method for its trading book. The 
method assumes that possible future changes of risk factors 
such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity 
prices may be implied by observed historical data.Although VaR is an significant tool to measure market risk, 
there are some restrictions on the assumptions of the model, 
such as:-In most cases, the hypothesis that warehouse hedging 
or sale can be carried out within the observation period 
of one trading day is reasonable, however, in the case of 
severe liquidity shortage in the market for a long time, 
the observation period hypothesis of one trading day may 
not be in line with the actual situation;UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 2018159——————99% 的置信水平并不反映在这个水平以外可能引起的亏损。甚

VaR 按当日收市基准计算，并不反映交易当天持仓可能面对的
风险；

所有可能情况，特别是例外事项。
风险价值 (VaR) 是计量潜在损失的统计测量方法，通过回溯测试

loss that may arise outside this level. Even in the model 
used, there is a one per cent possibility that the actual 
loss will exceed VaR;
VaR is calculated according to the closing benchmark of 
the day, which does not reflect the risk that the position 
may face on the trading day; and
Historical data, used as a benchmark for determining the 
possible range of future outcomes, may not apply to all 
situations, especially exceptions.
As  VaR  is  the  statistical  measure  for  potential  losses, 
the VaR measures are backtested against profit and loss 
of  the  trading  book  to  validate  the  robustness  of  the 
methodology. The backtesting process analyses whether 
the exceptions are due to model deficiencies or market 
volatility. All backtesting exceptions are tabled at the ALCO 
with recommended actions and resolutions.
To  complement  the  VaR  measure,  the  Bank  perform 
stress and scenario tests to identify the vulnerability to 
event risk.These tests serve to provide early warnings of 
plausible extreme losses for which proactive management 
of market risk is taken.
As at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, the daily 
VaR of the Bank is RMB5.67 million and RMB5.34 million, 
respectively.Banking book
The ALCO maintains oversight of the effectiveness of the 
interest rate risk management structure. The Balance Sheet 
Risk  Management  (BSRM)  Division  supports  the  ALCO  in 
monitoring the interest rate risk profile of the banking book.The  primary  objective  of  interest  rate  risk  management 
is  to  protect  and  to  enhance  capital  or  economic  net 
worth through adequate, stable and reliable growth in net 
interest earnings under a broad range of possible economic 
conditions.Banking book interest rate risk exposure is quantified using 
analysis  tools  include  repricing  schedules  and  sensitivity 
analysis. They provide indications of the potential impact of 
interest rate changes on interest income and economic value 
through the analysis of the sensitivity of assets and liabilities 
to changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity varies 
with different repricing periods, currencies and embedded 
options  mismatches  in  the  longer  tenor  will  experience 
greater impact in the price-value of interest rate positions 
than similar positions in the shorter tenor.The Bank also performs quantitative analysis method of net 
interest income and economic value of net assets regularly 
to determine the adequacy of capital in meeting the impact 
of extreme interest rate movements on the balance sheet. 
Such  tests  are  also  performed  to  provide  early  warnings 
of  potential  extreme  losses,  facilitating  the  proactive 
management of interest rate risks in an environment of rapid 
financial market changes.The risks arising from the trading book, such as interest rates, 
foreign exchange rates and equity prices are managed and 
controlled under the market risk framework.于 2018 年 12 月 31 日，本公司银行账户包含的所有的资产及负债按合

assets and liabilities have static interest rate risk structure. 
It  reflects  the  impact  of  interest  rate  movement  on  the 
Bank’s net interest income over a one-year period. The key 
assumptions are as follows:(1)  All assets and liabilities with re-pricing date less than 
three months or between three months and one year are 
assumed to be re-priced in the middle of the respective 
time bucket;(2)  Yield curve shifts in parallel with interest rate change;(3)  Assets and liabilities are not subject to other changes;and(4)    Off-balance sheet items except derivative financial 
        instruments.Due  to  the  above  assumptions,  the  actual  impact  of  net 
interest income from interest rate movement may differ from 
above sensitivity analysis.(4) Fair value of financial instrumentsFair  value  is  the  price  that  would  be  received  to  sell  an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between  market  participants  at  the  measurement  date. 
Subject  to  the  existence  of  an  active  market,  such  as  an 
authorised securities exchange, the market value is the best 
reflection of the fair value of financial instruments.  As there 
is no available market value for some of the financial assets 
and liabilities held and issued by the Bank, the discounted 
cash  flow  method  or  other  valuation  methods  described 
below  are  adopted  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  these 
assets and liabilities.  However, the value determined by such 
methods would depend on the amount of future cash flows, 
time period assumption and discount rates used.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 2018163所采用之方法及假设如下：The  following  methods  and  assumptions  are  used  in 
estimating fair values:(i)  以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产 / 金融负债
（包括衍生金融资产 / 金融负债）乃参考可供参照之市价计算
其公允价值。倘无可供参照之市价，则将现金流量折现估算公
允价值或参照交易对方的报价确定公允价值。公允价值等于此
等项目之账面金额；(i)Financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss 
(including derivative assets/liabilities) are stated at fair 
value by reference to the quoted market prices when 
available.  If quoted market prices are not available, the 
fair value is estimated using discounted cash flows or 
quoted  price  from  the  counter  parties.  The  carrying 
amounts of these items reflect the fair value as at the 
balance sheet date;(ii)  The fair values of other financial assets and liabilities 
maturing within 12 months are assumed to be equal to 
their carrying amounts in view of their short maturity;(iii)  The fair value of fixed rate loans priced at market rate 
at the time the loans are extended shall be determined 
using prevailing market rates of similar loans. Changes 
in the credit quality of loans within the portfolio are 
not  taken into account in determining  the  fair values 
as the impact of credit risk is recognised separately as 
impairment provision which shall be deducted from the 
carrying amounts and fair value;(iv)  Customer  deposits  are priced based  on  fixed rate  or 
floating rate depending on the product type.  The fair 
value of demand deposits and saving deposits without 
specific maturity date is determined based on the amount 
payable on demand.  The fair value of fixed deposits are 
estimated using discounted cash flows method with the 
prevailing deposit rate for the remaining tenor of the 
fixed deposit as the discount rate.The method of determining a fair value in the Bank can be 
categorised into two main approaches:(i)  Mark to Market - where the valuation uses independentunadjusted quoted market prices;(ii)  Mark to Model - where valuation techniques are used todetermine the valuation.Valuation adjustments are an integral part of the fair value 
process that  requires the exercise of  judgment to  ensure 
correct  fair  value  representation.  In  making  appropriate 
valuation adjustments, the Bank follows the methodologies 
that  consider  factors  such  as  bid-offer  spread  valuation 
adjustment and model valuation adjustment.The  Bank  has  established  internal  control  procedures 
over the valuation process to provide assurance over the 
appropriateness  of the fair values  applied. If fair value is 
determined  by  valuation  models,  the  assumptions  and 
techniques within the models are independently validated 
by a specialist group. In addition, price and parameter inputs, 
assumptions  and  valuation  adjustments  are  subject  to 
verification and review processes. Other valuation control 
includes review and analysis of daily profit and loss.(ii)  于 12 个月内到期之其他金融资产金融负债由于期限较短，它们的账面价值与公允价值相若；(iii)  凡定息贷款按当时适用于类似贷款之市场利率贷出，其公允价
值以参照市场利率方法估算。贷款组合中信贷质量之变化在确
定总公允价值时不予考虑，因为信贷风险之影响将单独作为贷
款损失，从账面值及公允价值中扣除；(iv)  客户存款乃按不同品种使用固定或浮动利率。活期存款及无指
定届满期之储蓄账户假设结算日按通知应付金额为公允价值。
有固定期限之存款的公允价值以现金流量折现法估算，折现率
为与该定期存款的剩余期限对应的现行存款利率。本公司确定公允价值的方法可以归结为以下两种：(i)     市值计价：计价是运用独立并未经调整的市场报价；(ii)    估值计价：计价是运用估值技术进行估值。估值调整作为实现公允价值的一个必要组成，要求根据客观情况，
对交易价格进行调整以确保公允价值的准确性。本公司遵循的估值
调整方法考虑到不同的因素，例如买卖价差估值调整和模型估值调
整，以确保计价的合理有效。本公司建立了内部控制机制来确保公允价值的合理性。如果采用模
型式估值，模型中的假设和技术都会事先经过独立专家小组的专门
验证。此外，模型中的价格、输入参数、假设和估值调整方法都会
经过核实和复查。其他的估值控制还包括复核和分析日常盈亏。164 大华银行（中国）有限公司 2018 年度报告本公司将所有进行公允价值估值的金融产品划分为三个层次：第一层次：公开市场价格
这种估值技术运用相同资产和负债的活跃市场报价得出估值金额。
被归纳此层次的金融产品包括由中央国债登记结算有限公司每日公
布市场价格的债券。第二层次：估值输入参数可以通过市场观察得到的估值技术
这种估值方式是通过标准模型确定，而输入的主要参数都能在市场
上直接观察。这种技术包括现金流折现分析、期权定价模型和一些
市场参与者普遍使用和接受的技术。被纳入这个层次的金融产品主
要为外汇远期，外汇互换，贵金属远期 / 互换及柜台交易的衍生
品（如货币市场拆借、利率互换、外汇期权、买断式转贴现），并
包括公允价值由交易对手提供的金融产品（如背对背对冲结构性产
品）。第三层次：当主要参数不能直接观察得到时采用的估值技术
这种估值技术运用合理市场假设的基础上获取主要不可观察参数。
目前本公司还没有相关的金融产品被归纳在这个层次。以上各假设及方法乃为本公司资产及负债之公允价值提供一致之计
算准则。然而，由于其他机构或会使用不同之方法及假设，各金融
机构所披露之公允价值未必完全具有可比性。The Bank classifies all the fair value instruments according to 
the following hierarchy:Level 1: Quoted market price
This  valuation  technique  uses  recent  unadjusted  quoted 
prices  for  identical  assets  or  liabilities  in  active  markets 
where the price represents actual and regularly occurring 
market  transactions  on  an  arm’s  length  basis.  Financial 
instruments included in this class are bonds with the marked-
to-market prices actively made available and announced by 
China Central Depository and Clearing Co. Ltd.Level 2: Valuation technique using observable inputs
This valuation technique is used for financial instruments 
where  the  prices  are  derived  from  standard  valuation 
models, and significant inputs to these models are directly 
observable.  The  valuation  techniques  include  the  use  of 
discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and 
other  valuation  techniques  widely  used  and  accepted  by 
market  participants.  The  financial  instruments  included 
in this category are mainly foreign exchange forward and 
foreign exchange swaps, precious metals forward and swaps, 
and  OTC  derivatives  (namely  money  market  deposit  and 
placement,  interest  rate  swap,  FX  option,  rediscounted 
bills) and financial instruments with fair value derived from 
counterparty (for structured products arranged on back-to-
back basis).Level 3: Valuation technique with significant non-observable 
inputs 
This  valuation  technique  is  used  where  at  least  one 
significant input is not observable and reliance is placed on 
reasonable assumptions made on market conditions. There is 
currently no financial instrument being classified under such 
category.All the assumptions and methods mentioned above provide 
a consistent basis for the calculation of fair value of the 
Bank’s assets and liabilities.  However, other institutions may 
use different assumptions and methods.  Therefore, the fair 
values disclosed by different financial institutions may not be 
entirely comparable.UNITED OVERSEAS BANK (CHINA) LIMITEDANNUAL REPORT 2018165下表列示了以公允价值计量的金融工具的公允价值层次：The  following  table  shows  the  fair  value  hierarchy  of
