告002Chairman's SpeechIn 2020, in the face of the double impact brought by the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and the severe and complex economic situation, under the 
correct leadership of CPC committees, governments and regulatory departments at all levels and the strong support from various social sectors, Qishang Bank adhered 
to the general principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability, was fearless of difficulties, strived for progress, got determined to reform, worked hard in a 
down-to-earth way, achieved steady development in various businesses, and created the best performance in main business indicators. By the end of 2020, the Bank

of Commercial Banks and other regulatory requirements, continuously strengthened the capacity-building of the Board of Directors to perform its duties, and further 
improved the effectiveness of corporate governance. The Bank fully implemented the procedural prerequisite for research and deliberation of the CPC Committee, and 
effectively highlighted the leading core position of the CPC organization in the corporate governance structure. The Bank supplemented three shareholder directors, 
increased the number of Independent Directors in the special committees under the Board of Directors so that the member structure of the Board of Directors

of shareholder governance, the Board of Directors, the Board of Supervisors and senior management governance, the Bank organized the implementation of self-
examination and evaluation of corporate governance, summarized the experience, and identified gaps, providing the latest basis for the continuous improvement 
of corporate governance. The Bank continuously improved the level of equity management, strictly controlled the access as shareholders, effectively evaluated the 
operation and management status of shareholders, and took the initiative to prevent relevant risks. The Bank continued to promote equity trusteeship within the year, 
and conducted equity management in a more reasonable and standardized way. By the end of 2020, the Bank had completed the trusteeship registration of all equity 
and the confirmation of 98% of its equity. The Bank continuously strengthened the management of connected transactions, grasped the changes of related parties 
in time, supplemented and identified the list of related parties, and did a good job in the management of related parties dynamically and comprehensively. The Bank 
carried out the management of connected transactions according to relevant laws and regulations, submitted relevant information to the connected transaction 
supervision system in time, and launched the module "Shareholder and Related Party Management" in the credit management system, effectively preventing the

drawing on the experience of peers and combining with its own reality, the Bank took firm steps in all-round reform, broke through the major bottleneck restricting 
its development and achieved substantive positive results. In view of the contradiction between the demand for excellent talents in reform and development and the 
insufficient support of existing human resources, on the one hand, the Bank widely recruited nearly 90 new employees from society in the second half of the year; on 
the other hand, the Bank selected outstanding officers and employees internally to form a three-level "talent pool", providing a strong guarantee for the construction, 
selection and appointment of talent echelon in the future; moreover, the Bank formulated the policy about reasonable early retirement and job transfer to encourage 
the early retirement and job transfer of officers and employees who meet the standards, forming a normalization mechanism, thus further optimizing the human 
resource structure. According to the idea of "strengthening the Head Office", the Bank highlighted the line control and front-office marketing, enriched the front-
office department, strengthened the middle-office department, and streamlined the back-office department, providing an institutional guarantee for improving 
the "management, guidance, support and service" ability of the Head Office. Under the principle of "introducing competition mechanism and improving decision 
efficiency", the Bank established a branch-level institution in Zibo and merged 6 sub-branches in the downtown of the city, further shortening the management 
radius, optimizing the setup of outlets and stimulating the internal living force. The Bank vigorously cultivated the "credit culture" of "dedicated to work, responsibleIQ

Solid progress was made in reform and transformation.During the reporting period, according to the macroeconomic and financial situation and the actual development situation, the Bank effectively implementedthe medium-term development plan, broke through the major bottleneck restricting its development, and achieved substantial results. Firstly, the transformation andreform were full of vitality. By earnestly summarizing and deeply analyzing the gap from other banks and its shortcomings, the Bank drew on the experience of thepeer banks and took firm steps in all-round reform on the basis of its own actual conditions. In view of the contradiction between the demand for outstanding talentsin reform and development and the lack of existing human resources, on the one hand, the Bank widely attracted talents from society, and selected outstandingofficers and employees internally to form a three-level "talent pool", providing a strong guarantee for the construction, selection and appointment of talent echelonin the future; on the other hand, the Bank established a scientific and reasonable policy of internal withdrawal and job transfer, further optimizing the HR structure.According to the idea of "strengthening the Head Office", the Bank highlighted the line control and front-office marketing, enriched the front-office department,strengthened the middle-office department, and streamlined the back-office department, providing an institutional guarantee for improving the "management,guidance, support and service" ability of the Head Office. Under the principle of "introducing competition mechanism and improving decision efficiency", the Bankestablished a branch-level institution in Zibo and merged 6 sub-branches in the downtown of the city, further shortening the management radius, optimizingthe setup of outlets and stimulating the internal living force. The Bank vigorously cultivated the "credit culture" of "dedicated to work, responsible for work, strictin accountability and full coverage", focused on shaping the "benchmarking culture" of "establishing standards, checking standards and achieving standards" andthe "employment culture" of "open, fair and impartial", continued to promote the "culture of diligence" and the "culture of execution" encouraging officers andemployees to work hard with entrepreneurship, actively did practical work and provided good benefits for the whole staff, so as to further enhance their sense ofbelonging, cohesion and centripetal force. Secondly, the structural adjustment was reasonable. The Bank adhered to the marketing idea of "organized, large-scaleand high-level", so the special marketing activities achieved positive results. The Bank reached comprehensive strategic cooperation with some leading municipalenterprises, signed strategic cooperation agreements with some high-quality domestic enterprises, and continuously optimized the credit business and customerstructure. Adhering to the idea of "running retail business as wholesale business", the Bank deeply and thoroughly enhanced its supply chain finance, fully completedthe regulatory indicators of "two increases and two controls", and therefore was awarded the "Excellent Competitive Supply Chain Financial Bank 2020". The numberof valid credit cards, credit line and transaction amount all increased steadily, and thereby the Bank won the "Annual Credit Card Business Development Award" andIQ

告058险，并获取充分、适当的审计证据，作为发表审计意见的基础。由于舞弊可能涉及串通、伪造、故意遗漏、虚假陈述或凌驾于内部控制之上，未能发现由于舞弊导致的重大错报的风险高于未能发现由于错误导致的重大错报的风险。(2)  了解与审计相关的内部控制，以设计恰当的审计程序，但目的并非对内部控制的有效性发表意见。(3) 评价管理层选用会计政策的恰当性和作出会计估计及相关披露的合理性。(4) 对管理层使用持续经营假设的恰当性得出结论。同时，根据获取的审计证据，就可能导致对齐商银行持续经营能力产生重大疑虑的事项或情况是否存在重大不确定性得出结论。如果我们得出结论认为存在重大不确定性，审计准则要求我们在审计报告中提请报表使用者注意财务报表中的相关披露；如果披露不充分，我们应当发表非无保留意见。我们的结论基于截至审计报告日可获得的信息。然而，未来的事项或情况可能导致齐商银行不能持续经营。(5) 评价财务报表的总体列报（包括披露）、结构和内容，并评价财务报表是否公允反映相关交易和事项。(6) 就齐商银行中实体或业务活动的财务信息获取充分、适当的审计证据，以对合并财务报表发表审计意见。我们负责指导、监督和执行集团审计，并对审计意见承担全部责任。我们与治理层就计划的审计范围、时间安排和重大审计发现等事项进行沟通，包括沟通我们在审计中识别出的值得关注的内部控制缺陷。立信会计师事务所（特殊普通合伙）                        中国注册会计师：中国·上海中国注册会计师：2021年4月28日IQ

T111Part VI · Financial Accounting ReportI.  Audit ReportTo all the shareholders of QISHANG BANK CO., LTD.,Audit ReportXHSBZ [2021] No. ZH30028I. Audit Opinions
We have audited the financial statements of QISHANG BANK CO., LTD. (hereinafter referred to as "QISHANG BANK"), including the consolidated balance sheet 
and the parent company's balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, consolidated income statement and the parent company's income statement, consolidated cash 
flow statement and the parent company's cash flow statement, consolidated statement of change in shareholders' equity and the parent company's statement of 
shareholders' equity change as well as notes to relevant financial statements in 2020.In our opinion, the attached financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Accounting Standard for Business Enterprises in all material aspects, 
and have given a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position and the parent company's financial position of QISHANG BANK as of December 31, 2020, as 
well as its consolidated and operational performance and cash flow and the parent company's operating performance and cash flow in 2020.II. Basis of Audit Opinions
We have conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing for Certified Public Accountants of China. The section "Responsibilities of CPAs 
for Audit of Financial Statements" herein further clarifies our responsibilities under these standards. In accordance with the Chinese Code of Professional Ethics for 
Certified Public Accountants, we are independent of QISHANG BANK and have fulfilled other responsibilities in terms of professional ethics. We believe that the audit 
evidences we have obtained are sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.III. Responsibilities of the Management and Governance for Financial Statements
The management of QISHANG BANK (hereinafter referred to as "the management") is responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
the provisions of the Accounting Standard for Business Enterprises to achieve fair reflection and design, implement and maintain necessary internal control, so that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error.In preparing the financial statements, the management is responsible for assessing the capability of QISHANG BANK to sustainably operate, disclosing matters 
related to continuous operation (if applicable) and applying the assumption of continuous operation, unless there is a plan for liquidation, termination of operation or 
no other realistic choice.The governance is responsible for supervising the financial reporting process of QISHANG BANK.IV. CPA's Responsibility for Audit of Financial Statements
Our aim is to distinguish whether or not there are material misstatements due to fraud or error in such financial statement for reasonable assurance, and to 
issue the audit report with qualified audit opinions. Reasonable assurance is of high-level commitments; however, we are not assured of discovering each material 
misstatement during our audit in pursuance of audit standards. Misstatement may be incurred from fraud or error. In general, a misstatement is material as long as 
it is likely to, through reasonable anticipation, influence the economic decision-making made by the users of financial statements in accordance with the financial 
statements, individually or in a consolidated manner.We utilize our professional judgement and keep due professional skepticism during our audit in accordance with audit standards. Meanwhile, we also carry outthe work as follows:(1) identifying and evaluating the risks of material misstatement of financial statements due to fraud or error, design and implement audit procedures to cope 
with these risks, and acquire sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as the basis to express our audit opinions. The fraud may involve in collusion, forgery, intentional 
omission, false statement or transcendence over internal control, so that the risks of failure to identify material misstatement arising from fraud are higher than those 
from error.(2) understanding the internal control for audits to design the appropriate audit procedures rather than express opinions on the effectiveness of internal control.齐

whether there is significant uncertainty in the matters or circumstances that may cause significant doubts about the continuous operation capability of QISHANG 
BANK in accordance with the audit evidences obtained. If we come to the conclusion that there is significant uncertainty, the auditing standards require us to draw the 
attention of users to the relevant disclosure in the financial statements in the audit report; if the disclosure is not sufficient, we should issue a non-unqualified opinion. 
Our conclusion is based on the information available as of the audit report date. However, the future events or circumstances may cause QISHANG BANK's failure in 
continuous operation.(5) evaluating the overall presentation (including disclosure), structure and contents of financial statements, as well as whether the financial statements reflectrelevant trades and matters sufficiently.(6) obtaining sufficient and appropriate audit evidences on the financial information of entities or business activities in QISHANG BANK to express audit opinions

Common control, referring to the common control on an economic activity as specified in the contract, exists only under the unanimous agreement among the 
investors when they see the necessity to share the control over important financial and operating strategies related to the economic activity. Where the Company, 
together with other joint venture parties, exercises joint control over the invested entity and has rights to the net assets of the invested entity, the invested entity 
should be the joint venture of the Company.Significant influence refers to the right to participate in the decision-making of an enterprise's financial and operational decisions, but it cannot control or jointly 
control the formulation of these policies with other parties. If significant influence could have been exerted on the invested entity, it is the associate enterprise of the 
Company.2. Determination of Initial Investment Cost
(1) Long-term Equity Investment Formed by Enterprise Merger
Enterprise merger under the same control: If the Company pays cash, transfers non-cash assets or bears debts and issues equity securities as the merger 
consideration, the share of the book value of the owner's equity of the merged party in the final controller's consolidated financial statements on the merger date 
should be taken as the initial investment cost of the long-term equity investment.(2) Long-term Equity Investment Obtained by Other Mean
For long-term equity investment obtained by cash payment, the purchase price actually paid should be taken as the initial investment cost.
For long-term equity investment obtained by issuing equity securities, the fair value of the equity securities issued should be taken as the initial investment cost.3. Subsequent Measurement and Profit and Loss Recognition Method
(1) Long-term Equity Investment Accounted by the Cost Method
The Company's long-term equity investment in its subsidiaries should be accounted by the cost method. In addition to the price actually paid or the cash 
dividends or profits declared but not yet distributed in the consideration when the investment is obtained, the Company should recognize the current investment 
income according to the cash dividends or profits declared and distributed by the invested entity.(2) Long-term Equity Investment Accounted by the Equity Method
The long-term equity investment in joint ventures and associates should be accounted by the equity method. The difference between the initial investment cost 
and the fair value of the invested entity's identifiable net assets should not be adjusted for long-term equity investment; the difference between the initial investment 
cost and the fair value of the invested entity's identifiable net assets should be included in the profit and loss of the current period.(XI) Fixed Assets齐

告1261. Recognition Conditions of Fixed Assets
Fixed assets refer to tangible assets held for the purpose of producing goods, providing labor services, leasing or operating management, and with a service life ofmore than one accounting year. Fixed assets should be recognized when the following conditions are met simultaneously:(1) The economic benefits related to the fixed assets are likely to flow into the enterprise;
(2) The cost of the fixed assets can be reliably measured.2. Depreciation Methods of Various Fixed Assets
The depreciation of fixed assets is classified and accrued by the straight-line depreciation method, and the depreciation rate is determined according to the 
category of fixed assets, expected service life and expected net residual value rate. If the service life of each component of the fixed assets is different or economic 
benefits are provided to the enterprise in different ways, different depreciation rates or depreciation methods are selected to accrue depreciation respectively.For the fixed assets rented by means of financing leasing, if the ownership of the leased assets can be reasonably determined to be obtained at the end of 
the leasing term, depreciation should be accrued within the remaining service life of the leased assets; if the ownership of the leased assets cannot be reasonably 
determined to be obtained at the end of the leasing term, they should accrue depreciation in the shorter term between the leasing term and the remaining service life 
of the leased assets.The depreciation periods of main fixed assets are as follows:Category of assets                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Depreciation periodHousing & buildingsElectronic equipmentMachinery equipmentTransportation facility and others(XII) Construction in Process30 years3 years5 years5 yearsThe project under construction regards the necessary expenditure incurred before the construction of the asset reaches the expected serviceable condition as the 
entry value of fixed assets. If the construction in progress of fixed assets has reached the expected serviceable condition, but the final accounts for completion have 
not yet been handled, the fixed assets should be transferred into according to the estimated value of the project budget, cost or actual cost of the project from the 
date of reaching the expected serviceable condition, and the depreciation of fixed assets should be accrued according to the depreciation policy of fixed assets of the 
Company. After the final accounts for completion have been handled, the original estimated value is adjusted by actual cost, but the depreciation amount that has 
been accrued is not adjusted.(XIII) Intangible Assets1. Valuation Method of Intangible Assets
(1) Initial measurement is made at cost when the Company obtains intangible assets;
(2) Subsequent measurement
Analyze and judge the service life of intangible assets while being obtained.
Intangible assets with a limited service life should be amortized according to the straight-line method within the period of bringing economic benefits to theenterprise; intangible assets with an uncertain service life should not be amortized if the period of bringing economic benefits to the enterprise cannot be predicted.IQ

T1272. Service Life Estimation of Intangible Assets
At the end of each period, review the service life and amortization method of intangible assets.3. Accrual of Impairment Reserve of Intangible Assets
Intangible assets with a definite service life with obvious sign of impairment should conduct an impairment test at the end of the period.
Intangible assets with an uncertain service life should conduct an impairment test at the end of each period.
Intangible assets are tested for impairment and the recoverable amount is estimated.
Once the impairment loss of intangible assets is recognized, it will not be returned in the later accounting period.(XIV) Long-term Asset ImpairmentFor long-term assets such as long-term equity investment, investment real estate measured by cost mode, fixed assets, construction in progress, intangible assets 
with signs of impairment on the balance sheet date, an impairment test should be conducted. If the impairment test result shows that the recoverable amount of the 
said long-term assets is lower than the book value, the assets impairment reserve will be accrued based on the difference and included in the current profits or losses. 
The recoverable amount will be determined according to the fair value of the asset deducted by the disposal expense, or the present value of the expected future cash 
flow derived by the asset, whichever is higher. The Company calculates and confirms the asset impairment reserve based on each single asset, or the group of assets 
to which a single asset belongs if it is difficult to estimate the recoverable value of such asset. A group of assets is the smallest group of assets that is able to generate 
independent cash flow.(XV) Other Assets1. Long-term Unamortized Expenses
Long-term unamortized expenses refer to all expenses that have been paid but should be borne by the current period and later periods with an apportionmentperiod of more than one year (excluding).2. Debt Assets
The debt assets should be entered in the account at the fair value at the time of acquisition, and the difference between the fair value and the book value ofrelevant assets and the taxes paid should be included in the current gains and lossesWhen disposing debt assets, if the disposal income obtained is greater than the book value of debt assets, the difference should be included in non-operating 
income; if the disposal income obtained is less than the book value of debt assets, the difference should be included in non-operating expenditures; the expenses 
incurred in the custody process should be directly included in other operating expenditures. The expenses incurred in the disposal process should be deducted from 
the disposal income.3. Other Receivables
The Company conducts accounting for details according to the items of other receivables and the other organizations (individuals). The Company regularly 
analyzes the recoverability of other receivables. When the recoverable amount of receivables is lower than its book value, the asset impairment reserve is accrued and 
included in the current gains and losses.(XVI) Employee Remuneration1. Accounting Handling Method of Short-term Remuneration
During the accounting period when employees provide services to the Company, the Company recognizes the short-term remuneration actually incurred asliabilities and includes it in the current gains and losses or related asset costs.During the accounting period when employees provide services to the Company, for the social insurance premium and housing provident fund paid by the齐

告128Company for employees as well as the labor union funds and employee education funds withdrawn according to the regulations, the corresponding employee 
remuneration amount should be calculated and determined according to the specified accrual basis and proportion.For the employee welfare which is non-monetary, if it can be reliably measured, it should be measured at the fair value.2. Accounting Handling Method of After-service Welfare
(1) Defined Contribution Plan
The Company pays basic pension insurance and unemployment insurance for employees in accordance with relevant regulations of the local government. During 
the accounting period when employees provide services to the Company, the amount payable is calculated according to the payment base and proportion specified 
by the local government, recognized as a liability and included in the current gains and losses or related asset costs.In addition to the basic pension insurance, the Company has also established an enterprise annuity plan in accordance with relevant policies of the national 
enterprise annuity system. The Company should pay to the annuity plan in a certain proportion of the total wages of employees, and the corresponding expenditures 
should be included in the current gains and losses or related asset costs.(2) Defined Benefit Plan
According to the formula determined by the expected cumulative welfare unit method, the Company attributes the welfare obligations arising from the definedbenefit plan to the period during which employees provide services, and includes them in the current gains and losses or related asset costs.(3) Accounting Handling Method of Dismissal Welfare
When the Company cannot unilaterally withdraw the dismissal welfare due to the termination of labor relations plan or reduction proposal, or recognize the 
costs or expenses related to the reorganization involving the payment of dismissal welfare (whichever is earlier), the Company should recognize the employee benefit 
liabilities arising from the dismissal welfare and include them in the current gains and losses.(XVII) Revenue RecognitionRevenue is recognized when relevant economic benefits are likely to flow into the Company and the amount can be reliably measured, and other recognitionconditions of the following different types of revenue are met.1. Interest Income
The interest income of financial assets should be included in the current gains and losses according to the time of transferring the right to use funds and the 
actual interest rate. Interest income includes the amortization of discount or premium. When there is no significant difference between the actual interest rate and the 
contract interest rate, the latter is selected.When impairment loss is recognized for a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets, the interest rate used to recognize the interest income is the interestrate used to discount the future cash flow when measuring the impairment loss2. Handling Fee and Commission Income
When providing relevant services, the handling fee and commission income should be recognized according to the principle of the accrual system.
The handling fees incurred in asset trading, or participating in asset trading transactions (such as purchase of customer loans, securities, or sale business) by thethird parties should be recognized at the completion of relevant transactions.3. Dividend Income

T(XVIII) Deferred Income Tax Assets and Deferred Income Tax Liabilities129For the deductible temporary difference, the deferred income tax assets should be recognized to the extent of the taxable income that is likely to be obtained inthe future to offset the deductible temporary difference. The Company confirms the deferred income tax assets derived from the deductible temporary difference, the 
deductible loss that may be carried forward to future years and the tax deduction to the extent of the income tax payable in future.For taxable temporary differences, recognize deferred income tax liabilities, except for special circumstances.
Special circumstances of not recognizing deferred income tax assets or deferred income tax liabilities include: Initial recognition of goodwill: other transactions ormatters that do not affect accounting profit or taxable income (or deductible loss) at the time of occurrence other than enterprise merger.When the Company has the legal right to settle at a net amount and intends to settle at a net amount or obtain assets and pay off liabilities, the current incometax assets and current income tax liabilities should be presented at the net amount after offset.When the Company has the legal right to settle the current income tax assets and current income tax liabilities at a net amount, and the deferred income tax 
assets and deferred income tax liabilities are related to the income tax levied by the same tax collection and management authority on the same tax entity or different 
tax entities, but in future, the taxpaying entity intends to settle the current income tax assets and liabilities with a net amount, or obtain assets and pay off liabilities 
during each period when significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities are transferred back, the deferred income tax assets and liabilities should be presented 
at the net amount after offset.(XIX) Entrusted BusinessThe Company generally manages assets for trust institutions, other institutions and retail customers as the entrustee in entrusted business. The assets involved inentrusted business do not belong to the Company, so they are not included in the financial statements of the Company.Entrusted loan refers to the loan that is entrusted by the Company, funded by the customer (as the entrustor), issued and supervised by the Company (as the 
entrustee) according to the loan object, purpose, amount, term and interest rate determined by the entrustor, and recovered with the assistance of the Company. The 
risk should be borne by the entrustor. The Company only charges handling fee for entrusted loan business and does not advance funds on behalf of others and bear 
the credit risk.(XX) Debt RestructuringDebt restructuring refers to the matters that the Company, as the creditor, makes concessions in accordance with the agreement reached with the debtor or the 
court decision in case of financial difficulties of the debtor. The ways of debt restructuring mainly include: (I) paying off debts with assets; (II) converting debts into 
capital; (III) modifying other debt conditions; (IV) combination of the above three, etc.If the debt is paid off in cash, the Company should include the difference between the book balance of the restructured right of credit and the cash received in the 
current gains and losses. If the Company has made impairment reserve for the right of credit, the difference should be offset against the impairment reserve first, and 
the part that the impairment reserve is insufficient for offset should be included in the current gains and losses.Where non-cash assets are used to pay off debts, the Company should enter the transferred non-cash assets in the account at their fair value, and the difference 
between the book balance of the restructured right of credit and the fair value of the transferred non-cash assets should be handled in accordance with the regulations 
of paying off debts in cash.Where the debt is converted into capital, the Company should recognize the fair value of shares as the investment for the debtor, and the difference between thebook balance of the restructured right of credit and the fair value of shares should be handled in accordance with the regulations of paying off the debt in cash.In case of modification of other debt conditions, the Company should take the fair value of the right of credit after modification of other debt conditions as the 
book value of the restructured right of credit, and the difference between the book balance and the book value of the restructured right of credit should be handled 
according to the regulations of paying off the debt in cash. If the modified debt terms involve contingent receivables, the Company will not recognize the contingent 
receivables and include them in the book value of the restructured right of credit.Where debt restructuring is done in a combination of paying off debts in cash, paying off debts in non-cash assets, converting debts into capital and modifying 
other debt conditions, the Company should, in turn, offset the book balance of the restructured right of credit by the received cash, the fair value of non-cash assets 
and the fair value of shares enjoyed by creditors, and then make disposal in accordance with the regulations of modifying other debt conditions.齐
