Bank had three branches (Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou) and DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd. 
(“DBS  HK”)  had  two  branches  (Shenzhen  and  Suzhou)  in  the  People’s  Republic  of  China 
(“PRC”)  (collectively  known  as  the  “Former  Branches”).  On  22  December  2006,  the  Bank 
obtained  an  approval  from  the  China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission  (“CBRC”)  to  be 
incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of DBS Bank by consolidating the two branches of 
DBS  Bank  (Beijing  and  Guangzhou)  and  two  branches  of  DBS  HK  (Shenzhen  and  Suzhou).

initial registered/paid-up capital of the Bank was RMB 4 billion. Pursuant to the approval from 
CBRC on 21 August 2012(Yin Jian Fu(2012)No.429), the Bank increased its registered paid-up 
capital  to  RMB  6.3  billion.The  Bank  obtained  a  new  business  license  No.1116082  from  the 
Shanghai’s State Administration of Industry and Commerce on 24 September 2012. Pursuant 
to  the  approval  from  CBRC  on  9  September  2016  (Hu  Yin  Jian  Fu(2016)No.382),  the  Bank

license No.00000002201609290009 from the Shanghai’s  State Administration of Industry  and 
Commerce on 29 September 2016.

(1)STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR BUSINESS 
ENTERPRISES 
 
The financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2017 are in compliance 
with the  Accounting  Standards  for  Business  Enterprises,  and  truly  and  completely  present  the 
financial position of the  Bank as of 31 December  2017 and  of the financial performance, cash 
flows and other information for the year then ended.PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
Accounting period 
 
The Bank’s accounting period starts on 1 January and ends on 31 December. 
 
Functional currency 
 
The  Bank’s  financial  statements  are  presented  in  Renminbi  (“RMB”),  which  is  its  functional 
currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operates.Foreign currency translation 
 
Transactions in foreign currencies are measured using the spot exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction. 
 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into RMB at the 
spot  exchange  rate  as  at  the  balance  sheet  date.  Foreign  exchange  differences  arising  from 
this translation are recognised in the income statement.  
 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at cost in a foreign currency are translated using 
the  spot  exchange  rate  at  the  date  of  the  transaction.  Contributions  to paid-in capital  made  in 
foreign  currencies  are  translated  into  the  RMB  denominated  paid-in  capital  account  at  the 
stipulated exchange rate at the contribution date.Cash and cash equivalents 
 
For  the  purposes  of  the  cash  flow  statement,  cash  and  cash  equivalents  comprise  assets 
balances with original maturities of three months or less  from the date of acquisition including: 
cash  on  hand,  non-restricted  balances  with  central  banks,  deposits  with  other  banks  and 
placements with financial institutions.Financial assets and financial liabilities 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
 
This category includes: financial assets and financial liabilities held for trading, derivatives and 
those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception. 
 
A financial asset or a financial liability is classified as held for trading if it is acquired or incurred 
principally for the purpose of selling, repurchasing or redemption in the near term or if it is part 
of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is 
evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Derivatives (including derivatives 
embedded  in  other  contracts  but  separated  for  accounting  purposes)  are  also  categorised  as 
held for trading unless they are designated as hedges in accordance with (Note 4 (H)).  
 
Financial assets or financial liabilities except for hybrid instruments are designated at fair value 
through profit or loss when:104

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES(continued) 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities(continued) 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss(continued) 
 
  Doing  so  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  measurement  or  recognition  inconsistenciesthat would otherwise arise;  Certain financial assets or financial liabilities portfolios that are managed and evaluated on 
a  fair  value  basis  in  accordance  with  a  documented  risk  management  or  investment 
strategy and reported to key management personnel on that basis.Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss(continued) 
 
Financial  assets  or  financial  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  measured  at  fair 
value at the initial recognition and subsequent balance sheet dates,  and changes in fair  value 
and the transaction costs are reported in income statement.Loans and receivables 
 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments 
that are not quoted in an active market, including deposits with the central bank, deposits with 
other  banks,  placements  with  financial  institutions,  financial  assets  purchased  under  resale 
agreements, loans and advances and investment securities classified as loans and receivables. 
When the Bank provides funds or services directly to customers and does not intend to sell the 
receivables, the Bank classifies such financial assets as loans and receivables and recognises 
them  at  fair  value  plus  transaction  costs  at  initial  recognition.  At  subsequent  balance  sheet 
dates,  such  assets  are  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  effective  interest  method  less  any 
impairment allowances. 
 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
 
Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are those that are either designated as such or 
are not classified in any of the other categories. The Bank also holds such financial assets for 
the  purpose of  investment  or  satisfying  regulatory  liquidity  requirements.  They  are intended  to 
be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or 
changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices. Financial assets in this category are 
held  in  certain  business  segments  as  well  as  the  liquidity  management  unit.  Such  financial 
assets are recognized at fair value plus related transaction costs at time of acquisition, and are 
subsequently measured at fair value at balance sheet dates. Unrealised gains or losses arising 
from changes in fair value of financial assets classified as available-for-sale financial assets are 
recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income and  accumulated directly  in  equity  after  deducting 
tax  impact.  When  sold  or  impaired,  the  accumulated  fair  value  adjustments  previously 
recognised in equity are reclassified to the income statement. 
 
Other financial liabilities 
 
Other financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value, being their issuance proceeds net 
of  transaction  costs  incurred.  They  are  subsequently  stated  at  amortized  cost  and  any 
difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognized in 
the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.11DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

Financial assets and financial liabilities(continued) 
 
De-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities 
 
Financial assets are derecognized when: (1) the rights to receive cash flows from the financial 
assets  have  expired;  (2)  the  financial  assets  are  transferred  and  the  Bank  has  transferred 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership; (3) the Bank does not transfer or retain nearly 
all the risks and rewards relating to the ownership of the financial asset, but the Bank waives its 
control  over  the  financial  assets.  When  financial  assets  are  derecognized,  the  difference 
between  carrying  amount  and  accumulated  amount  of  fair  value  that  was  directly  booked  into  
equity  (refer  to  transfer  available-for-sale  financial  assets)  was  booked  into  profit  or  loss. 
Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are extinguished - that is, when the obligation is 
discharged, canceled or expires. When derecognized, the difference between carrying amount 
and received amount was booked into profit or loss. 
 
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities 
 
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between 
knowledgeable,  willing  parties  in  an  arm's  length  transaction.  The  fair  values  of  quoted 
investments  in  active  markets  are  based  on  current  bid  prices.  A  financial  instrument  is 
regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from 
an  exchange,  dealer,  broker,  industry  group,  pricing  service  or  regulatory  agency,  and  those 
prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. If 
the market for a financial asset is not active, the Bank establishes fair value by using valuation 
techniques. 
 
Valuation 
transactions  between 
knowledgeable,  willing  parties,  if available,  reference  to  the  current  fair  value  of  another 
instrument  that  is  substantially  the  same,  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  and  option  pricing 
models.  
 
Impairment of financial assets 
 
Assets carried at amortised cost 
 
The Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is evidence that a financial asset 
or  a  group  of  financial  assets  is  impaired.  A  financial  asset  or  a  group  of  financial  assets  is 
impaired  and  impairment  losses  are  incurred  if,  and  only  if,  there  is  objective  evidence  of 
impairment  as  a  result  of  one  or  more  events  that  occurred  after  the  initial  recognition  of  the 
asset  and  that  loss  event  has  an  impact  on  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  of  the  financial 
asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. The criteria that the Bank uses 
to determine whether there is evidence of an impairment loss include:include  using  recent  arm'stechniqueslength  market(i)    Significant  financial  difficulty  of  the  issuer  or  obligor  ,  including  breach  of  covenantsand/or financial conditions;(ii)   a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments;(iii)  granting of a concession to the borrower, for economic or legal reasons relating to theborrower's financial difficulty, that the Bank would not otherwise consider;(iv)  it  becoming  probable  that  the  borrower  will  enter  bankruptcy  or  other  financialreorganisation;124F(1)DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES(continued) 
 
Impairment of financial assets (continued)Assets carried at amortised cost (continued)(v)  the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financialdifficulties of the issuer;(vi)  observable  data  indicating  that  there  is  a  measurable  decrease  in  the  estimatedfuture  cash  flows  from  a  group  of  financial  assets  since  the  initial  recognition  of  those 
assets,  although  the  decrease  cannot  yet  be  identified  with  the  individual  financial 
assets in the group.The  Bank  first  assesses  whether  objective  evidence  of  impairment  exists  individually  for 
financial  assets  that  are  individually  significant,  and  individually  or  collectively  for  financial 
assets that are not individually significant. If the Bank determines that no objective evidence of 
impairment  exists  for  an  individually  assessed  financial  asset,  whether  significant  or  not,  it 
includes  the  asset  in  a  group  of  financial  assets  with  similar  credit  risk  characteristics  and 
collectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment 
and  for  which  an  impairment  loss  is  or  continues  to  be  recognized  are  not  included  in  a 
collective assessment of impairment. 
 
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and 
the  present  value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows  (excluding  future  credit  losses  that  have  not 
been  incurred)  discounted  at  the  financial  asset’s  original  effective  interest  rate.  The  carrying 
amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the 
loss is recognized in income statement. In practice, the Bank will also determine the fair value 
of the financial assets  with the  observed market value and assessed the  impairment loss with 
that fair value. 
 
The  calculation  of  the  present  value  of  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  of  a  collateralized 
financial asset reflects the  cash flows that may result  from foreclosure less costs for obtaining 
and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable. 
 
For the  purposes of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial  assets are  grouped on the 
basis of similar and relevant credit risk characteristics. Those characteristics are relevant to the 
estimation  of  future  cash  flows  for  groups  of  such  assets  by  being  indicative  of  the  debtors’ 
ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated. 
 
Future  cash  flows  in  a  group  of  financial  assets  that  are  collectively  evaluated  for  impairment 
are estimated on the basis of the contractual cash flows of the assets in the group and historical 
loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the group. Historical 
loss  experience  is  adjusted  on  the  basis  of  current  observable  data  to  reflect  the  effects  of 
current conditions that did not affect the period on which the historical loss experience is based 
and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not exist currently. 
 
The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly 
by the Bank to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. 
 
When a loan is uncollectible, it is written off against the related allowance for loan impairment. 
Such  loans  are  written  off  after  all  the  recovery  procedures  have  been  exhausted  and  the 
amount  of  the  loss  has  been  determined.  Recoveries  in  full  or  in  part  of  amounts  previously 
written  off  are  credited  to  the  amount  of  the  impairment  losses  for  loans  and  advances  in  the 
income statement.134

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES(continued) 
 
Impairment of financial assets (continued)  
 
Assets carried at amortised cost (continued) 
 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can 
be  related  objectively  to  an  event  occurring  after  the  impairment  was  recognized  (such  as  an 
improvement  in  the  debtor’s  credit  rating),  the  previously  recognized  impairment  loss  is 
reversed  by  adjusting the allowance account.  The  amount of  the  reversal  is  recognized in the 
income statement. 
 
Assets classified as available-for-sale 
 
The  Bank  assesses  at  each  balance  sheet  date  whether  there  is  objective  evidence  that  a 
financial  asset or  a group  of financial assets  is  impaired. In the case of investments classified 
as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its 
cost is considered in determining whether the assets are impaired.  
 
If  any  such  evidence  exists  for  available-for-sale  financial  assets,  the  cumulative  loss, 
measured  as  the  difference  between  the  acquisition  cost  and  the  current  fair  value,  less  any 
impairment  loss  on  that  financial  asset  previously  recognized  in  the  income  statement,  is 
removed from owner’s equity and recognized in the income statement. 
 
If,  in  a  subsequent  period,  the  fair  value  of  a  debt  instrument  classified  as  available-for-sale 
increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment 
loss  was  recognized  in  the  income  statement,  the  impairment  loss  is  reversed  through  the 
income statement.  
 
Impairment losses recognized in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed 
through the income statement. But impairment losses on equity instruments that are not quoted 
in  an  active  market  and  are  not  reliably  estimated  with  fair  value,  or  impairment  losses  on 
derivative assets set off by delivering equity instruments can not be reversed. 
 
Offsetting financial instruments 
 
Financial assets and liabilities are presented net when:(i)  There is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts;  
 
(ii)  there  is  an  intention  to  settle  them  on  a  net  basis,  or  realize  the  asset  and  settle  theliability simultaneously.Derivative financial instruments 
 
Derivatives  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  at  which  a  derivative  contract  is 
entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. Gain or losses from changes 
in the fair value are recorded in the income statement.The  best  evidence of  the  fair  value of  a derivative  at  initial  recognition is  the transaction  price 
(i.e., the fair value of the consideration given or received) unless the fair value of the instrument 
is  evidenced  by  comparison  with  other  observable  current  market  transactions  in  the  same 
instrument (i.e., without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose 
variables  include  only  data  from  observable  markets.  When  such  evidence  exists,  the  Bank 
recognises profits or losses on day 1.14DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

HPRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES(continued) 
 
Derivative financial instruments (continued) 
 
Certain  derivatives  are  embedded  in  the  non-derivative  financial  instruments  (i.e.  host 
contracts)  and  the  embedded  derivative  and  the  corresponding  host  contract  are  collectively 
referred to as hybrid financial instruments.  An embedded derivative shall be separated from the 
host contract and accounted for as a derivative if, and only if:(i)      The  economic  characteristics  and  risks  of  the  embedded  derivative  are  not  closely 
related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract;(ii)    a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the 
definition of a derivative;(iii)    the  hybrid  (combined)  instrument  is  not  measured  at  fair  value  with  changes  in  fair 
value recognized in profit or loss.The  unrealized  gain  or  loss  arising  from  fair  value  measurement  of  separate  derivative 
instrument is reported as the “fair value gains or losses” in the income statement. 
 
Hedge accounting 
 
At the inception of each hedging relationship, the Bank documents the relationship between the 
hedging instrument and hedged item; the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge 
transaction;  and the methods used to assess the  effectiveness of the hedge. At  inception and 
on  an  on-going  basis,  the  Bank  also  documents  its  assessment  of  whether  the  hedging 
instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item.  
 
Fair value hedge 
 
Fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or 
liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or 
firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect income statement. 
 
For  a  qualifying  fair  value  hedge,  the  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hedging  derivatives  are 
recorded  in  the  income  statement,  together  with  any  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hedged 
item attributable to the hedged risk. 
 
If  the  hedge no  longer  meets  the  criteria for  hedge  accounting, the adjustment  to the  carrying 
amount  of  a  hedged  item  is  amortised  to  the  income  statement  over  its  remaining  maturity, 
using the effective interest method.  
 
Cash flow hedge 
 
The  effective  portion  of  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  hedging  instruments  that  are  designated 
and  qualify  as  cash  flow  hedges  is  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  and 
accumulated in owner’s equity. The ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income 
statement.154

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES(continued) 
 
Derivative financial instruments (continued) 
 
Hedge accounting (continued) 
 
Amounts  accumulated  in  equity  are  reclassified  to  the  income  statement  in  the  same  periods 
when the hedged item affects the income statement. 
 
When a hedging instrument expires or  is sold, or the hedge designation  is revoked or  when  a 
hedge  no  longer  meets  the  criteria  for  hedge  accounting,  any  cumulative  gain  or  loss  on  the 
hedging  instrument  existing  in  equity  at  that  time  remains  in  equity  and  is  reclassified  to  the 
profit or loss when the forecast transaction ultimately occurs. When a forecast transaction is no 
longer  expected  to  occur,  the  cumulative  gain  or  loss  existing  in  equity  is  immediately 
transferred to the profit or loss.Fixed assets 
 
Fixed assets comprise office equipment and furniture and computers. Fixed  assets purchased 
or constructed by the Bank are initially recorded at cost. 
 
Subsequent costs  are  included  in the  asset’s  carrying amount,  as  appropriate,  only  when it  is 
probable  that  future  economic  benefits  associated  with  the  item  will  flow  to  the  Bank  and  the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably.  However, the carrying amount of any  parts of fixed 
assets  that  are  being  replaced  shall  be  derecognised  and  all  related  subsequent  costs  are 
expensed when incurred.   
 
Depreciation is calculated  using the straight-line method to write down the cost of such assets 
to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. For impaired fixed assets, depreciation 
is calculated based on carrying amounts after deducting the provision for impairment over their 
estimated remaining useful lives.   
 
Estimated useful lives, estimated residual value and annual depreciation rates are as follows:Estimated useful lives  Estimated residual value 
 
 
0%-10%5-8 yearsDepreciation rate 
 
 
11.25%-20%Office equipmentand furniture 
Computers andother electronic  
 equipment2-5 years0%-10%18%-50%The  Bank  reviews  the  estimated  residual  value,  useful  lives  and  depreciation  method  of  fixed 
assets and makes appropriate adjustments on an annual basis.   
 
When the Bank disposes or ceases to use the fixed assets, or does not expect to further benefit 
from fixed assets,  the Bank derecognises the assets. Proceeds from sale, transfer or disposal 
of fixed assets are recorded in the income statement after deducting carrying value and related 
taxes. 
 
Long-term prepaid expenses 
 
Long-term  prepaid  expenses  include  leasehold  improvement  and  other  expenses  that  have 
been incurred but are attributable to current and future periods, and should be amortised over a 
period  of  more  than  one  year.  Long-term  prepaid  expenses  are  amortised  on  the  straight-line 
basis  over  the  expected  beneficial  periods  and  are  presented  at  cost  net  of  accumulated 
amortisation.16DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

KLPRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES(continued) 
 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
 
Fixed assets or other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment if there are indications of 
impairment.  If  the  carrying  value  of  such  assets  is  higher  than  the  recoverable  amount,  the 
excess  is  recognized  as  an  impairment  loss.    The  recoverable  amount  is  the  higher  of  the 
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
 
Provision  for  impairment  is  determined  on  individual  basis.  If  it  is  not  possible  to  estimate  the 
recoverable amount of the individual asset, the Bank determines the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating  unit  to  which  the  asset  belongs  (the  asset’s  cash-generating  unit).    A  cash-
generating  unit  is  the  smallest  group  of  assets  that  includes  the  asset  and  generates  cash 
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.  
 
Once  an  impairment  loss  is  recognised,  it  shall  not  be  reversed  to  the  extent  of  recovery  in 
value in subsequent periods.Interest income and expenses 
 
Interest income and expense for all interest-bearing financial instruments are recognised within 
‘interest  income’  and  ‘interest  expense’  in  the  income  statement  using  the  effective  interest 
method. 
 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a  financial asset 
or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant 
period using its effective interest rate. 
 
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or 
receipts  through  the  expected  life  of  the  financial  instrument  or,  when  appropriate,  a  shorter 
period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. 
 
When  calculating  the  effective  interest  rate,  the  Bank  estimates  cash  flows  considering  all 
contractual terms of the financial instrument (e.g., prepayment options, call options and similar 
options) but does not consider future credit losses.The  calculation  includes  all  fees  paid  or  received  between  parties  to  the  contract  that  are  an 
integral  part  of  the  effective interest  rate,  such as  transaction  costs  and all  other  premiums  or 
discounts.  If the cash flows cannot  be  estimated, the Bank shall use contractual cash flows  in 
the entire contract period. 
 
Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of 
an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the 
future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.MFee and commission income/expense 
 
Fee  and  commission  incomes  are  generally  recognized  on  the  percentage  of  completion 
method  when  the  related  service  has  been  provided.  Fees  and  commission  expenses  are 
generally recognized on an accrual basis when the related service has been received.174

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES(continued) 
 
Deferred income taxes 
 
Deferred  income  tax  is  provided  in  full,  using  the  liability  method,  on  temporary  differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial 
statements. Deferred tax assets shall be recognised for deductible losses or tax credits that can 
be  carried  forward  to subsequent  years.  The  deferred  tax  assets  and deferred  tax  liabilities  at 
the balance sheet date shall  be measured the tax rates that, according to the requirements of 
tax laws, are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.Deferred tax assets shall be recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit 
will be available against which the deductible losses and tax credits can be utilised. 
 
Deferred income tax related to fair value re-measurement of available-for-sale investments is 
credited or charged directly to equity and is subsequently recognised in the income statement 
together with the deferred gain and loss. 
 
The  Bank’s  deferred  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  netted  as  the  amounts  are 
recoverable from or due to the same tax authority. 
 
Operating leases 
 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the 
leaser  are  classified  as  operating  leases.The  Bank  entered  into  various  operating  lease 
agreements to rent its branches’ offices and facilities.  Payments made under operating  leases 
are expensed on a straight-line basis over the period of the leases. 
 
When  an  operating  lease  is  terminated  before  the  lease  period  has  expired,  any  payment 
required to be made to the lesser by way of penalty is recognized as an expense in the period 
in which termination takes place. 
 
Contingent liabilities and acceptances 
 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that  arises from past events and whose existence 
will  only  be  confirmed  by  the  occurrence  or  non-occurrence  of  one  or  more  uncertain  future 
events not wholly within the control of the Bank. It can also be a present obligation arising from 
past  events  that  is  not  recognized  because  it  is  not  probable  that  an  outflow  of  economic 
resources will be required or the amount of obligation cannot be measured reliably. 
 
A  contingent  liability  is  not  recognized  as  a  provision  but  is  disclosed  in  the  notes  to  the 
financial  statements. When  a  change  in  the  probability  of  an  outflow  occurs  so  that  outflow  is 
probable, it will then be recognized as a provision. 
 
Acceptances comprise undertakings by the Bank to pay bills of exchange drawn on customers. 
The Bank expects most acceptances to be settled simultaneously with the reimbursement from 
the  customers.  Acceptances  are  accounted  for  as  off-balance  sheet  transactions  and  are 
disclosed as contingent liabilities and commitments. 
 
Financial guarantee contracts 
 
The Bank has the following types of financial guarantee contracts: letters of credit and letters of 
guarantee.  These  financial  guarantee  contracts  provide  for  specified  payments  to  be  made  to 
reimburse the holder for losses incurred when the guaranteed parties default under the original 
or modified terms of the specified debt instruments.18DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

Financial guarantee contracts(continued) 
 
A financial guarantee is initially recognised in the financial  statements at fair value on the date 
the  guarantee  is  given.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  the  Bank’s  liability  under  each 
guarantee is measured at the higher of the initial measurement less amortisation and the best 
estimate  of  the  expenditure  required  to  settle  any  financial  obligation  arising  at  the  balance 
sheet date. 
 
The  contractual  amounts  of  financial  guarantee  contracts  are  disclosed  as  off-balance  sheet 
items in Note 47. 
 
Employee benefits 
 
Employee  benefits  mainly  include  short-term  employee  salary,  post-employment  benefits,  and 
share plan incurred in exchange for service rendered by employees or various forms of rewards 
or compensation due to severance of labour relation. 
 
Short-term employee benefits 
 
Short-term employee benefits include wages or salaries, bonus, allowances and subsidies, staff 
welfare,  medical  insurance,  work  injury  insurance,  maternity  insurance,  housing  funds,  union 
running costs and employee education costs, short-term paid absences. The employee benefits 
are  recognised  in  the  accounting  period  in  which  the  service  has  been  rendered  by  the 
employees,  and  as  costs  of  assets  or  expenses  to  whichever  the  employee  service  is 
attributable.  Employee  benefits  which  are  non-monetary  benefits  shall  be  measured  at  fair 
value. 
 
Post-employment benefits 
 
The  Bank  classifies  post-employment  benefit  plans  as  either  defined  contribution  plans  or 
defined  benefit  plans.  Defined  contribution  plans  are  post-employment  benefit  plans  under 
which the Bank pays fixed contributions into a separate fund and will have no obligation to pay 
further  contributions;  and  Defined  benefit  plans  are  post-employment  benefit  plans  other  than 
defined  contribution  plans.  During  the  reporting  period,  the  Bank  's  post-employment  benefits 
mainly  include  basic  pensions  and  unemployment  insurance,  both  of  which  belong  to  the 
defined contribution plans. 
 
The  Bank’s  employees  participate  in  the  defined  basic  pension  insurance  plan  set  up  and 
administered by  local labour and social protection authorities.  Basic pensions are provided for 
monthly  according  to  stipulated  bases  and  proportions  to  local  labour  and  social  security 
institutions. When employees retire, local  labour  and  social security  institutions  have a duty  to 
pay  the  basic  pension  insurance  to  them.  The  amounts  payable  are  recognised  as  liabilities 
based on the above provisions in the accounting period in which the service has been rendered 
by  the  employees,  and  as  costs  of  assets  or  expenses  to  whichever  the  employee  service  is 
attributable. 
 
Share Based Payment 
 
The employees of the Bank enjoy the equity-settled stock incentive plan implemented by the 
DBS Group Holding Ltd. (“DBS Group”), under which the Bank provides shares issued by DBS 
Group to all the employees for exchange of services they provided. Such shares provided are 
recognised in the Bank’s income statement according to the fair value of the equity instruments 
at the grant date and amortized over the vesting period with a corresponding adjustment to the 
payable to head office account.19DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

Provision 
 
Provisions are recognized when the Bank has a present obligation as a result of past transactions 
or  events,  and  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  an  outflow  of  economic  benefits  will  be  required  to 
settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. 
. 
Provisions are initially determined using best estimates based on historical experience, taking into 
consideration  the  risks,  uncertainties  and  discount  effect  related  to  contingencies.    Where  the 
effect  of  discounting  future  cash  flow  is  significant,  provisions  shall  be  determined  at  the 
discounted  future  cash  flows.  The  Bank  reviews  carrying  value  of  provision  on  date  of  balance 
sheet, and adjust the carrying value to indicate the best estimates.Segment Reporting 
 
The Bank identifies operating segments based on the internal organization structure, management 
requirement and internal reporting,  and then disclose segment information of reportable segment 
which is based on operating segment. 
 
An  operating  segment  is  a  component  of  the  Bank  :  (a)  that  engages  in  business  activities  from 
which  it  may  earn  revenues  and  incur  expenses  (including  revenues  and  expenses  relating  to 
transactions); b)whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Bank’s senior management 
to  make  decisions  about  resources  to  be  allocated  to  the  segment  and  assess  its  performance, 
and  (c)  for  which  discrete  financial  information,  including  the  financial  position,  the  financial 
performance  and  cash  flows,  is  available.  Two  or  more  operating  segments  may  be  aggregated 
into  a  single  operating  segment  if  the  segments  have  similar  economic  characteristics,  and  fulfil 
certain criteria.  
 
The majority of the Bank’s business activities are conducted within Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, 
Shenzhen , Suzhou and Tianjin of the PRC.  
 
Business combinationsU 
 
(1)  Business combinations involving enterprises not under common control.The  cost  of  combination  and  identifiable  net  assets  obtained  by  the  acquirer  in  a  business 
combination are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Where the cost of the combination 
exceeds  the  acquirer’s  interest  in  the  fair  value  of  the  acquiree’s  identifiable  net  assets,  the 
difference  is  recognised  as  goodwill;  where  the  cost  of  combination  is  lower  than  the  acquirer’s 
interest  in  the  fair  value  of  the  acquiree’s  identifiable  net  assets,  the  difference  is  recognised  in 
profit  or  loss  for  the  current  period.  Costs  directly  attributable  to  the  combination  are  included  in 
profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Transaction costs associated with the issue 
of  equity  or  debt  securities  for  the  business  combination  are  included  in  the  initially  recognised 
amounts of the equity or debt securities.4 
 
ST(2)  Business combinations involving enterprises under common controlThe consideration paid and net assets obtained by the absorbing party in a business combination 
are  measured  at  the  carrying  amount.  The  difference  between  the  carrying  amount  of  the  net 
assets  obtained  from  the  combination  and  the  carrying  amount  of  the  consideration  paid  for  the 
combination is treated as an adjustment to capital surplus (share premium). If the capital surplus 
(share  premium)  is  not  sufficient  to  absorb  the  difference,  the  remaining  balance  is  adjusted 
against  retained  earnings.  Costs  directly  attributable  to  the  combination  are  included  in  profit  or 
loss in the period in which they are incurred. Transaction costs associated with the issue of equity 
or debt securities for the business combination are included in the initially recognised amounts of 
the equity or debt securities.20The  Ministry  of  Finance  issued  the  revised  CAS  No.42  -  Non-Current  Assets  and  Disposal 
Groups Held for Saleand Termination of Business Operation (implement from 28 May 2017) and 
CAS No.16 - Government Grants (implement from 12 June 2017).  
  
According to ‘the Notice of Revision of Enterprise's General Financial Statement Format’ issued 
in December 2017 (Cai Kuai [2017] 30),  and 'the Interpretation of Questions about Enterprise's 
General  Financial  Statement  Format'  issued  on  12  January  2018,  the  Bank  shall  disclose  the 
account of 'asset disposal income' and the  comparative data. Given there is no asset disposal in 
2017  or  2016,  the  change  of  the  revised  CAS  No.42  is  not  applied  for  the  Bank  in  current  or 
comparative period. 
 
Besides, the Bank shall disclose 'other income' to deal with the government grants in 2017, the 
comparative  figures  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2016  do  not  need  to  be  restated.  The 
implementation of this change do not have significant impact on the Bank's financial conditions, 
operating performance or cash flows.W  Government Grants4VDBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

[English translation for reference only]PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES(continued)Changes in significant accounting policiesGovernment grants refer to the monetary or non-monetary assets obtained by the Bank from the 
government, including tax return, financial subsidy and etc. 
 
Government grants are recognised  when the grants can be received and  the  Bank can comply 
with all attached conditions. If a government grant is a monetary asset, it will be measured at the 
amount  received  or  receivable.  If  a  government  grant  is  a  non-monetary  asset,  it  will  be 
measured at its fair value. If it is unable to obtain its fair value reliably, it will be measured at its 
nominal amount. 
 
Government grants related to assets refer to government grants which are obtained by the Bank 
for  the  purposes  of  purchase,  construction  or  acquisition  of  the  long-term  assets.  Government 
grants related to income refer to the government grants other than those related to assets. 
 
Government  grants  related  to  assets  are  either  deducted  against  the  carrying  amount  of  the 
assets, or recorded as deferred income and recognised in profit or loss on a systemic basis over 
the useful lives of the assets. Government grants related to income  that compensate the future 
costs, expenses or losses  are recorded as  deferred  income and recognised in profit or  loss, or 
deducted  against  related  costs,  expenses  or  losses  in  reporting  the  related  expenses; 
government  grants  related  to  income  that  compensate  the  incurred  costs,  expenses  or  losses 
are recognised in profit or loss, or deuducted against related costs, expenses or losses directly in 
current period. The Bank applies the presentation method consistently to the similar government 
grants in the financial statements. 
 
Government  grants  that  are  related  to  ordinary  activities  are  included  in  operating  profit, 
otherwise, they are recorded in non-operating income or expenses.For  the  policy  loans  with  favourable  interest  rates,  the  Bank  records  the  loans  at  the  actual 
amounts  and  calculates  the  interests  by  loan  principals  and  the  favourable  interest  rates.  The 
interest  subsidies  directly  received  from  government  are  recorded  as  a  reduction  of  interest 
expenses.21DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

POLICIES 
 
The  Bank  makes  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and 
liabilities in the financial statements.  Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and  are 
based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are 
believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  Areas  susceptible  to  changes  in  essential 
estimates  and  judgments,  which  affect  the  carrying  value  of  assets  and  liabilities,  are  set  out 
below.  It  is  impracticable  to  determine  the  effect  of  changes  to  either  the  key  assumptions 
discussed  below  or  other  estimation  uncertainties.  It  is  possible  that  actual  results  may  require 
material adjustments to the estimates referred to below. 
 
Allowance for impairment losses on loans and advances 
 
The  Bank  reviews  its  loan  portfolios  to assess  impairment  except  that  there  are  known situation 
demonstrates  impairment  losses  have  occurred  on  a  regular  basis.  In  determining  whether  an 
impairment loss should be recorded in the income statement, the Bank makes judgements as to 
whether  there  is  any  observable  data  indicating  that  there  is  a  measurable  decrease  in  the 
estimated future cash flows from a portfolio of loans before the decrease can be identified with an 
individual  loan  in  that  portfolio.  This  evidence  may  include  observable  data  indicating  that  there 
has  been  an  adverse  change  in  the  payment  status  of  borrowers  in  a  group  (e.g.  payment 
delinquency  or  default),  or  national  or  local  economic  conditions  that  correlate  with  defaults  on 
assets in the group.  Management uses estimates based on historical loss  experience for assets 
with credit risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio 
when  scheduling  its  future  cash  flows.  The  methodology  and  assumptions  used  for  estimating 
both the amount and timing of future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences 
between loss estimates and actual loss experienc.Fair value of financial instruments 
 
The fair value of financial instruments that is not quoted in active markets is determined by using 
valuation  techniques.  The  valuation  models  (like  cash  flow  discount  model)  are  periodically 
evaluated and validated by the specialists with professional qualifications, who are independent of 
the designers of the models. To the extent practical, cash flow models use only observable data, 
however,  areas  such  as  credit  risk  (both  own  and  counterparty),  volatilities  and  correlations 
require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect 
reported fair value of financial instruments. 
 
Income tax 
 
Significant  estimates  are  required  in  determining the  provision for  income tax.  There  are  certain 
transactions  and  calculations  for  which  the  ultimate  tax  determination  is  uncertain  during  the 
ordinary course of business. The Bank recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based 
on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. In particular, the deductibility of certain items 
in the  PRC  is  subject  to tax  authority’s  approval,  mainly  like the  impairment  allowance for  loans 
and  advances. Where  the  final  tax  outcome  of  these  matters  is  different  from  the  amounts  that 
were  initially  recorded,  such  differences  will  impact  the  income  tax  and  deferred  income  tax 
provisions in the period in which such determination is made.6  AUTHORIZATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe financial statements were authorized for issue by Board of Directors on 31 January 2018.2278DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

including unsettled spot transactions.24DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

[English translation for reference only]DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING(continued)12 
 
12.1  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS(continued)Foreign exchange and interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows 
for another.  Swaps result in an economic exchange of currencies or interest rates (for example, 
fixed rate for floating rate) or a combination of all these (i.e. cross-currency interest rate swaps).  
The  Bank’s  credit  risk  represents  the  potential  cost  to  replace  the  swap  contracts  if 
counterparties  fail  to  perform  their  obligation.  This  risk  is  monitored  on  an  ongoing  basis  with 
reference to the current  fair  value,  the  notional  amount  of  the  contracts  and  the  liquidity  of  the 
market.  To  control  the  level  of  credit  risk  taken,  the  Bank  assesses  counterparties  using  the 
same techniques as for its lending activities. 
 
Foreign currency  options  are contractual  agreements  under  which  the  seller  (writer)  grants  the 
purchaser  (holder)  the  right,  but  not  the  obligation,  either  to  buy  (a  call  option)  or  sell  (a  put 
option)  at  or  by  a set  date  or  during  a set  period,  a  specific  amount of  a foreign currency  or  a 
financial instrument at a predetermined price. The seller receives a premium from the purchaser 
in consideration for the assumption of foreign exchange risk. Options may be either exchange-
traded or negotiated between the Bank and a customer (OTC). 
 
Interest rate options is a right obtained by the buyer, after payment of a premium, to buy or sell 
certain  interest  rate  instrument  at  certain  interest  rate  (price)  within  its  validity  period  or  after 
expiration.   
 
Equity  options  provide  the  buyer,  on  payment  of  a  premium,  the  right  but  not  the  obligation, 
either  to  purchase  or  sell  a  specified  stock  or  stock  index  at  a  specified  price  or  level  on  or 
before a specified date. 
 
Equity  swaps  involve  the  exchange  of  a  set  of  payments  whereby  one  of  these  payments  is 
based on an equity-linked return while the other is typically based on an interest reference rate.Commodity  contracts  are  agreements  between  two  parties  to  exchange  cash  flows  which  are 
dependent on the price of the underlying physical assets. 
 
Total  Return  Swap  is  a  bilateral  financial  transaction  where  the  counterparties  swap  the  total 
return of a single asset or basket of assets in exchange for periodic cash flows. 
 
The  notional  amounts  of  certain  types  of  financial  instruments  provide  a  basis  for  comparison 
with instruments recognised on the balance sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of 
future  cash  flows  involved  or  the  current  fair  value  of  the  instruments  and,  therefore,  do  not 
indicate  the  Bank’s  exposure  to  credit  or  market  risks.    The  derivative  instruments  become 
favourable (assets) or unfavourable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates 
or foreign exchange rates relative to their terms. The aggregate fair values of derivative financial 
assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from time to time.The fair value of financial instruments that is not quoted in active markets is determined by using 
valuation  techniques.    To  the  extent  practical,  cash  flow  models  use  only  observable  data,  like 
interest  rate  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rate,  certain  data  like  credit  risk  (both  own  and 
counterparty),  volatilities  and  correlations  require  management  to  make  estimates.  Changes  in 
assumptions about these factors could affect reported fair value of financial instruments.

The  Bank’s  cash  flow  hedges  consist  principally  of  currency  swaps  transacted  to  hedge  highly 
probable  forecast  transactions  expected  to  occur  at  various  future  dates  against  variability  in 
exchange  rates.    The  currency  swaps  have  maturity  dates  that  coincide  within  the  expected 
occurrence of these transactions. 
 
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the Bank’s net gain from the cash flow hedge of RMB 6.39  
million  (for  the  year  ended  31  December  2016:  5.02  million)  were  recognized  in  other

was immaterial for the year ended 31 December 2017. There were no transactions for which cash 
flow hedge accounting had to be ceased for the year ended 31 December 2017, as a result of the 
highly probable cash flows no longer being expected to occur.

Pursuant to Circular Caijin No.49 issued by MOF in 2005, banks and certain other financial institutions 
in  the  PRC,  are  required  to  maintain  adequate  allowances  for  impairment  losses  against  their  risk 
assets. In addition, a general risk reserve should be established through the appropriation of retained 
earnings. This general risk reserve should form part of the owner’s equity of financial institutions. As a 
guiding  principle,  the  balance  of  general  risk  reserve  should  not  be  less  than  1%  of  the  aggregate 
amount  of  all  risk  assets.  On  17  April  2012,  MOF  issued  Circular  Caijin  No.20,  which  supersedes 
Circular  Caijin  No.49  and  raises  the  minimum  level  of  general  risk  reserve  to  1.5%  of  aggregated 
amount of all risk assets, which should be fulfilled in the next five years since July 2012. 
 
On  7  February  2017,  the  directors  approved  the  appropriation  to  the  Bank’s  general  risk  reserve 
amounting to RMB 6 million in accordance with Circular Caijin No.20 issued in 2012. The general risk 
reserve after this appropriation amounts to RMB 996.8 million.393536DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

As  at  31  December  2017,  the  Bank  has  no  significant  capital  commitments  which  require  separate 
disclosure (31 December 2016: nil).48SUBSEQUENT EVENTSOn  31  January  2018,  the  directors  approved  the  appropriation  to  the  Bank's  general  risk  reserve

(Presentation  of  Financial  Instruments),  requiring  non-listed  companies  to  apply  new  CAS  from  1 
January  2021,  and  early  implementation  is  encouraged.  The  Bank  has  decided  to  early  adoption  of 
the above accounting standards from 1 January 2018.

comparable  figures  but  the  opening  balance  of  retained  earnings  or  other  comprehensive  income 
need  retrospective  adjustment.  Therefore,  from  2018,  the  Bank  will  disclose  the  accounting 
statements according to the new CAS. The Bank does not need to restate the comparable figures for 
2017 but only need to adjust the retained earnings and other comprehensive income of the beginning

2  years  after grant;  another 33%  will  vest on the third  year  and the remaining 34% plus 
the retention award will vest 4 years after grant.  The  market  price  of  shares  on  the  grant  date  is  used  to  estimate  the  fair  value  of  theshares awarded.  Vested and unvested shares are subject to clawback/malus.

[English translation for reference only]FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT53 
 
53.1  Risk governanceThe  Board  oversees  the  Bank’s  affairs  and  provides  sound  leadership  for  the  CEO  and 
management.  Authorised  by  the  Board,  various  Board  committees  oversee  specific 
responsibilities based on clearly defined terms of reference. 
 
Under  the  Bank’s  risk  governance  frameworks,  the  Board,  through  the  Board  Risk 
Management  Committee  (‘China  BRMC’),  sets  the  Bank’s  risk  appetite,  oversees  the 
establishment  of    enterprise-wide  risk  management  policies  and  processes,  and  sets  risk 
limits to guide risk-taking within the Bank. 
 
The BRMC oversees the identification, monitoring, management and reporting of credit, 
market, liquidity, operational and reputational risks. To facilitate the BRMC’s risk oversight, 
the following risk management committees have been established: 
 
1.  Risk Executive Committee (Risk ExCo); 
2.  China Credit Risk Committee (CCRC);  
3.  China Market and Liquidity Risk Committee (CMLRC); and 
4.  China Operational Risk Committee (CORC). 
 
As the overall executive body regarding risk matters, the Risk ExCo oversees the Bank’s 
risk management as a whole. 
 
Each of the committees reports to the Risk Exco, and the committees as a whole serve as 
an executive forum to discuss and implement the Bank’s risk management: 
 
Key responsibilities:  Assess and approve risk-taking activities;  
  Oversee  the  Bank’s  risk  management  infrastructure,  which  includes  frameworks, 
decision  criteria,  authorities,  people,  policies,  standards,  processes,  information 
and systems;  Approve risk policies; 
  Assess and monitor specific credit concentration; and 
Recommend scenarios and the resulting macroeconomic variable projections used 
for enterprise-wide stress tests.The members in these committees comprise representatives from the Risk Management 
Group (RMG) as well as key business and support units. 
 
The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) oversees the risk management function. The CRO is 
independent of business lines and is actively involved in key decision-making processes. 
He often engages with regulators to discuss risk matters, enabling a more holistic risk 
management perspective. 
 
Working closely with the risk and business committees, the CRO is responsible for the 
following:  Management  of  the  Bank’s  risks,  including  systems  and  processes  to  identify,approve, measure, monitor, control and report risks;  Engagement  with  senior  management  about  material  matters  regarding  all  risktypes;56DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)53 
 
53.1  Risk governance(continued)  Development of risk controls and mitigation processes; and 
  Ensuring  the  Bank’s  risk  management  is  effective  and  the  Risk  Appetiteestablished by the Board is adhered to.53.2  Credit riskAB(i)The most significant measurable risk DBS China faces is Credit risk which arises from the 
Bank’s  daily  activities  in  various  businesses.  These  activities  include  lending  to  retail, 
corporate and institutional customers; it includes both the risk of lending as well as the pre-
settlement  and  settlement  risk  of  foreign  exchange,  derivatives  and  debt  securities;  and 
settlement of transactions. 
 
Credit Risk Management 
 
The Bank’s approach to credit risk management comprises the following building blocks:Policies 
 
The  Bank  localized  Group  Core  Credit  Risk  Policy,  by  taking  account  of  the  local  laws, 
regulations.    The  Core  Credit  Risk  Policy  provides  the  foundation  upon  which  the  Bank 
conducts our credit risk management and control activities. This policy supplemented by a 
number  of  operational  policies  and  standards,  ensures  consistency  in  identifying, 
assessing, underwriting, measuring, reporting and controlling credit risk across the Bank. 
 
The operational policies and standards are established to provide greater details about the 
implementation of credit principles within the Group and localized CCRP, and are adapted 
to reflect different credit environments and portfolio risk profiles.Risk Methodologies 
 
Credit risk is managed by thoroughly understanding the Bank’s customers – the businesses 
they are in, as well as the economies in which they operate.  
 
Loans and advances and off balance sheet exposures 
 
The Bank uses internal rating system adopted by the group to identify, out of the 11 broad 
ratings in the system, the risk rating of the corporate borrowers. At the same time, the Bank 
also assigns loan grade to each facility for both corporate and retail borrowers under a five 
grade  asset  classification  system  to  manage  the  quality  of  its  loan  portfolio.  Such 
classification  system  is  based  on  “the  Guidance  on  Credit  Risk  Classification”  (”the 
Guidance”) issued by CBRC. Under the Bank’s own system and the CBRC Guidance, the 
Bank classifies its credit assets and off-balance sheet credit exposures into five categories, 
which  are  namely  pass,  special  mention,  substandard,  doubtful  and  loss.  The  last  three 
categories are also classified as “non-performing credit assets”. 
 
The core definition of the Bank’s credit asset classification is as follows: 
 
Pass: The borrower is able to fulfil  the contractual  obligations, and  there is no uncertaintythat principal and interest can be paid on time.57DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

Special Mention: The borrower is able to make current due payments, but there exist some 
indications  that  may  have  negative  impact  on  the  borrower’s  future 
payments.(ii)(iii)(iv)Substandard:  The  borrower's  repayment  ability  has  been  in  doubt  and  its  normal  income 
cannot  repay  the  loan  principal  and  interest  in  full.  Losses  may  be 
incurred  by  the  Bank,  even  with  the  enforcement  of  guarantees  and 
collateral.Doubtful: The borrower cannot repay the principal and the interest in full. Significant losseswill be incurred even with the enforcements of guarantees and collateral.Loss:  After  taking  into  consideration  all  possible  recovery  actions  and  necessary  legal 
procedures,  the  principal  and  interest  cannot  be  collected  or  only  a  very 
small portion of principal and interest can be collected.Traded products and securities 
 
Counterparty risk that may arise from traded products and securities is viewed similarly to 
loan  exposures  and  included  under  the  Bank’s  overall  lending  limits  to  counterparties. 
Issuer  Default  Risk  that  may  arise  from  traded  products  and  securities  are  generally 
measured and monitored via limits set by the Bank. 
 
Loans to other banks and financial institutions 
 
The Bank reviews and monitors the credit risk of individual financial institutions on regular 
basis. Limits are placed for each individual bank or non-banking financial institution which 
has business relationship with the Bank.Pre-settlement credit risk 
 
Pre-settlement  credit  risk  for  traded  products  arising  from  a  counterparty’s  potentially 
defaulting  on  its  obligations  is  quantified  by  evaluation  of  the  market  price,  plus  potential 
future exposure. 
 
The Bank actively monitors and manages its exposure to counterparties in over-the-counter 
(OTC)  derivative  trades  to  protect  its  balance  sheet  in  the  event  of  counterparty  default. 
Counterparty  risk  exposures  that  may  be  adversely  affected  by  market  risk  events  are 
identified,  reviewed  and  acted  upon  by  management,  and  highlighted  to  the  appropriate 
risk  committees.  Specific  wrong-way  risk  arises  when  the  exposure  to  a  particular 
counterparty directly  correlates with the probability of defaulting due to guide the handling 
of  specific  wrong-way  risk  transactions,  and  its  risk  mearsurement  metric  takes  into 
account the higher risks associated with such transactions.  
 
Issuer default risk that may also arise from derivatives, notes and securities are  generally 
measured based on jump-to-default computations.58DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)53 
 
53.2  Credit risk (continued) 
 
CDProcess, System and Reports 
 
The  Bank  constantly  invest  in  systems  to  support  risk  monitoring  and  reporting  for  its 
Institutional Banking and Consumer Banking Management businesses.  
 
The end-to-end credit process is constantly being reviewed and improved through various 
front-to-back initiatives involving the business units, the operations unit, the RMG and other 
key stakeholders. Day-to-day monitoring of credit exposures, portfolio performance and the 
external  environment  factors  potentially  affecting  credit  risk  profiles  is  key  to  the  Bank's 
philosophy of effective credit risk management.  
 
In  addition,  risk  reporting  on  credit  trends,  which  may  include  industry  analysis,  early 
warning  alerts  and significant  weak  credits,  is  submitted  to the  various  credit  committees, 
allowing  key  strategies  and  action  plans  to  be  formulated  and  evaluated.  Credit  control 
functions  also  ensure  that  any  credit  risks  taken  complies  with  group-wide  credit  policies 
and guidelines. These functions ensure that approved limits are activated, credit excesses 
and  policy  exceptions  are  appropriately  endorsed,  compliance  with  credit  standards  is 
carried out, and covenants established by management and regulators are informed. 
 
Collateral received 
 
Where  possible,  the  Bank  takes  collateral  as  a  secondary  recourse  to  the  borrower.  This 
includes,  but  not  limited  to  cash,  marketable  securities,  real  estate,  trade  receivables, 
inventory and equipment and other physical and financial collateral. We may also take fixed 
and floating charges on the assets of borrowers.  
 
Policies  have  been  put  in  place  to  determine  the  eligibility  of  collateral  for  credit  risk 
mitigation.  These  include  requiring  specific  collaterals  to  meet  minimum  operational 
requirements in order to be considered as effective risk mitigants. The Bank’s collateral is 
generally  diversified  and  periodic  valuations  of  collateral  are  required.  Real  Estate 
constitute the bulk of our collateral, while marketable securities and cash are immaterial. 
 
For  derivatives,  repurchase  agreements  (repo)  and  other  repo-style  transactions  with 
financial  market  counterparties,  collateral  arrangements  are  typically  covered  under 
market-standard  documentation,  such  as    International  Swaps  &  Derivatives  Association 
(ISDA) Agreements/ National Association Financia lMarket Institutional Investors (NAFMII) 
Agreements and Master Repurchase Agreements. The collateral received is mark-to-market 
on  a  frequency  which  the  Group  and  the  counterparties  mutually  agreed  upon  and  is 
governed by internal guidelines with respect to collateral eligibility. In the event of a default, 
the  credit  risk  exposure  is  reduced  by  master-netting  arrangements  where  the  Group  is 
allowed to offset what it owes a counterparty against what is due from that counterparty in 
a netting-eligible jurisdiction.  
 
Collateral held against derivatives generally consists of cash in major currencies and highly 
rated  government  or  quasi-government  bonds.  Exceptions  may  arise  in  certain  countries, 
where  due  to  domestic  capital  markets  and  business  conditions,  the  Group  may  be 
required  to  accept  less  highly  rated  or  liquid  government  bonds  and  currencies.  Reverse 
repo-transactions  are  generally  limited  to  large  institutions  with  reasonably  good  credit 
standing.  The  Group takes  haircuts  against  the underlying  collateral  of  these transactions 
that commensurate with collateral quality to ensure credit risks are adequately mitigated.59DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

In  times  of  difficulty,  the  Group  will  review  the  customer’s  specific  situation  and 
circumstances  to  assist  them  in  restructuring  their  repayment  liabilities.  However,  should 
the need arise, disposal and recovery processes are in place to dispose of collateral held 
by  the  Group.  The  Group  also  maintains  a  panel  of  agents  and  solicitors  that  helps  it  to 
dispose of non-liquid assets and specialised equipment quickly.

[English translation for reference only]FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)5353.3  Market riskMarket  Risk  is  a  risk  arising  from  adverse  changes  in  interest  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates, 
equity  prices,  credit  spreads  and  commodity  prices,  as  well  as  related  factors.  The  Bank’s 
exposure to market risk is categorized into:  Trading portfolios: Arising from positions taken for (i) market-making, (ii) client-facilitationAand (iii) benefiting from market opportunities.  Banking  portfolios:  Arising  from  (i)  positions  taken  to  manage  the  interest  rate  risk  of 
Institutional  Banking  and  Consumer  Banking  assets  and  liabilities;  (ii)  structural  foreign 
exchange risk arising mainly from the Bank’s USD capital; and (iii) accrual interest which 
is denominated in currencies other than RMB.Market Risk Management  
 
China  BRMC  establishes  the  Bank’s  risk  appetite  and  framework  for  market  risk  and  China 
MLRC  serves  as  the  executive  forum  for  overseeing  various  aspects  of  market  risk  taking 
including  limit  management,  policies,  processes,  methodologies  and  systems,  and  report  to 
China Risk Exco. 
 
The Bank’s approach to market risk management is formulated on the following building blocks: 
 
Policies 
 
The Market Risk Management Policy sets the overall approach towards market risk management, 
while  the  Market  Risk  Management  Standard  establishes  the  base  requirements  for  the  said 
management  within  the  Bank.  The  Market  Risk  Management  Guide  complements  the  Market 
Risk  Management  Standard  by  providing  more  details  regarding  specific  subject  matters.  Both 
the  Market  Risk  Management  Standard  and  Market  Risk  Management  Guide  facilitate  the 
identification,  measurement,  control,  monitoring  and  reporting  of  market  risk  in  a  consistent 
manner.  They  also  set  out  the  overall  approach,  standards  and  controls  governing  market  risk 
stress  testing  across  the  Bank.  The  criteria  for  determining  the  positions  to  be  included  in  the 
trading book are stipulated in the Trading Book Policy Statement.64DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)5353.3  Market risk (continued)A  Market Risk Management (continued)Risk Methodologies 
 
Value-at-Risk (VaR) is a method that computes the potential losses on risk positions as a result 
of market movements over a specified time horizon and according to a given level of confidence. 
The Bank’s VaR model is based on historical simulation with a one-day holding period. The Bank 
uses  Expected  Shortfall  (ES),  which  is  the  average  of  potential  loss  beyond  a  given  level  of 
confidence,  to  monitor  and  limit  market  risk  exposures.  ES  is  supplemented  by  risk  control 
metrics such as sensitivities to risk factors and loss triggers for management action. 
 
The  Bank  conducts  back-testing  to  verify  the  predictiveness  of  the  VaR  model.  Back-testing 
compares VaR calculated for positions at the close of each business day with the Profit and Loss 
(P&L) that actually arises in those positions on the following business day. The back-testing P&L 
excludes fees and commissions, and revenues from intra-day trading.  
 
For back-testing, VaR at the 99% level of confidence and over a one-day holding period is used. 
The  Bank  adopts  the  standardised  approach  to  compute  market  risk  regulatory  capital  for  the 
trading book positions. As such, VaR back-testing does not impact the Bank’s regulatory capital 
for market risk. 
 
VaR models allow the Bank to estimate the aggregate portfolio market risk potential loss due to a 
range of market risk factors and instruments. However, there are limitations to VaR models. For 
example,  past  changes  in  market  risk  factors  may  not  provide  accurate  predictions  of  future 
market movements, and the risk arising from adverse market events may be understated.To  monitor  the  Bank’s  vulnerability  to  unexpected  but  plausible  extreme  market  risk-related 
events,  the  Bank  conducts  multiple  market  risk  stress  tests  regularly.  These  cover  trading  and 
non-trading portfolios and follow a combination of historical and hypothetical scenarios depicting 
risk-factor movement. 
 
ES and Net Interest Income (NII) Variability are the key risk metrics used to manage the Bank’s 
assets  and  liabilities.  As  an  exception,  credit  spread  risk  arising  from  loans  and  receivables  is 
managed  under  the  credit  risk  management  framework.  The  Bank  also  manages  banking  book 
interest  rate  risk  arising  from  mismatches  in  the  interest  rate  profiles  of  assets,  liabilities  and 
capital  instruments  (and  associated  hedges),  which  includes  basis  risk  arising  from  different 
interest rate benchmarks, interest rate re-pricing risk, yield curve risks and embedded optionality. 
The Bank measures interest rate risk in the banking book on a weekly basis. 
 
Processes, Systems and Reports 
 
Robust internal control processes and systems have been designed and implemented to support 
the  Bank’s  market  risk  management  approach.  The  Bank  reviews  these  control  processes 
regularly, and these reviews allow senior management to assess their effectiveness. 
 
The RMG Market and Liquidity Risk unit – an independent market risk management function 
reporting to CRO – monitors, controls and analyses the Bank’s market risk daily.65DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

53.4  Liquidity riskAThe  Bank’s  liquidity  risk  arises  from  its  obligations  to  honour  withdrawals  of  deposits,  repayments  of 
borrowed funds at maturity, and the commitments to its customers to extend  loans to the customers. 
The  Bank  seeks  to  manage  its  liquidity  in  a  manner  that  ensures  that  its  liquidity  obligations  will 
continue to be honoured under normal as well as adverse circumstances. 
 
Liquidity Risk Management 
 
China MLRC is the primary party responsible for liquidity risk management based on the Liquidity Risk 
Management Policy approved by China BRMC, and reports to China Risk Exco. 
 
The  Bank’s  Assets  and Liabilities  Committee regularly  reviews  balance sheet  composition,  growth in 
loans  and  deposits,  utilisation  of  wholesale  funding,  momentum  in  business  activities,  market 
competition,  economic  outlook,  market  conditions  and  other  factors  that  may  affect  liquidity  in  the 
continual refinement of the Bank’s funding strategy. 
 
The Bank’s approach to liquidity risk management comprises the following building blocks: 
 
Policies 
 
The  Liquidity  Risk  Management  Policy  sets  out  the  Bank’s  overall  approach  towards  liquidity  risk 
management and describes the range  of strategies employs to manage its liquidity. These strategies 
include  maintaining  an  adequate  counterbalancing  capacity  to  address  potential  cashflow  shortfalls 
and having diversified sources of liquidity.  
 
The  Bank’s  counterbalancing  capacity  includes  liquid  assets,  the  capacity  to  borrow  from  the  money 
markets (including the issuance of Negotiable Certificate of Deposit (NCD)), and forms of managerial 
interventions that improve liquidity. In the event of a potential or actual crisis,  the Bank has in place a 
set of liquidity contingency and recovery plans to ensure that the Bank maintains adequate liquidity. 
 
The  Liquidity  Risk  Management  Policy  is  supported  by  Standards  that  establish  the  detailed 
requirements  for  liquidity  risk  identification,  measurement, reporting  and control  within the  Bank.  The 
set  of  Policies  and  Standards  communicate  these  baseline  requirements  to  ensure  consistent 
application throughout the Bank.68DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

ALiquidity Risk Management (continued) 
 
Risk Methodologies 
 
The  primary  measure  used  to  manage  liquidity  within  the  tolerance  defined  by  China  BRMC  is  cash 
flow  maturity  mismatch analysis.  This  form  of  analysis  is  performed  on  a regular  basis  under  normal 
and adverse scenarios. It assesses the adequacy of the Bank’s counterbalancing capacity  to fund or 
mitigate  any  cash  flow  shortfalls  that  may  occur  as  forecasted  in  the  cash  flow  movements  across 
successive  time  bands.  To  ensure  that  liquidity  is  managed  in  line  with  the  Risk  Appetite,  core 
parameters such as the types of scenarios, the survival period and the minimum level of liquid assets, 
are  pre-specified  for  monitoring  and  control  on  a  bank-wide  basis.  Any  occurrences  of  forecasted 
shortfalls  that  cannot  be  covered  by  the  counterbalancing  capacity  will  be  escalated  to  the  relevant 
committees for evaluation and action. 
 
Liquidity  risk  stress  testing  is  performed  regularly  using  cashflow  maturity  mismatch  analysis,  and 
covers  adverse  scenarios  involving  shocks  that  are  general  market  and/or  name-specific  in  nature. 
Stress  tests  assess  the  Bank’s  vulnerability  when  liability  run-offs  increase,  asset  rollovers  increase 
and/or  liquid  asset  buffers  decrease.  In  addition,  ad  hoc  stress  tests  are  performed  as  part  of  the 
Bank’s ICAAP exercises.  
 
Liquidity  risk  control  measures,  such  as  liquidity-related  ratios  and  balance  sheet  analysis,  are 
complementary  tools  for  cashflow  maturity  mismatch  analysis,  and  they  are  performed  regularly  to 
obtain  deeper  insights  and  finer  control  over  the  Bank’s  liquidity  profile.  The  liquidity  risk  control 
measures  also  include  concentration  measures  regarding  top  depositors,  wholesale  borrowing  and 
swapped funds. 
 
Processes, Systems and Reports 
 
Robust  internal  control  processes  and  systems  support  the  Bank’s  overall  approach  in  identifying, 
measuring, aggregating, controlling and monitoring liquidity risk in the Bank.  
 
The RMG Market and Liquidity Risk unit – an independent liquidity risk management function reporting 
to CRO – manages the day-to-day liquidity risk monitoring, control reporting and analysis.   
 
Liquidity Risk in 2017 
 
 
The  Bank  actively  monitors  and  manages  the  liquidity  profile  through  cash  flow  maturity  mismatch 
analysis. In forecasting cash flow under the analysis, behavioural profiling is necessary in cases where 
a  product  has  indeterminate  maturity  or  the  contractual  maturity  does  not  realistically  reflect  the 
expected cash flow.B69Non-derivative cash flows of financial assets and liabilities

valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained 
from  independent  sources;  unobservable  inputs  reflect  the  Bank’s  market  assumptions.  These  two 
types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: 
 
• Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.• Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices). This level includes 
the  majority  of  the  OTC  derivative contracts  and RMB  debt  instruments  traded  in  inter-bank market. 
The sources of input parameters like LIBOR yield curve or counterparty credit risk are Bloomberg and 
China Bond. 
 
• Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs). This level includes structured financial instruments.This  hierarchy  requires  the  use  of  observable  market  data  when  available.  The  Bank  considers 
relevant and observable market prices in its valuations where possible.74DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED

[English translation for reference only]53  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)53.5  Fair value hierarchy(continued)(b)   Assets and liabilities not measured at fair value but disclose their fair valueFair values estimation is made in accordance with information of market and financial instruments in some 
 specific point. Estimation is based on following methods and supposition: 
 
 
Cash  and  due  from  other  banks  and  financial  institutions,  Deposits  with  the  central  bank,  Deposits  with 
other  banks,Due  to  other  banks  and  financial  institutions,  Interest  receivable,  Interest  payable,  Other 
assets and Other liabilities. 
 
Given  that  maturities  of  these  financial  assets  and  liabilities  are  either  short-term  or  re-priced  more  than 
once every year; the carrying amount approximates the fair value, belonging to level 2. 
 
Loans and advances 
 
Because  the  RMB  loan  interest  rates  follows  the  movement  of  PBOC  benchmark  interest  rates,  and 
interest tares for loans denominated in foreign exchange are generally floating rates, fair value of loans is 
close to carrying value.  
 
Customer deposits  
 
The  fair  value  of  current,  savings  and  money  market accounts  is  the  amount  payable  on  demand  at the 
reporting date.  The carrying  value  of fixed interest-bearing deposits and placements  approximates to its 
fair value because they are mainly payable in short term period. 
 
The  Bank  takes  the  date  on  which  events  causing  the  transfers  between  the  levels  take  place  as  the 
timing specific for recognising the transfers. There are no significant transfers in or out regarding to assets 
or  liabilities  measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  and  categorised  within  Level  3.  There  is  no 
transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 for current year.76DBS BANK (CHINA) LIMITED
