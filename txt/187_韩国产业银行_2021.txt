234  Global NetworkAs an advanced policy finance institution, KDB has provided 
momentum to accelerate the sustainable growth of the 
Korean economy and the country’s financial services system.Going forward, KDB will maintain its commitment at the 
forefront of Korea’s economy to inspire Korea with innovative 
financial practices and create a sustainable financial 
environment for generations ahead.Message from the Chairman and CEOLee, Dong Gull
Chairman & CEO
Korea Development Bank004005As for companies and industries that have lost their competitive 
advantage, KDB will work towards restoring the value of their core 
activity and asset by encouraging fundamental reorientation of their 
businesses.Fourth, KDB will actively support digital transition of the Korean 
economy, while also developing digital capabilities of its own.Social distancing triggered by the pandemic has accelerated digital 
transformation throughout society and business. Recognizing this 
irreversible trend, KDB will focus its financing on digital companies 
and sectors that will lead the future of the Korean economy. This will 
go hand in hand with an effort to enhance KDB’s own institutional 
capacity by expediting the digitization of the Bank’s corporate 
banking procedures.More specifically, the Bank will leverage the success of its Data-
Backed Loan Program launched in December 2020 to discover more 
data-driven innovators that have yet to secure the necessary assets 
to be eligible for a bank loan. KDB will also strengthen the growth of 
data-based industries in Korea by financing data center projects and 
offering targeted initiatives.As for its own digital capacity, the Bank plans to digitize its entire 
corporate banking procedures through developing AI platforms 
and adopting automated credit review processes. This will be 
accompanied by an effort to continually pursue greater efficiency 
of the Bank’s workforce by utilizing robotic process automation for 
repetitive and routine works as well as capacity training courses to 
encourage and cultivate a digital mindset across the workplace.Dear Clients and Partners,Korea is undergoing an important transition on many of its fronts 
and this is leading to a growing list of policy financing needs. Meeting 
these needs at this crucial juncture requires a new way of doing 
finance. Hence, KDB will seek to pioneer a new path of policy finance 
for the present and for the future of Korea. The Bank is fully aware 
of the challenges and obstacles it will face along the way that will be 
too great if it were to tackle them alone. So I ask for your continued 
support and encouragement that will allow the Bank to stay the 
course of innovation and change.Thank you.Management ProfilesChairman & CEOExecutive Directors006007Lee, Jun Sung

industrial revolution ahead.In particular, to help companies reach their net zero goals, 
a key theme worldwide, the Bank will develop systematic 
financial support to help establish, operate and enable the 
expansion of green supply chains across all industrial sectors.Corporate RestructuringSince the Asian financial crisis of 1997, KDB has become the 
unrivaled leader in Korea for investment banking and corporate 
restructuring. The global financial crisis of 2008 has resulted 
in a prolonged plateau in the global economic growth curve, 
as well as a jump in both the number and size of distressed 
businesses requiring turnaround. In light of these challenges, 
the Bank has set an example for principled and efficient 
corporate turnarounds, serving as a safety net to the national 
economy and the country’s businesses.REVIEW OF 2021KDB has made every effort as a policy finance institution 
to facilitate efficient turnaround of distressed businesses. 
The Bank focused on the insolvencies of large corporate 
enterprises that can potentially have massive impact on the 
national economy and in doing so played an active role as a 
safety net and growth facilitator for Korean businesses.Amidst a prolonged global recession and resulting challenges 
to Korea’s shipbuilding and shipping industries, KDB has 
introduced targeted turnaround measures to the country’s 
yards and shippers facing financial difficulties. As a result, 
HMM posted record results in 2021 following KDB investments 
and radical management overhaul, while Hanjin HeavyCapital MarketsDebt Capital Markets
REVIEW OF 2021Against resurging waves of Covid19, KDB extended and 
expanded its capital markets stabilization programs introduced

bond market.Furthermore, the Bank bolstered the growth of the ESG bond 
market by arranging, underwriting, and investing in a greater 
volume of ESG bonds in 2021. For the first time in Korea, the 
Bank issued three primary collateralized bond obligations 
(P-CBOs) backed by privately placed ESG bonds issued by SMEs 
and MEs. These P-CBO transactions marked a milestone in 
an ESG bond market dominated by public offerings from large 
and public companies, extending the reach to SMEs/MEs and 
private placements.026027With respect to international bonds, KDB successfully arranged 
the Korean government’s Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund 
Bond issuance and other global offerings by issuers like Korea 
Gas Corporation and LG Chem. The Bank made its first entry 
into the top 10 arrangers in Bloomberg’s official league table, 
consolidating its position as a leading Korean investment bank. 
The Bank’s also broadened its investment banking activities by 
providing rating advisory to Korea Ocean Business Corporation 
for obtaining its inaugural international credit ratings and 
liability management to support the restructuring process of 
Doosan Group.PLANS FOR 2022In 2022, KDB plans to provide a greater spectrum of financial 
solutions to its corporate clients by restructuring a wide range 
of underlying assets making up its structured finance products, 
diversifying away from the traditional accounts receivable 
to cover redeemable convertible preference shares, project 
finance loans, and intellectual property rights. The Bank will also 
target innovators pivoting toward digital and green transitions, 
assisting them with their issuance of equity-linked notes.As for the international bond business, the Bank plans to 
step up its investment banking capacity by enlarging its IB 
desk in Hong Kong while committing to increasing its global 
and cross-border deal volume by actively targeting strong 
corporate clients, both Korean and non-Korean.Landmark Deals of 2021Joint Arranger for Korean Government's Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund BondKDB successfully arranged the Korean government’s USD 1.3 billion Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Bond offering in Octo-
ber 2021. The bond was met by strong market demand and was issued in two tranches – a USD 500 million tranche and EUR 700 
million tranche – each pricing at a spread of 25bps and 13bps.Demand for Korean paper in the global markets remained strong despite the US Fed’s warning at the late September FOMC to 
taper and reduce its balance sheet, the Evergrande Group crisis in China, global inflation concerns, and other macroeconomic 
challenges driving up market volatility. The bond was four to six times oversubscribed, reaffirming international confidence in the 
Korean economy. The euro tranche, in particular, was issued at a negative interest rate, drawing keen interest from investors as 
the first-ever Asian sovereign green bond designed to fund green projects like renewable energy.As the only Korean IB in the joint lead manager group, KDB further solidified its position as a funding partner to the Korean 
government in the international markets while making substantial contribution to reinforce investor trust in Korea.Issue SizeMaturity DateUSD 500 million

REVIEW OF 2021KDB provides financial advisory services specializing in M&A 
at home and abroad, and arranges acquisition financing for 
corporate clients, enabling them to secure necessary funding 
and manage appropriate capital structures.M&A deal count and size both reached record highs in 2021, 
driven by Covid19 pandemic recovery. With an influx of liquidity 
and industry-transforming M&A transactions taking place 
in the backdrop, KDB made a special effort to provide M&A 
advisory and strategic consulting services to Korean SMEs and 
MEs to better support their response to a changing business 
environment. Following the previous year, KDB continued 
its contributions in Korea to the biomedical industry, a high-
growth sector. KDB’s biomedical industry work includes multiple 
advisory engagements on business and technology transfers.KDB has made a push to enhance its cross-border M&A 
advisory capabilities by setting up a M&A desk with dedicated 
professionals in Hong Kong, a global financial center. The 
Bank’s Hong Kong M&A desk has continued its networking 
activities with global investment banks despite the challenges 
presented by the Covid19 pandemic, successfully closing 
multiple acquisition finance transactions. The Bank’s track 
record in Hong Kong has generated considerable fees and 
contributed to building the Bank’s global presence.PLANS FOR 2022With pandemic response capabilities improving worldwide, 
the global economy is expected to continue its recovery from 
the Covid19 pandemic. Meanwhile, increased interest rates 
will decrease market liquidity, in turn pressuring the global 
M&A market versus the previous year. Separately, the overall 
decreased liquidity supply will drive more restructuring-focused 
M&A activity of companies in crisis. The Bank also expects 
business adjustments in response to industry transformations 
driven by ESG and digitalization trends to continue from 2021.KDB will seek to contribute to developing a foundation for 
growth for the Korean economy. The Bank will not only 
support Korean companies in securing future growth engines 
through M&A, but will also actively engage in M&A advisory 
and consulting work for companies requiring restructuring of 
capital structure and business operations. Globally, the Bank 
will continue to collaborate with global partner advisors to build 
its cross-border M&A advisory capabilities. The Bank aims for 
its M&A advisory work to provide a strong footing for Korean 
businesses in their global go-to-market efforts.Consulting

and commercial viability by targeting areas that lack sufficient

its experience to carry out a wide range of advisory projects, 
collaborating across different departments within the Bank in the 
process. The Bank completed targeted consulting programs for 
high-growth companies, helping digital platform start-ups design 
corporate strategies and refine their business models. KDB also 
advised a medium-sized Korean pharmaceutical company to 
establish their overseas office, directly helping a Korean business 
enter a new market and capture new growth drivers.PLANS FOR 2022While the Korean economy is expected to show gradual signs of 
recovery, a prolonged pandemic, supply chain disruption, inflation 
pressures, and heightening of international disputes will present 
challenges to a full recovery. Amidst such uncertainties, the 
Bank sees more policies forthcoming that will promote growth 
in digitalization, carbon neutrality, and other areas with potential 
to unlock new industries and their growth. In anticipation of a 
shifting environment ahead, KDB will continue offering its one-
stop advisory services aimed at promoting the country’s SMEs 
and MEs and creating a vibrant and extensive start-up ecosystem.Private Equity

formation of a bank-led alliance and forums to promote open 
innovation in the country. In preparation of the post-Covid19 
era, and in light of variety of factors including the public good, 
research complexity, and expected investment returns, the

earnings. The Bank will promote the expansion of its presence

digital trading platforms to upgrade trading capability, keeping 
the Bank at the forefront of the Korean derivatives market.TradingF/X & Derivatives TradingKDB pioneered the Korean F/X and derivatives market in the 
1980s when market activity was virtually nonexistent. Over the 
past decades, the Bank has built up broad expertise required to 
deal with a wide variety of products ranging from F/X, swaps, 
options, and other more common forms of derivatives to more 
complex structured products, providing hedging solutions 
tailored to the need of each of its corporate clients. Now, as

expansion of the Korean economy.REVIEW OF 2021The global economy made a significant turnaround in 2021 
with increased investments, low levels of unemployment, and 
consistent rise in prices, driven by worldwide distribution of the

opportunities in the global financial markets.REVIEW OF 2021KDB pioneered Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) in the 
Korean banking industry amidst record volatilities in the 
market, streamlining investment decisions on USD assets 
and enhancing stability of its portfolio through optimal asset 
allocation and periodic rebalancing.KDB also worked to diversify its portfolio; the Bank pioneered 
CNY bond lending and borrowing and expanded exposure 
to KRW corporate bonds. The Bank’s headquarters has co-
worked with the Bank’s overseas entities to strengthen its risk 
management framework, implementing limits for issuers of 
foreign currency-denominated securities.PLANS FOR 2022In 2022, the Bank will aim to further enhance stability of its 
mid- to long-term portfolio as it extends the SAA strategy to 
KRW and CNY assets. The Bank’s headquarters will co-work

and efficiency.At the same time, the Bank will conduct regular reviews on key 
indices to encourage reduction of exposure to at-risk securities,

most prominent banks.Going forward, KDB will continue to provide loans and other 
capital markets arrangements coupled with a comprehensive 
spectrum of corporate banking products spanning project

derivatives to Korean businesses expanding globally. In doing 
so, the Bank will work toward its goal of becoming one of the 
top 20 banks in the world and a top-tier CIB in Asia.042043REVIEW OF 2021KDB seeks to capture stable funding sources and new revenue 
streams, while serving as a gateway for Korean businesses 
expanding globally. As of the end of 2021, KDB has overseas 
presence across 18 countries - one regional head office in 
Asia, ten branches, seven subsidiaries, and eight representative

its subsidiaries while branches concentrate on corporate 
banking. In extension to the Bank’s incumbent leadership in the 
Korean start-up ecosystem, KDB has opened a venture capital 
subsidiary in Silicon Valley. KDB Silicon Valley LLC commenced

joined the D20-LTIC, pledging its cooperation on carbon neutrality 
and sustainable development with other development finance 
institutions at an annual meeting held in Italy. KDB also signed 
an MOU in November with China Development Bank to further 
the interbank cooperation on syndicated loans and funding 
operations. In December, the Bank held its annual workshop 
with Mizuho Bank online, successfully organizing six working-

developing the Bank’s global partnership despite pandemic-
imposed limitations.PLANS FOR 2022In 2022, KDB seeks to deepen its long-term growth foundation

banking platform in the New Southern region and another one 
in Frankfurt, Germany which will grow into KDB’s green finance 
center in Europe.Moreover, the Bank will divide its overseas branch network into 
China, Hong Kong, Asia, the Americas, and Europe, developing 
a growth strategy for each. By leveraging its hub branches, KDB 
will engage in more mega deals for international clients, increase 
exposure to securities denominated in local currencies and 
expand trade finance transactions with other financial institutions, 
scaling up its operation and assets through strategic localization.Trade FinanceKDB offers a comprehensive spectrum of export and import 
trade finance products to its domestic clients. In addition, 
to identify new sources of profit, the Bank has expanded its 
business to cover inter-bank trade finance risk participation 
transactions intermediated by global banks. KDB was also the 
first Korean financial institution to extend credit lines to banks 
from emerging economies that are guaranteed by international 
financial institutions. Since 2018, KDB has provided trade loans 
to these banks, diversifying its trade finance offerings and 
broadening the inter-FI operation base.The global trade volume saw a significant upsurge in 2021 
driven by increase in government spending and vaccine rollout 
that made way for a turnaround in global economy. South Korea 
also benefited from the external developments, recording gains 
on all fifteen of its main exports and the highest trade value to 
date. KDB was quick to respond to the boom in trade activity, 
carrying out USD 37.2 billion worth of export and import finance 
transactions in 2021, exceeding an annual benchmark of USD 
30 billion for six years in a row.In 2022, KDB will continue providing import/export finance

PensionSince the introduction of retirement pension plans in Korea in 
December 2005, KDB has engaged in the retirement pension 
business as part of its commitment to provide a full spectrum 
of financial solutions tailored to the needs of its clients. In 
managing the retirement funds, KDB fully utilizes its years of 
know-how as a corporate banking specialist.Despite heightened job insecurity from the prolonged Covid19 
pandemic, KDB’s total assets under management recorded 
KRW 7.6 trillion as of the end of 2021, a 7.5% jump from the 
2020 level. This made the Bank the 13th largest pension fund 
among 43 that are currently in operation in Korea.In 2022, KDB will stay vigilant to government demands for 
improvement in retirement pension schemes and increase 
coordination between the head office pension department 
and RMs stationed at individual branches for more effective 
marketing. The Bank will also develop AI-advised portfolio 
programs and upgrade the relevant IT infrastructure to deliver 
stronger returns and a better experience for its customers.TrustSince establishing its money trust business in 1989, KDB 
has expanded its business into property trusts and custody 
services over the years. Through its specialized money trust and 
property products (e.g., real estate security trusts and monetary 
receivables trusts), the Bank offered a stable option to itscorporate clients for managing their spare funds and facilitated 
funding. While undertaking the custody operations for various 
policy finance funds and playing its role as an agent bank, KDB 
has also worked on digitalizing its trust business by applying the 
robotic process automation (RPA).KDB provides a variety of trust options including high-return 
foreign currency instruments (e.g., USD RP, USD-denominated 
notes) to offer custom solutions to its corporate clients looking 
for ways to manage their excess liquidity.With respect to property trusts, the Bank closed 14 new 
monetary receivable trust transactions worth KRW 3.7 trillion 
in 2021 by enhancing collateral capabilities of SMEs through 
accounts receivable, facilitating their financing against the 
challenging environment caused by the pandemic. Of these 
transactions, 62% were made to companies rated BBB or below. 
The Bank has also successfully closed 12 new real estate-
backed trust transactions worth KRW 1.9 trillion.KDB’s average balance for custody increased by KRW 4.9 trillion 
from the previous year, in part due to the Bank’s success in 
securing business related to policy finance funds. The Bank 
made a substantial improvement in its custodian capacity by 
linking its system to the Korea Securities Depository’s fund 
management architecture and strengthened compliance through 
securing greater efficiency and transparency in managing private 
equity funds.Going forward, KDB will remain alert to possible changes to 
Korea’s trust framework that may make way for, among others,

 Corporate Social ResponsibilityESG ReviewLiability ManagementKDB BondsKDB issues Industrial Finance Bonds ('KDB bonds') to procure 
necessary funds that will be used for the development and 
promotion of industries expansion of social infrastructure, regional 
economic development, stabilization of financial markets, and 
facilitation of sustainable growth. KDB's funding activities are in 
accordance with the Korea Development Bank Act. As stipulated in 
the Act, KDB as a state-owned policy bank is protected against the 
risk of insolvency by the government, and its credit risk is considered 
equal to that of the government under Basel III criteria. As a result, 
KDB bonds are issued at the lowest interest rate, next to the Korean 
treasury bonds.KRW-denominatedDespite the spread of Covid19 variants, the Bank of Korea raised 
its benchmark interest rate 0.50% in 2021 to rein in financial 
imbalance as soaring commodity prices and supply disruptions 
pushed up inflationary pressure and reinforced the central bank’s 
hawkish stance.New issuances of KDB bonds totaled KRW 56.1 trillion in 2021, 
with balance outstanding at KRW 111.0 trillion, marking a KRW 
6.3 trillion drop in new issuances and KRW 2.2 trillion increase 
in balance year-on-year. KDB bond issuances exceeded annual 
targets, allowing the Bank to secure sufficient funds to meet 
demands from policy finance.KDB bonds are classified as special bank debentures and KDB 
is the largest issuer in the domestic bond market, behind the 
government and the central bank. In terms of outstanding 
balance, KDB bonds account for the fourth largest share 
following government bonds, monetary stabilization bonds, and 
mortgage backed securities.Moreover, the yields on KDB bonds are widely used by market 
participants such as the Korea Financial Investment Association 
as one of the key benchmarks alongside those on Korean 
treasury bonds and monetary stabilization bonds.KDB is a leading issuer of KRW ESG bonds, issuing a total of 
KRW 800 billion in 2019, and KRW 1.2 trillion in 2020. The Bank 
was a major market maker again in 2021, issuing a total of KRW 
880 billion in ESG bonds including KRW 550 billion in social 
bonds to support companies mitigate the impact of Covid19 and 
promote employment and KRW 330 billion in green bonds.In 2021, KDB became the first to issue Korea’s long-term 
structured green bond (KRW 30 billion) with a call option, 
confirming the Bank’s pioneering role in the Korean domestic 
green bond markets, where existing issuances have been 
dominated by medium-term plain vanillas.Market Yields on Benchmark BondsKorea Treasury Bonds

inflationary pressure, the Bank successfully conducted careful 
analysis with strategic bond issuances and raised USD 7.5 billion 
of foreign currency funds in 2021. KDB completed three global 
bond offerings in the year, serving as a Korean benchmark issuer in 
the international bond market. In particular, KDB’s USD 300 million 
floating rate green note issued in March 2021 was selected the “Best 
Green Bond – Policy Bank” by The Asset Triple A Sustainable Capital 
Markets Country & Regional Awards, reinforcing the Bank’s stature as 
a leading policy finance institution.The Bank also tapped into niche market instruments such as CHF 
bonds and BRL-denominated notes to diversify its investor base 
across geographies. KDB also took action to ensure that it stands 
ready for a post-LIBOR era by issuing floating rate SOFR bonds in 
both public and private markets.In 2022, the Bank's funding strategy will focus on flexibility, bracing for 
potential volatilities in the market stemming from hikes in benchmark 
interest rates by the world’s key economies and geopolitical risks. 
KDB will maintain its commitment as Korea’s benchmark issuer in the 
United States and elsewhere, striving to expand the investor base for 
SSA (Sovereign, Supranational and Agency) bonds in order to improve 
funding conditions for all Korean issuers.DepositsKDB ensures efficient supply of policy funds by utilizing a wide range 
of deposit instruments to supplement funding from KDB bonds 
which can be price-sensitive to market conditions. By securing 
sufficient amount of funds through cost-efficient deposit and money 
market products, KDB strives to disperse its funding risks while 
reducing funding costs to enhance its  operational competitiveness 
with the ultimate goal of more effectively supporting the growth of 
the Korean economy.On top of increased uncertainty from the spread of Covid19 variants, 
money market competition was fierce among banks that also had 
to fend off aggressive product marketing from fintech companies. 
Against this constantly changing environment, KDB’s total deposits 
increased by KRW 1.7 trillion, driven by the Bank’s offering of 
customized solutions and flexible interest rate management 
strategies.Deposits OverviewKRW Deposits

10.9(Unit : 10,000 people)62.860.353.7201920202021Landmark Deals of 2021The launch of ‘KDB-TOSS Savings’KDB announced in June 2021 that it partnered with TOSS, 
a Korean fintech service provider, to launch new products 
targeted at the platform company's customers.The project was a win-win venture for both, with TOSS 
differentiating its platform with a new product, and KDB 
securing additional channel for reaching out to a new 
customer base.This was KDB’s second attempt in partnering with a 
fintech service provider following a collaboration with 
Finnq in 2020, facilitating the Bank’s digital marketing 
capacity to make up for its relatively weak physical 
presence.Going forward, KDB will continue to engage in an active strategy to 
secure deposits from its key clients as a means to enhance stability 
of its funding for policy finance. First, by leveraging its specialty 
in corporate banking, the Bank will increase deposits from its 
institutional clients, SMEs and MEs in particular, orienting away from 
the existing funding structure skewed towards large cap companies. 
In doing so, KDB will align more closely with the government's policy 
direction of better serving the needs of SMEs and MEs. Second, in 
anticipation of greater competition among banks and with fintech 
companies over customers and their payment accounts, KDB will 
bolster partnership with new financial service providers. Through 
this collaboration, KDB will seek to attract more customers and their 
payment accounts including salary and checking accounts with 
relatively low funding costs.Liquidity ManagementKDB closely monitors market conditions and events to swiftly 
adapt to changes in global financial events and take preemptive 
risk management measures to obtain optimal level of liquidity. KDB 
utilizes various short-term instruments not limited to call loans, repo, 
MMF, CP programs, etc. to minimize and efficiently manage surplus 
liquidity. KDB also maintains extensive USD money market lines 
with various central banks and numerous reciprocal money market 
line agreements with global financial institutions. To complement 
the low interest rate money market lines with the central banks 
and SSAs, KDB is also an active issuer of US CPs and Euro CPs in 
international capital markets.Risk ManagementEffective Risk Management by Specialized 
CouncilsKDB operates independent risk management committee and 
council to ensure prompt and effective risk management decision-
making. The Risk Management Committee (RMC) is KDB's 
highest decision-making body that examines important matters 
such as yearly risk management plans and total risk limits for the 
Bank. The RMC members are mainly comprised of independent 
directors with extensive experience and knowledge in finance and 
economic matters. Chaired by one of the independent directors, 
the Committee is armed with a decision-making mechanism that 
ensures balanced views on critical risk management agenda. All 
agenda items resolved by the RMC are reported to the Board of 
Directors.050051In 2021, six RMC meetings were held with a total of 23 agenda 
items being presented for discussion to the committee. Major 
items discussed include the risk management plans for 2021 and 
the country exposure management plans. Other important risk 
management issues were also discussed, such as the results of 
integrated analysis on risk for the second half of 2020 and first half 
of 2021, and verification results for BIS risk weighted assets were 
also reported to the Committee.The Risk Management Council (Council) is composed of Division 
Heads, and its roles and responsibilities include the monitoring 
of the Bank's constant risk variables and the orchestration of 
operations, so that risks can be effectively managed within each 
operation unit. Following the limits set by the RMC, the Council 
discusses and distributes risks among divisions, setting limits for 
trading losses and F/X positions. In 2021, the Council convened 8 
times, discussing the establishment of major 2021 credit portfolios 
and the distribution of internal capital limits.The Asset and Liability Management Committee is comprised of 
the heads of relevant departments who decide on the Bank's asset 
and liability policies, focusing on interest rate and liquidity risks. The 
Committee convened twelve times in 2021 to decide on, among 
others, the limits on the Bank's liquidity coverage and liquidity 
requirements (LCR, NSFR) compliance plans.KDB's Risk Management Principles• Risk must be managed across the Bank in a mannerthat is independent and comprehensive;• Risk must be accurately identified, measured, andevaluated, and then properly managed;• Risk must be maintained at a level in balance to profit;• Risk must be diversified to prevent a buildup of assetsconcentrated in a specific category;• Risk must be managed within certain limits or 
guidelines in order to prevent undue exposure.Key Committees and Councils for Risk ManagementBoard of DirectorsChairChief Risk Officer(Head of Risk Management Division)Risk Management

Credit RiskCredit risk refers to possible losses in the event that debts cannot 
be collected as a result of a failure of counterparties to make 
repayments or to fulfill their payment obligations in other ways. 
While monitoring all assets that are exposed to credit risk, KDB 
also measures and manages credit concentration risk, which can 
occur as a result of excessive exposure to individual companies or 
corporate groups.Market RiskMarket risk refers to possible losses to the Bank's assets resulting 
from fluctuations of interest rates, stock prices, F/X rates, and other 
variables. KDB measures and manages possible losses in trading 
positions, including positions in securities and derivatives held for 
trading, due to negative movements in market indices. Moreover, 
the Bank classifies the severity of market swings into three stages 
- precautionary, semi-crisis, and crisis stages - and operates Market 
Risk Contingency Plans appropriate to each of the three stages. 
KDB also conducts stress tests to measure the potential scale of 
losses based on scenarios replicating significant fluctuations in 
major market indices over the last three years and the financial 
crisis of 2008.Interest rate RiskInterest rate risk refers to possible losses due to interest rate 
fluctuations that cause a decrease in net present value (NPV) or 
net interest income (NII) of rate-sensitive assets and an increase ininterest expenses on rate-sensitive liabilities contained within the 
Bank’s accounts. KDB manages interest rate risks mainly through 
the economic value of equity (EVE) and also employs net interest 
income (NII) as an auxiliary index. Starting at the end of 2019, KDB 
began managing its interest rate risk by measuring interest rate 
risk in the banking book (IRRBB), reporting its IRRBB profile on a 
quarterly basis since then.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is defined as the possibility of potential loss due to a 
temporary shortage in funds caused by a maturity mismatch or an 
unexpected capital outlay. Liquidity risk soars when funding rates 
rise, assets are sold below a normal price, or a good investment 
opportunity is missed. KDB uses Basel III's short-term liquidity 
regulation index, the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), and a mid to long-
term liquidity regulation index, the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) to 
manage its liquidity risks and to meet regulatory requirements.Operational RiskOperational risk refers to possible losses that may occur due to 
inadequate internal processes, system failures, employee errors, as 
well as external events that disrupt business operations. Through a 
Control Self-Assessment (CSA) program, KDB periodically assesses 
that the relevant staff in each department are fully aware of the 
potential operational risks associated with their job functions, and 
can properly manage those risks. The Bank established business 
continuity plans (BCPs) for each job function to prepare for potential 
disruptions due to disasters, strikes, and other emergencies. Annual 
mock drills are held to ensure that major operations can be resumed 
within a target timeframe in the event of an emergency.052053PLANS FOR 2022KDB will continue to improve existing systems to enhance its risk 
management capabilities. The Bank will update its risk management 
framework in line with market and regulatory changes to better 
manage its risk indices and ensure that its risk framework underpins 
the effective execution of policy finance activities.First, the Bank will introduce improvements to its credit analysis 
in preparation to transition to a digital economy and a banking 
business with stronger focus on growth capital. The Bank will adopt 
advanced review guidelines on growth companies and check risk 
management guidelines on New Deal funds, green finance, and 
other policy finance initiatives.Additionally, the Bank will review its internal guidelines to analyze 
how it can apply the Basel’s large exposure standard due to come 
into force in 2022. The Bank will also develop systems to comply 
with revised Basel III Tangible Common Equity (TCE) and Credit 
Value Adjustment (CVA) standards scheduled to become effective 
in 2023 as well as other changes in the market and operational risk 
frameworks.Lastly, the Bank plans to step-up monitoring of its assets to prepare 
against any losses that may have materialized in the prolonged 
course of the Covid19 pandemic.Management for Soundness of KDB’s AssetsKDB  categorizes  the  soundness  of  its  assets  "normal", 
"precautionary", "substandard", "doubtful" or "estimated loss" based 
on an evaluation of the possibility of insolvency and sets aside loan 
loss provisions according to the categorization of its assets. In 
addition, the Bank makes reasonable estimates of the probability 
of defaults as well as losses based on defaults, and sets aside 
adequate levels of loan loss provisions using the expected credit 
loss (ECL) impairment model in line with the International Financial 
Reporting Standards 9.The Bank constantly strives to minimize insolvencies by 
strengthening credit approval criteria based on asset soundness  
and managing portfolio concentration. If assets are classified as 
non-performing, KDB pursue measures to normalize business 
operations through business restructuring, or manage the assets 
through sales or write-offs.Risk Management Activities
REVIEW OF 2021KDB has consistently updated its risk management framework to 
respond to changing market conditions and to better support the 
government’s policy finance initiatives. The Bank’s risk framework 
prioritizes sustainability of its business.KDB was an active player in public sector finance, analyzing risk 
factors for each Korean New Deal program, supporting the Bank's 
negotiation with government on capital increase and building 
internal review guidelines for ‘new industry’ innovators.Furthermore, the Bank has calculated its BIS ratios in line with 
revised Basel III credit risk framework since late 2020; additional 
work is underway to implement Basel III market and operational risk 
changes at the system level before the revisions come into full force 
in 2023. With respect to the introduction of initial margin exchanges 
in the non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives market, the Bank 
reinforced its market risk management capabilities by verifying 
relevant quantitative models.Similar to 2020, the Bank has set aside additional reserves to 
meet any costs arising from companies failing to meet their 
debt obligations due to the prolonged pandemic. The Bank also 
organized supervisory meetings to monitor the adequacy of the 
Bank’s assets in a pre-emptive measure to engage in early action to 
mitigate any impact from distressed companies.IT & DigitalizationREVIEW OF 2021Contactless interactions in the workplace has become the norm in 
2021 as the pandemic continued on. Traditional financial institutions 
experienced further threats to their businesses from the rise of 
digital banking, Big Tech’s deeper push into finance, and a string of 
new fintechs altering the financial landscape.In 2021, KDB re-organized its IT unit to more efficiently execute 
the bank-wide digital transition, enabling agile and on-demand 
response to project needs. Under the three overarching themes 
of ‘automation,’ ‘contactless interaction’ and ‘decision making 
derived from AI and data science,’ the Bank has set about 
digitizing its operations, starting with corporate banking.AutomationThe first phase of the RPA-enabled automation project 
completedKDB implemented bank-wide robotic process automation (RPA) 
projects, automating 44 tasks resulting in replacing 115,000 
hours of human labor with robots yearly. In addition to RPA, 
the Bank optimized processes in several work streams, saving 
another 30,000 hours of human labor yearly.Contactless interactionDigitization of retail and corporate banking transactionsKDB strengthened its deposit taking functions by digitizing the 
process that had previously been done face-to-face at the Bank’s 
branches, while enhancing customer experience by upgrading 
the Bank’s mobile banking UI/UX designs. At the same time, 
the Bank has launched development of an online system that 
will allow corporate clients to take out loans without having 
to physically visit a branch. The Bank also opened an online 
platform for its venture vehicle, the KDB NextRound, to better 
identify and give support to start-ups which had only been 
available offline.AI and Data ScienceEarly stage development of the Bank’s own AI platformKDB pooled a wide array of financial and non-financial data to 
develop its own ‘AI Corporate Credit Analytic Model.’ The Bank 
also began the early stage work for its flagship IT infrastructure 
project that will make way for KDB’s own AI platform for applying 
data science to the Bank’s corporate banking operation. This 
initiative effectively laid a cornerstone in establishing what KDB 
envisions as a data-based decision-making and policy financing 
system.054055PLANS FOR 2022The Korean financial markets in 2022 will be a battleground between 
traditional financial institutions determined to defend their business 
turf and a band of Big Techs and fintech companies that are armed 
with advanced technology and modern corporate cultures. The 
traditional players are aggressively hiring tech experts to reclaim 
their lost territory and are make their own bids for the platform 
business models. All of these are pointing to an accelerated digital 
innovations across the entire Korean financial markets and the 
impact of AI on the finance sector will only multiply with time.In 2022, KDB will continue to push forward with its bank-wide 
digitalization effort guided by the three principles of ‘automation,’ 
‘contactless interaction’ and ‘AI and data science.’ In follow-up 
to the previous year, the Bank will pursue the second phase of 
the RPA-enabled automation project to further create a working 
environment that relieves its workforce from repetitive labor, 
allowing them to focus more on enhancing client value through 
policy financing tools. On the retail front, the Bank will reinforce 
its mobile infrastructure to maximize customer satisfaction 
and convenience, ideally removing the need to visit a branch 
altogether. With respect to corporate banking, the Bank will work 
toward successfully launching its own AI platform, completing 
the groundwork for enabling a data-based decision-making 
system, which will allow the Bank to utilize its mass financial 
data accumulated over the years and apply them to various AI-
enabled analytic models. In this way, KDB aims to reinforce its 
role in fostering the growth of Korean industries and businesses 
while also leading the country’s digitalization effort by providing 
the most advanced and up-to-date corporate banking services to 
its clients.KDB AI Platform OverviewAI-based

Data Insight PortalEthical ManagementKDB has in place effective internal control measures designed to 
prevent financial malpractices from taking place and to comply 
with a full range of legal and regulatory requirements including 
anti-money laundering rules. As a public organization, the Bank 
regularly monitors and improves its anti-corruption measures and 
implements a variety of compliance programs to promote business 
ethics across the Bank’s day-to-day operations. KDB also conducts 
customized training sessions for its employees to reinforce a 
workplace culture based on integrity and transparency.REVIEW OF 2021The Bank placed a particular emphasis on corruption prevention, 
ethical management, and proactive business administration in 
2021 in light of the prolonged Covid19 pandemic. In promoting 
proactive business administration and in the process of providing 
various support mechanisms, KDB ensured that its practices reflect 
transparency and are carried out in a way that prevents corruption 
and minimizes potential risk factors.For example, KDB institutionalized a system to implement the newly 
established Act on Prohibition of False Claims for Public Funds and 
Recovery of Illicit Profits, made it mandatory for the Bank’s senior 
management to participate in anti-corruption sessions organized 
by the national Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission 
and conducted customized compliance training for all levels of 
employees focusing on areas prone to corruption. The Bank also 
engaged its clients to participate in its compliance campaigns 
through various activities and events, promoting awareness and 
a culture of business ethics across the board. As a result of these 
efforts, KDB was given the second highest rating in the national 
review of public organizations’ anti-corruption practices in 2021. The 
Bank also received the International Standards Organization’s anti-
bribery management systems certification (ISO 37001).In follow-up to a systematic review of the impact of its business 
operations on human rights including their actual and potential 
human rights-related risks conducted in 2020, the Bank upgraded 
its human rights checklist in 2021 by incorporating the implications 
of issues like Covid19 and ESG management into KDB’s business 
ethics, employees’ right to work, and workplace safety. In addition, 
KDB carried out in-depth studies of the industry’s business ethics 
and the relevant practices, actively applying this knowledge to 
improving the Bank’s own internal grievance procedures.In response to the government’s effort to crackdown on 
organizational power abuses, KDB has established and is operating 
multiple reporting centers and strengthened the function of the 
KDB Help Line, its anonymous reporting outlet via a social platform 
Kakao Talk, expanding professional counseling services and 
preventive steps to stop workplace power tripping and facilitate 
effective remedial action.056057Separately, KDB has significantly improved its institutional 
capacity for anti-money laundering (AML) in line with tightening 
regulations worldwide that demand thorough compliance by 
financial institutions. The Bank conducted in-depth AML analyses 
on its overseas entities from 2020 and 2021, producing a detailed 
checklist to bring the Bank’s AML framework up to global standards. 
The Bank has since created a dedicated AML/Sanction Compliance 
team to proactively manage AML-related risks as the Bank expands 
its global business coverage.PLANS FOR 2022In 2022, the Bank expects stronger demand for higher ethical 
standards in the public service, calling for, among others, greater 
crackdown on organizational power abuses, business integrity, and 
anti-corruption. In order to comply with the range of international 
and domestic regulatory requirements, KDB will have to step up and 
further sophisticate its internal compliance system.Major Compliance Management ProgramsProgramsCompliance MonitoringConducts monitoring on compliance reports, self-inspection reports from branches, and monthly

– which support the Bank’s goal to create a society of ‘Helping Hands and Warmer People.’ In 2021, the Bank switched existing volunteer 
programs to financial aid, delivery of the pandemic-related goods and necessities, and other contactless community support programs to 
prevent further spread of the virus. In particular, the Bank ramped up ESG-derived community service practices, including environmental 
preservation and marine life protection activities at national parks.Love of Neighbors
KDB Helping HandsKDB identifies and provides welfare access to underprivileged 
neighbors in welfare blind spots to realize ‘Love of Neighbors.’ The 
Bank co-worked with the National Police Agency to support victims 
of crime, lent support to artists struck by the Covid19 pandemic, 
and delivered funds to children with rare incurable diseases.Fall/Winter Season Kimchi DriveEach year since 2008, KDB employees and their spouses team up 
with volunteers from Seoul’s Saemaeul volunteer group to deliver 
hand-made fall/winter-season kimchi to the elderly living alone and 
others in need. The past two years were exceptions due to the Covid19 
pandemic and the Bank instead purchased kimchi made with locally 
grown ingredients and delivered the packages to partner welfare 
facilities as well as 1,200 underprivileged families across Seoul.Regular Sharing EventsIn partnership with the Yeongdeungpo Senior Welfare Center, 
KDB visits elderly people living alone to deliver rice and other daily 
necessities, as well as goods needed to stay warm during the 
winter. The Bank also take part in a wide range of volunteer activities 
including the provision of free meals, financial donations, holding 
special activities on major national holidays such as lunar new year's 
day or Korean thanksgiving, as well as fundraising and volunteering 
activities involving all employees at the end of each year.Blood Donation CampaignKDB runs a blood donation campaign encouraging all employees to 
participate, with the aim of helping pediatric patients with leukemia. 
In 2021, instead of holding conventional blood donation campaigns, 
the Bank carried out a certificate delivery campaign to recent the 
spread of Covid19.To this end, KDB will continue to strengthen its efforts to prevent 
violations of both internal and external regulations such as the 
Bank’s own Code of Conduct and the national Improper Solicitation 
and Graft Act. The Bank will also promote a whistleblower 
system to put a halt to any corruption or power abuse by its staff. 
KDB will continue to develop novel training methods to step up 
integrity among all of its employees, running regular campaigns to 
encourage integrity and ethics Bank-wide.Additionally in 2022, the Bank plans to conduct detailed legal training 
for departments and teams that are subject to conflict of interest 
regulations.The Bank will draft detailed common standards for global anti-
money laundering measures, standardize common work processes, 
and develop tools to improve the quality of compliance work. 
KDB will also work on developing its human resources and other 
assets; it will revamp reporting procedures and organizations as 
it transitions to a committee-based governance system, boost its 
professionals’ expertise, and upgrade and acquire IT infrastructure.With respect to sanctions, the Bank intends to implement a Sanction 
Compliance Program (SCP) to better manage sanction risks as 
the Bank’s global business develops. KDB will aim to devise a KDB-
specific program that not only suits the Bank’s special needs but 
also meets global regulatory standards.KDB believes its fast-mover stance on sanction risks is critical to 
securing a stable global business foundation and building global 
brand value. The Bank will devise internal frameworks to take 
ownership of sanction risks from key markets while reinforcing trade 
monitoring, reporting, and Know Your Customer (KYC) obligations

biosphere reserve region. KDB provided financial support toward 
restoring wildlife in the area, making contribution to Korea’s 2050 
carbon neutrality goals in the process. The Bank plans to continually 
expand ESG-derived community service activity.Employee DonationsKDB collects the last four digits from employees' monthly paycheck, 
less than KRW 10,000 per employee, and donates the sum in the 
form of scholarships and financial support to low-income and 
single-parent households.EducationKDB provided a career development program for teenagers from 
low-income families facing difficulties in choosing their career path. 
The Bank also supported various symposiums and conferences 
that study topics related to overcoming the Covid19 pandemic and 
promoting the development of finance in Korea.CultureKDB's diverse Mecenat activities bring culture, arts, and sports 
closer to the public. The Bank also sponsors a wide range of arts 
and cultural events while making opportunities for less popular 
forms of art. In 2021, the Bank sponsored the Joint Concert where 
artists with disabilities held a concert together with an orchestra, 
creating opportunities for such artist to perform on stage.Love of Nation
One Company for One Village and One Company for One 
Platoon CampaignsKDB’s One Company for One Village campaign was launched in 
2004 to promote rural-urban partnerships and better integrate 
growth between them. As part of this effort, the Bank periodically 
organizes events to purchase specialty produce from partner 
villages. The Bank also launched a military variation of this program 
in 2012, through which the Bank employees supports soldiers 
serving in the military.060061KDB FoundationSince its establishment in 2007, the KDB Foundation runs projects in three areas - socially responsible finance, community service and talent 
development. The foundation aims to identify blind spots in the country's welfare system and establish a policy foundation through preemptive 
and strategic intervention. A total of 10 projects are currently in progress reflecting KDB's commitment to sustainable finance.Youth Start-up Support ProjectThe Youth Start-up Support Project and the Social Enterprise Support 
Project are making both direct and indirect contributions to Korea's 
job market. The Youth Start-up Support Project, which consists of 
KDB Start-up Program and KDB Start-up Education Program, aims to 
build a start-up ecosystem for new growth industry by discovering and 
fostering young entrepreneurs. In 2021, a total of 630 teams applied 
for the KDB startup Program, with 25 teams making it to the semi-final 
round. The selected teams received professional support and training, 
including mentoring and opportunities to get access to venture capital.Of these, seven finalists received a total of KRW 200 million as start-
up funding, along with opportunities for follow-up funding rounds 
and support programs. The ‘KDB Entrepreneur Training Program’ is 
being offered as a regular course at fifteen universities nationwide, 
benefiting 855 students to date and serving as a catalyst for 
spreading an entrepreneurial mindset among college students and 
identifying new start-ups. KDB has identified 181 start-up teams 
through its ‘Young Start-up Support Project’ from 2013 to 2021, 
of which 152 have actually started a business of their own. As of 
November 2021, KDB’s work has generated 1,981 jobs and KRW 
156.9 billion in cumulative revenue. Furthermore, KDB has offered 
mid to long-term follow-up support through its start-up platforms 
NextRound and NextONE, giving young entrepreneurs access to IR 
activities and incubation programs.KDB Social Enterprise Support ProjectThe Bank supported a total of 12 social enterprises in 2021 through 
its ‘KDB Social Enterprise Support Project,’ which was established 
with the goal of discovering competent social enterprises, providing 
employment opportunities to the socially vulnerable, and equipping 
them with the necessary infrastructure. The Project goes beyond 
financial aid to offer a holistic and sustainable business support 
mechanism run by professional entrepreneurs. Unlike most other 
programs of a similar nature, the KDB Social Enterprise Support 
Project allows partner enterprises to use KDB’s funding to purchase 
production facilities, directly financing their infrastructure needs. 
Partner enterprises leverage this opportunity to develop new 
products, obtain HACCP certification, register patents, and penetrate 
online and offline sales channels to generate a stable revenue 
stream. The Bank recently added an accelerator program to deliver 
professional training and an impact investing event to five selected 
companies, connecting one company with additional fundraising 
opportunity. A total of 68 social enterprises have received KDB 
funds and mentorship support from 2015 to 2021, and in 2021 
alone, partner enterprises contributed to the creation of 294 jobs for 
the vulnerable workers group including the physically disabled while 
also driving the growth in revenue.Development Finance CooperationKDB was established in Korea’s post-war era as a development finance institution with the goal of reconstructing and promoting the national 
economy. The Bank has since served a critical role in the Korean financial markets, supplying liquidity and stabilizing markets in line with 
changing government policies. The Bank has now reached a position to leverage more than sixty years of development finance expertise to 
support the governments and financial institutions in developing economies, while using these engagements as opportunities to develop the 
Bank’s global business base. The Bank also has a significant research capacity for the economics, industry, and finance of North Korea, in 
preparation for potential denuclearization by Pyeongyang and the possible inter-Korean economic cooperation and North Korean economic 
development activities that may follow.REVIEW OF 2021In 2021, KDB pursued an in-depth research in response to changing 
political environment surrounding the Korean peninsula, while 
continuing its work on transferring development finance expertise 
to developing economy partners. Specifically, the Bank analyzed 
the impact of Northeast Asian issues including the U.S-China 
conflict on the political economy of the Korean peninsula. It also 
elaborated on the KDB Experience Sharing Program established in 
2020 to propose a financial model that may be used by developing 
economies as a guidance to deepen and further reinforce their 
financial systems and economic developments. To this end, KDB 
leveraged its global branches and offices to render assistance to 
developing economy partners in Asia in particular, enhancing their 
development finance capabilities.PLANS FOR 2022KDB will maintain its research focus on North Korean economy 
and business, while pursuing additional opportunities to share 
its Development Finance Model in partnerships with developing 
economies. The Bank intends to take its North Korea research 
capacity a step further by stimulating academic dialogues and 
exchanges on North Korean economics and the shifting political 
dynamics surrounding the Korean peninsula such as the North 
Korea Policy Forum. The Bank will also respond to changing global 
economic paradigms triggered by climate change, pursuing joint 
projects with international financial institutions to ramp up green 
financing capabilities of developing economies.ESGREVIEW0632021 ESG HighlightsHIGHLIGHTS 1Groundwork Completed for Effective 
Implementation of Sustainable  
 
ManagementIn early 2021, the Bank reorganized its Strategy and Planning 
Division into a Strategy and Green Finance Planning Division, 
also adding a new department to serve as a control tower for 
the Bank’s overall activities concerning ESG strategies, green 
finance, and the implementation of the Korean New Deal.Further, to systematically control and coordinate the various 
sustainability initiatives scattered across the institution and 
to enable a more effective response mechanism to emerging 
sustainability issues, KDB launched a sustainability committee 
as a task force chaired by the Head of the Strategy and Green 
Finance Planning Division. This committee is expected to  
provide a platform for an agile cooperation among the relevant 
departments within the Bank and foster an efficient response 
system.KDB Sustainability CommitteeSustainability CommitteeHead of Strategy and Green Finance Planning DivisionGreen Finance Sub-CommitteeKorean New Deal Sub-CommitteeESG Sub-Committee•   Develop green products and services and

•   Pursue environmental managementKDB was established to “contribute to the sound development of the financial 
industry and the national economy of Korea” as per Article 1 of the KDB Act. To 
this end, the Bank has strived to increase the country’s sustainability through 
embodying its mission of “being an advanced policy bank at the forefront of 
Korea’s sustainable growth.”Specifically, KDB supported the SMEs and MEs that lack the capacity and 
resources for sustainable development through a range of tools and products 
derived from the Bank’s green and socially responsible finance. KDB’s work with 
these companies has induced them to place greater emphasis on ESG values 
in their day-to-day business practices. Recognizing the essential role of policy 
finance institutions in tackling climate change, KDB has also stepped up its 
commitment to green finance, engaging in an increasing array of activities to 
drive a low carbon transition of Korean companies and industries and to facilitate 
a climate resilient business ecosystems in the country.Moreover, in order to avoid, minimize, and/or address any negative environmental 
and social impact from the Bank’s business activities, KDB has established 
and is effectively implementing environmental and social risk guidelines, which 
are aligned to the Equator Principles (EPs). From a governance perspective, 
KDB actively practiced corporate social responsibility through environmentally 
sustainable business management, human rights empowerment, ethical integrity, 
and legal compliance, aiming to bring the notion of “a responsible bank” closer to 
the heart of its corporate identity. As a practical application of this effort, the Bank 
has continually expanded the adoption of green vehicles, goods, and renewable 
energy facilities at its buildings and throughout daily operation.064065HIGHLIGHTS 2Growing Leadership in Korea’s Green FinanceGiven Korea’s scarce renewable energy resources and the 
economy’s heavy reliance on carbon-intensive and export-
driven industries, attaining carbon neutrality by 2050 is an 
ambitious task that cannot be delivered without a large-scale 
green finance to speed up energy transition and promote 
development/commercialization of carbon reduction 
technologies.As a leader in Korea’s green finance, KDB has reinforced 
its role as a policy financial catalyst to channel the 
market’s liquidity to green sectors to address the massive 
investment needs over long-term horizons. Specifically, 
the Bank has taken on some of the private sector’s burden 
by providing junior capital through subordinate financing,creating an enabling environment for private sector to  
participate in the field.In line with the Korean government’s policy on carbon 
neutrality and the environmental goals under the K-Taxonomy, 
the Bank has selected four areas as the target of its green 
finance initiatives: 1) promoting energy transition, 2) creating 
a low-carbon industrial structure, 3) fostering low-carbon 
ecosystems and 4) building an environmentally sustainable 
society. Utilizing the Bank’s spectrum of green products and 
services including the KDB Carbon Spread Program, the Bank 
has allocated KRW 11 trillion, or 13.2% of its overall financing 
to green sectors in 2021. KDB aims to push this figure to KRW 
13.2 trillion, or 16.8% of the total financing, by 2030.KDB Green Financing Strategy OverviewGOVERNMENT

facilitate a low-carbon transition of Korea’s high emission 
industries and foster the growth of new and climate resilient 
business innovators in the country. Of the KRW 5 trillion, KRW 
2 trillion was set apart as carbon reduction funds, requiring, 
for the first time in Korea, the recipients of the funds to receive 
external verification of their carbon reduction effects, avoiding 
greenwashing and making a tangible impact on carbon 
reduction. Since its launch in April 2021 to the end of the year, 
the KDB Carbon Spread Program has provided approximately 
KRW 1.9 trillion of funds to 30 eligible companies in Korea.Carbon ReductionLow Carbon EcosystemObjectiveInduce carbon reduction by carbon-

to cultivate social value through its financing activities. The 
Bank was active in a range of initiatives in 2021 to support 
Korea’s robust business ecosystems, including growth 
programs for start-ups, SMEs and MEs. The Bank also offered 
socially responsible financing programs designed to create 
jobs, stimulate local economies, and promote a shared 
growth. To help deal with the fallout from the pandemic, KDB 
has reached out to affected companies with liquidity programs 
aimed at expediting their recovery and restoring financial

  >  Support for the TCFDIn response to heightening climate signals, the Financial 
Stability Board (FSB) established the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to help companies 
identify, assess, and manage their climate risks.As one of the leaders in Korea’s green finance, KDB declared 
its support for the TCFD in May 2021, along with 13 other 
financial institutions in the country. The Bank plans to 
follow this up with detailed guidelines on the phased-in 
implementation of its disclosure of climate-related financial 
risk around the four thematic areas specified in the TCFD 
recommendations: governance, strategy, risk management, 
and metrics and targets. In doing so, KDB aims to establish 
a more systematic approach to its climate risk management 
going forward.TCFD RecommendationsGovernanceStrategyDisclose the organization's oversight on 
climate-related issues and the management 
board's assessment and management of

those steps are integrated into existing risk 
management processes.Metrics and 
TargetsDisclose the metrics and targets used to 
measure and manage relevant climate-related 
risks and opportunities as well as corporate's 
exposure to climate-related issue.>  E&S Risk ManagementKDB's approach to tackling E&S risks in project-related 
transactions follow the Equator Principles (EPs), the finance 
industry's gold standard for E&S risk management. The 
process starts by categorizing projects based on the 
significance of their potential E&S risks and impacts. In the 
course of E&S due diligence, KDB reviews client’s compliance 
with the EPs requirements, such as identifying potential E&S 
impacts and incorporating measures to avoid, minimize, 
mitigate, and/or compensate for the adverse impacts into 
project design. KDB ensures that financing documentation 
includes covenants linked to EPs compliance and reviews the 
client’s E&S monitoring reports over the life of the loan.Since adopting the EPs in January 2017, KDB has reviewed 
a total of 163 credit transactions that fell within the scope of 
the Principles, including 49 in 2021 alone that were valued 
approximately at KRW 5.5 trillion. The Bank was designated 
Asia-Oceania Regional Representative in October 2021 by the 
EP Steering Committee in recognition for its EP-compliant 
credit review capabilities and work toward promoting the EPs.As one of the 42 Asia-Oceania regional signatories of the 
EPs, KDB seeks to establish ground as a standard setter 
in environmental and social review and conduct a range of 
activities toward enhancing the E&S review capabilities of 
Asia-Oceania region member institutions and promoting 
consistency in adoption of the Principles.KDB's E&S risk management process1

various international organizations and initiatives to contribute to the joint effort of greening the planet.>  GCF Accredited Entity>  P4G Seoul SummitIn December 2016, KDB became the first and only Korean 
financial institution accredited by the Green Climate Fund 
(GCF). GCF is dedicated to assisting developing countries 
in mitigation and adaptation practices to counter climate 
change. As an accredited entity, KDB serves as the Fund’s 
financial partner to identify opportunities of cooperation, 
utilizing the various financing tools at its disposal, including 
PF, indirect investment and on-lending. In 2021, as a response 
to the UNFCCC’s emphasis on the importance of developing 
and transferring technologies to developing countries, KDB 
proposed a programme designed to address the climate 
technology needs of the four ASEAN countries and to support 
their climate technology incubators and accelerators. In 
July, the Bank received a USD 1.2 million Project Preparation 
Facility (PPF) from GCF to support the development of 
the programme. Once approved by the GCF board, the 
programme will set up an investment fund of USD100 million 
to promote innovative technology solutions and empower 
local ecosystems for climate technopreneurship in the target 
countries. Separately, KDB will continue to come up with 
tools such as on-lending programs and initiatives to support 
developing countries’ mitigation and adaptation efforts and to 
help improve energy efficiency in outdated industrial facilities 
located in various parts of Southeast Asia and supporting the 
establishment a local green investment body.In May 2021, KDB jointly organized the 2021 P4G1) Green 
Finance Special Session with the Financial Services 
Commission (FSC) and participated in a panel discussion on 
“the Role of Finance: Fostering Green Recovery in the post- 
Covid19 Era” with local and international opinion leaders2) in

green finance in responding to climate change and greening 
the economy. KDB’s Chairman & CEO Mr. Dong-gull Lee placed 
a special emphasis on the Bank’s role in supplying patient 
capital at scale to encourage private sector participation and 
hence facilitating fundamental changes in the economic and 
industrial structures.1)  Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030: A global

source 100% renewable electricity by 2040 in support of 
the country’s 2050 net zero ambitions. To this end, KDB has 
installed solar power systems in its new data center in Hanam 
and education facility, saving approximately KRW 60 million 
on energy costs yearly. The Bank will also explore purchasing 
Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), which count as 
a carbon offset, and utilizing third-party power purchase 
agreements as part of the practical application of its corporate 
social responsibility as well as organizing energy saving 
campaigns to enhance social awareness on energy and the 
environment.EV Chargers installed

cars with EVs and hydrogen vehicles by 2024, continually 
expanding the necessary charging infrastructure in support of 
this goal. In 2021, the Bank replaced 77 of its existing vehicles 
with eco-friendly options and installed a total of 10 chargers (6 
Standard at KDB HQ, 2 Standard and 2 High-Speed at Hanam 
Digital Square).ESG BondIssuance of Foreign   
 
Currency-denominated Green BondsSince issuing its inaugural green bond in 2017, KDB has 
repeatedly issued green bonds in and outside Korea. In 2021 
alone, the Bank successfully issued USD 700 million fixed-rate 
green bonds respectively in January and October, and Asia’s 
first SEC-registered SOFR-linked USD 300 million green bond 
in March. The bond was significant for KDB as it provided 
momentum to facilitate the use of alternative benchmark rates 
and also diversified its funding sources for ESG financing. 
The Bank’s effort to issue green bonds in more variety of 
currencies continued in 2021, including a CHF200 million 
green bond in Switzerland, a leading ESG finance market, and 
a USD 100 million-equivalent green bond denominated in the 
IDR. As one of Korea’s anchor issuers, KDB was also the first 
in Korea to issue a derivative-linked structured green bond in 
a foreign currency, actively exploring different formats of ESG 
bonds and contributing to the growth of the market.Foreign Currency ESG Bond Issuance Track

in renewable energy (solar power, hydrogen power), green 
transportation (trains, ships, electric vehicle parts), pollution 
prevention and management (synthetic resin recycling), and 
energy efficiency (waste heat power generation). Since issuing 
Korea’s first green and social bonds in the domestic markets 
in 2018, each amounting to KRW 300 billion, KDB has been 
a significant market maker with a steady issuance of ESG 
bonds every year. Furthermore, the Bank responded early in 
December 2020 to industry doubts related to ESG washing1), 
clearing external reviews to secure transparency in its reports 
and the trust of investors. KDB has contributed significantly to 
the growth of the Korean ESG bond market and consolidated

Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsManagement’s Discussion and AnalysisThe 2021 financial statements prepared by KDB conform to Korean International Financial Reporting Standards (K-IFRS). 
K-IFRS refers to Korea’s adoption of the standards and interpretations released by the International Accounting Standards 
Board. The 2021 financial statements of KDB cover financial performance from January 1 to December 31 of the year, and the 
financial figures in this Management’s Discussion & Analysis (MD&A), unless specified otherwise, are based on consolidated 
financial statements.2021 ReviewAs recovery is underway from the pandemic, the global economy witnessed a slight progress in 2021. World output edged up 6.1% 
year-on-year according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), partly attributable to base effect against 2020 when the global 
economy was seriously hit by the outbreak of pandemic. Thanks to the eased worldwide quarantine measures such as lockdowns 
and social distancing, trade and commerce resumed to get back on track, invigorating the total global trade volume. However, pos-
sibilities for resurgence in any Covid19 variants and a sharp rise in inflation still remain threats to world economy.Despite the global pandemic, the Korean economy showed a positive growth of 4.0% year-on-year. Overall consumption rose 4.2% 
year-on-year primarily due to a recovery in consumer confidence backed by government policy and expansion in vaccination. Infla-
tion rate for the year recorded 2.5% compared to 0.5% from last year. Current account surplus rose to USD 88.3billion in 2021 from 
USD 75.3billion in 2020, mostly due to increase in exports of services and income balance, in spite of goods balance showing a de-
cline ascribed to increase in imports resulted from surging prices of raw materials.The combined net income of the Korean banking industry in 2021 was KRW 16.9 trillion compared to KRW 12.1 trillion in 2020, 
based on preliminary figures published by the Financial Supervisory Service. This was partly attributable to KDB’s gains on valuation 
of equity which was converted from convertible bonds issued by HMM Co.,Ltd. With growing uncertainties about resurgence of 
Covid19 and a great portion of outstanding loan exposures to still-sluggish companies hit by economic downturn, banks in general 
adopted a more conservative approach in calculating their loan loss provisions.In 2021, KDB played a pivotal role in stabilizing the market as one of the key policy banks of Korea. The bank continuously strength-
ened financing for SMEs and MEs to bolster the resilience of Korea’s supply chains and assisted larger enterprises to reshape their 
businesses through “industry and finance alliance program”. The bank also extended special loan products especially designed to 
support companies adversely affected by the Covid19 crisis in order to mitigate the impact of Covid19 and ensure soft landing for 
SMEs and MEs in the post-Covid19 era.Moreover, KDB eminently stayed committed to its mandate to enhance the sustainable growth of Korea, serving as a threshold for 
innovative start-ups in Korea that are considered potentially flourished. Since its inauguration in 2016, the “KDB NextRound” con-
tinues to be a success as an investment platform linking promising start-ups with potential investors and venture capital companies 
at home and abroad. The bank further expanded on the investment platform by launching “NextRise” in 2019 , a start-up fair which 
gives opportunities to early-stage firms and individual entrepreneurs to attract investment from venture capitals and “KDB NextONE” 
in 2020, a platform for nurturing start-ups. In 2021, the bank especially focused on fostering system semiconductors, aerospace and 
ESG-related businesses in an effort to pave the new way for creating a potential as well as positive ecosystem in the future.The bank also continued its efforts to promote its overseas operations and strengthen IB business in the international markets. In 
2021, KDB has established a venture capital unit in Silicon Valley US, with a goal of supporting Korean start-ups operating in the U.S. 
and nurturing unicorns amid a prospering tech economy. The bank also consolidated its position in the international markets by ac-
tively identifying and participating in major PF transactions and providing M&A finance.KDB’s capacity as Korea’s representative financial institution and its strong capital adequacy have been evaluated and recognized by 
the major international credit rating agencies. In 2021, KDB maintained its credit ratings at Aa2 from Moody’s, AA from S&P and AA- 
from Fitch, and its BIS capital ratio stood at 14.88%.INTRODUCTIONBUSINESS REVIEWSUSTAINABILITY REVIEWFINANCIAL REVIEWAPPENDIX0780792022 OutlookThe impact of Covid19 pandemic is anticipated to diminish on the back of eased quarantine measures and widely-distributed vac-
cines across the globe in 2022. However, the possibility of higher inflationary pressure looms over the global economy and the lock-
down in some countries in the wake of Covid19 variants may eclipse signs of recovery in the real sector of the economy.According to the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (2022), world output is expected to increase by 3.6% year-on-year in 2022. The 
growth rate of advanced economies is projected to grow 3.3% from the previous year, with the US expecting to show a higher 
growth rate of 3.7% while Eurozone (2.8%) and Japan (2.4%) are projected to show a slower rate. Major emerging markets, such as 
India (+8.2%) and Saudi Arabia(+7.6%), are expected to show fast pace recoveries.The Bank of Korea’s forecast for Korea’s growth outlook is 3.0% while the IMF’s projection is 2.5%. Despite the uncertainties amid 
global economic climate, the Korean economy is forecast to show a modest recovery thanks mostly to eased quarantine rules and 
renewal of economic activity, but spike in energy and raw material prices stemming from geo-political issues could be an obstacle for 
soft landing on its economy. Such forecasts are subject to scrutiny since the resurgence of any Covid19 variant could still pose a po-
tential threat to the economy and drastic approaches to curb the inflationary pressure may unexpectedly contract the real economy.To tide over the challenges of 2022, KDB has set its business objective to be an “Advanced Policy Bank at the Forefront of Korea’s 
Sustainable Growth,” with a goal of boosting growth of new industries, steering fundamental changes in the country’s industrial 
structure for the future, as well as revitalizing the economy through Covid19 crisis management. In preparing for future economic 
transitions, the bank will usher in a low carbon economy by actively supporting the K-New Deal Policy (one of Korea government’s 
key initiatives on climate change) through launching public sector-led New Deal Funds and expanding green financing. The bank 
will also support innovative future industries by identifying and nurturing companies with creative potential and promoting a dynamic 
venture ecosystem within the country.On the threshold of heading into the post-Covid19 era, KDB will continue playing an integral role in green finance as part of effort to 
move Korea toward carbon neutrality, as well as establishing the foothold of innovative growth for Korean economy by facilitating ex-
isting venture platforms. In the meantime, the bank will prolong financial support programs to minimize companies’ default risk from 
rapid built up in their debt in the aftermath of the pandemic and provide tailored solutions to distressed companies and galvanize 
their recovery.Similar to last year, we are expecting a volatile and unpredictable financial landscape in 2022. As Korea’s leading policy bank, KDB 
will continue to carry out its market stabilization role based on its strong credit ratings, globally competitive financial expertise, and 
thorough risk management.Income AnalysisSummary Statement of IncomeNet operating revenue

(637.8)2,215.0294.9KDB recorded a net profit of KRW 1.3 trillion in 2021, KRW 0.6 trillion less than that in the previous year. Net operating revenue 
increased by KRW 0.9 trillion year-on-year. Due to the continuing trend of low interest rates, interest expenses decreased from last 
year and resulted in a 28.3% increase in the net interest income. Non-interest income also increased by 35.6% mainly due to an 
valuation on equity converted from convertible bonds of HMM that realized gains amounting to KRW 1.86 trillion. Operating income 
for year 2021 greatly increased by KRW 1.7 trillion. As a few restructuring cases including HJ Shipbuilding & Construction Co.,Ltd, K 
Shipbuilding Co., Ltd, etc., have culminated, there was a decrease in provision for credit loss year-on-year to KRW 492 billion relative 
to that of 2020. Non-operating income recorded a gain of KRW 725 billion compared to that of KRW 1,863 billion from the previous 
year. This was due to a sharp decrease in share of profit of investments in associates.Interest Income and NIMInterest-earning assets

0.32,924.2(322.4)As of end of 2021, KDB’s assets amounted to KRW 333,898 billion, up 9.5% compared to the previous year. This was mainly attrib-
utable to an increase in loan volumes and increase in valuation of securities held for sale. The increase in loan volumes reflected the 
bank's effort to overcome the Covid19 pandemic by providing more liquidity to the economy.KDB’s liabilities rose by 9.0% year-on-year to record KRW 287,740 billion, mainly attributable to increases in deposits and issuance 
of bonds. The deposit outstanding amounted to KRW 53,839 billion, increased by 14.6% compared to 2020 and bond outstanding 
amount stood at KRW 150,015 billion at year-end, up 4.7% year-on-year. KDB issued more bonds during the year to provide more 
liquidity amid the Covid19 crisis.KDB’s total equity stood at KRW 46,158 billion, up 12.6% compared to the previous year. During the year, KDB received capital in-
jection (KRW 1.1 trillion) from the government to execute the government’s various policy objectives including New Deal Policy, Cap-
ital Market Stabilization Program etc. The drastic increase in accumulated other comprehensive income is ascribed to increase in fair 
value of HMM’s perpetual bonds as securities measured at FVOCI.LoansCorporate loansLarge enterprises

NPLs decreased by 24.1% from the previous year, NPL Ratio fell from 2.48% in 2020 to 1.71% in 2021.Due to the Covid19 pandemic, KDB adopted a conservative approach in calculating its provision for credit loss. Thus, in 2021, loan 
loss reserve stood at KRW 4,598 billion, resulting in an increase of KRW 289 billion or 6.7%. As a result of the increase in loan loss 
reserve, the NPL coverage ratio rose by 49.04%p to 170.05%.Capital ManagementCapital Adequacy Ratio and Tier 1 RatioCapital adequacy ratio

ratios stood at 14.88% and 13.73%, down 1.08%p and 0.53%p each from the previous year. The decrease was mainly due to the 
increase in risk-weighted assets to KRW 299.7 trillion from KRW 252.6 trillion as of 2020, despite the fact that the bank's BIS capital 
recorded KRW 44.6 trillion showing an increase of KRW 4.3 trillion from the previous year, mainly due to increasing consolidated net 
income.Independent Auditors’ Report
Based on report originally issued in KoreanThe Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Korea Development BankOpinionWe have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Korea 
Development Bank and its subsidiaries ( collectively, the "Group"), which comprise the 
consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, 
and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated state-
ments of changes in equity and consolidated statements of cash flows for the years 
then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary 
of significant accounting policies.In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as of December 
31, 2021 and 2020, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated 
cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Re-
porting Standards as adopted by the Republic of Korea ("Korean IFRS").Basis for OpinionWe conducted our audit in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Respon-
sibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that 
are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the Republic of 
Korea, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.Emphasis of MatterWe draw attention to Note 2. (5) of the consolidated financial statements. As de-
scribed in Note 2. (5), the pandemic of Covid19 in 2021 has a negative impact on the 
global economy and may have negative impacts on the financial position and finan-
cial performance of the Group. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.Other MatterAuditing standards and their application in practice vary among countries. The proce-
dures and practices used in the Republic of Korea to audit such financial statements 
may differ from those generally accepted and applied in other countries.Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the 
Consolidated Financial StatementsManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consol-
idated financial statements in accordance with Korean IFRS, and for such internal 
control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consol-
idated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for 
assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations.Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group's financial 
reporting process.Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial StatementsOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing will always detect a material mis-
statement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are con-
sidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidat-
ed financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing, we exercise pro-
fessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated finan-
cial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit proce-
dures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonablenessof accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated finan-
cial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of 
the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the con-
solidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other mat-
ters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, includ-
ing any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.Seoul, Korea 
March 29, 2022This report is effective as of March 29, 2022, the audit report date. Certain subsequent events or circumstances, which may occur between the audit report date and the time 
of reading this report, could have a material impact on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Accordingly, the readers of the audit report

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 
2.     Basis of Preparation(1) Application of accounting standards 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Korean International Financial 
Reporting Standards (K-IFRS) enacted by the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies. 
 
(2) Changes and disclosures of accounting policies 
(i) New and amended standards and interpretations adopted 
The Group newly applied the following amended and enacted standards for the annual period beginning on January 
1, 2021. The nature and the impact of each new standard or amendment are described below: 
 
Amendments  to  K-IFRS  1109  ‘Financial  Instruments’,  K-IFRS  1039  ‘Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and 
Measurement’, K-IFRS 1107 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure’, K-IFRS 1104 ‘Insurance Contracts’ and K-IFRS 
1116 ‘Lease’ – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform 
In relation to interest rate benchmark reform, the amendments provide a practical expedient allowing entities to 
change the effective interest rate instead of changing the carrying amount and apply hedge accounting without 
discontinuance although the interest rate benchmark is replaced in hedging relationship. The amendment does not 
have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.(ii) New standards and interpretations issued but not effective 
The  following  new  standards,  interpretations  and  amendments  to  existing  standards  have  been  issued  but  not 
effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2021, and the Group has not early adopted them. The Group 
is currently in progress of analyzing the potential impact on the financial statements resulting from the application 
of these standards, interpretations and amendments. 
 
Amendments to K-IFRS 1103 ‘Business Combinations’– Reference to the Conceptual Framework  
The  amendments  update  a  reference  of  definition  of  assets  and  liabilities  to  qualify  for  recognition  in  revised 
Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. However, the amendments add an exception for the recognition of 
liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities  within  the  scope  of  K-IFRS  1037  ‘Provisions,  Contingent  Liabilities  and 
Contingent Assets’, and K-IFRS 2121 ‘Levies’. The amendments also confirm that contingent assets should not be 
recognized at the acquisition date. The amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2022, and earlier application is permitted. The Group does not expect that these amendments have a 
significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
 
Amendments to K-IFRS 1016 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ - Proceeds before intended use 
The amendments prohibit an entity from deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any 
proceeds from selling items produced while the entity is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, the entity 
will recognize and disclose the proceeds from selling such items, and the costs of producing those items, as profit 
or loss. The amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022, and earlier 
application  is  permitted.  The  Group  does  not  expect  that  these  amendments  have  a  significant  impact  on  the 
consolidated financial statements. 
 
Amendments to K-IFRS 1037 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’ – Onerous Contracts: Cost 
of Fulfilling a Contract 
The amendments clarify that the direct costs of fulfilling a contract include both the incremental costs of fulfilling 
the contract and an allocation of other costs directly related to fulfilling contracts when assessing whether the 
contract is onerous. The amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022, 
and earlier application is permitted. The Group does not expect that these amendments have a significant impact on 
the consolidated financial statements. 
 
Amendments to K-IFRS 1001 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ - Classification of Liabilities as Current or 
Non-current 
The amendments clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, depending on the substantive 
rights that exist at the end of the reporting period. Classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will 
exercise right to defer settlement of the liability or the management’s expectations thereof. Also, the settlement of 
liability includes the transfer of the entity’s own equity instruments; however, it would be excluded if an option to 
settle the liability by the transfer of the entity’s own equity instruments is recognized separately from the liability 
as an equity component of a compound financial instrument. The amendments should be applied for annual periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and earlier application is permitted. The Group does not expect that these 
amendments have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.16Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

2.     Basis of Preparation, Continued(iii) Deferred taxes 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset 
is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date. Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that sufficient taxable profit will be 
available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Actual income taxes in the future may not be 
identical to the recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
 
 (iv) Defined benefit liabilities 
The Group operates a defined benefit plan. Defined benefit liability is calculated by annual actuarial valuations as 
of the reporting date. In order to perform the actuarial valuations, assumptions for discount rates, future salary 
increases  and  others  are  required  to  be  estimated.  Defined  benefit  plans  contain  significant  uncertainties  in 
estimations due to its long-term nature.

2.     Basis of Preparation, Continued(5) Use of estimates and judgments 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with K-IFRS requires management to make 
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts 
of  assets,  liabilities,  income  and  expenses.  Management’s  estimates  may  differ  from  actual  outcomes  if 
management’s estimates and assumptions based on management’s best judgment at the reporting date are different 
from the actual environment.  
 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.  
 
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
end of the reporting period that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:  
 
(i) Fair value of financial instruments 
Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss and other comprehensive income, and derivative 
instruments are recognized and measured at fair value. If the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair 
value is determined either by using a valuation technique or independent third-party valuation service. Valuation 
techniques  include  using  recent  arm's  length  market  transactions  between  knowledgeable,  willing  parties,  if 
available, referencing to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash 
flow analysis and option pricing models.Financial instruments, which are not actively traded in the market and those with less transparent market prices, 
will have less objective fair values and require broad judgment on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty in market 
factors and assumptions in price determination and other risks.  
 
Diverse valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, from generally accepted 
market valuation models to internally developed valuation models that incorporate various types of assumptions 
and variables.(ii) Credit losses allowance 
The Group tests impairment and recognizes loss allowances on financial assets classified at amortized cost, debt 
instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and recognizes provisions for payment 
guarantee, financial guarantee and unused commitments. Accuracy of allowances and provisions for credit losses 
is dependent upon estimation of expected cash flows of the borrower for individually assessed allowances of loans, 
and upon assumptions and methodology used for collectively assessed allowances for groups of loans, guarantees 
and unused loan commitments. 
 
The  pandemic  of  COVID-19  in  2021  has  a  negative  impact  on  the  global  economy  despite  of  the  Korean 
government’s financial and economic stabilization packages. It may have a negative impact on the financial position 
and financial performance of the Group due to the increase of the expected credit losses on specific portfolios and 
the potential losses on financial assets. The detail of credit risk exposures by industry affected by the pandemic of 
COVID-19 as of December 31, 2021 is disclosed in Note 53. (2) and the exposures by industries could be changed 
according to economic fluctuations. 
 
Taking these circumstances into account comprehensively, the Group recalculated the forward-looking information 
used to estimate the expected credit loss in accordance with K-IFRS 1109 'Financial Instruments' as at December 
31, 2021. During the twelve-month period since the end of the previous year, there have been changes in the 
forward-looking information that affects expected credit losses, and it is predicted that major economic factors such 
as the 2021 unemployment rate and economic growth rate will deteriorate due to the impact of COVID-19. To 
reflect  these  changes,  the  Group  recalculated  the  forward-looking  information  by  means  of  increasing  the 
probability of recession used in generating future economic scenarios and will continue to monitor the forward-
looking information on a quarterly basis.The significant accounting policies applied by the Group in preparation of its consolidated financial statements are 
included below. The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in 
these consolidated financial statements.(1) Basis of consolidation 
(i) Subsidiaries and business combinations 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has right 
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
of the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the 
date on which control commences until the date on which controls ceases.If  a  subsidiary  of  the  Group  uses  accounting  policies  other  than  those  adopted  in  the  consolidated  financial 
statements  for  like  transactions  and  events  in  similar  circumstances,  appropriate  adjustments  are  made  to  its 
financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements.For acquisitions meeting the definition of a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting is used.  
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Any goodwill arising from initial consolidation is tested for 
impairment at least once a year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for impairment. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition 
date in fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed and the 
amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquire. Costs related to acquisition are recognized as expenses when 
occurred.The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired 
is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets 
acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.Intra-group  balances,  income  and  expenses,  unrealized  gain  and  loss  and  dividends  resulting  from  intra-group 
transactions are fully eliminatedA change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a change of control, is accounted for as an equity 
transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it recognizes any investment retained at fair value and any 
surplus or deficit in profit or loss.1920Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 
3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(ii) Investments in associates 
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Significant influence is 
presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power. Investments in associates are 
accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognized at cost. The Group’s investment in 
associates  includes  goodwill  (net  of  any  accumulated  impairment  loss)  identified  on  acquisition.  When  the 
investors’ share on the fair value of the associates’ identifiable assets and liabilities exceeds acquisition cost of the 
associates’ interest, the excess portion is recognized as the current profit for the year of acquisition.The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or loss is recognized in the statement of comprehensive 
income, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognized in reserves. When the Group’s share 
of loss in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the 
Group  does  not  recognize  further  loss,  unless  it  has  incurred  obligations  or  made  payments  on  behalf  of  the 
associates. The carrying amount of equity method investments and the long-term interest that partially consists of 
investors’ net investment are included in interest in the associate.Unrealized gain and loss on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the associate. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.(iii) Acquisitions from entities under common control 
The  assets  and  liabilities  acquired  are  recognized  at  the  carrying  amounts  recognized  previously  in  the  Group 
controlling shareholder’s consolidated financial statements. The difference between cash paid and acquired net 
assets are recorded in equity.(iv) Non-controlling interests 
Non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are accounted for separately from the parent’s ownership interests in a 
subsidiary. Each component of net profit or loss and other comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the 
parent and non-controlling interest holders, even when the allocation reduces the non-controlling interests balance 
below zero.  
 
(v) Changes in the parent company’s ownership interest  
Changes  in  the  parent company’s ownership  interest  in  a  subsidiary  that  do not result  in  a  loss  of  control  are 
accounted  for  as  equity  transactions  with  owners  in  their  capacity  as  owners.  Adjustments  to  non-controlling 
interests  are  based  on  a  proportionate  amount  of  the  net  assets  of  the  subsidiary.  The  difference  between  the 
consideration and the adjustments made to non-controlling interests is recognized directly in equity attributable to 
the owners of the parent company.  
 
(2) Operating segments 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn 
revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s 
other components. Segment results that are reported to the chief operating decision maker include items directly 
attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items mainly 
comprise corporate assets (primarily the Group’s headquarters), head office expenses, and income tax assets and 
liabilities. The Group recognizes the CEO as the chief operating decision maker.102103Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(3) Foreign exchange 
(i) Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of company entities at exchange rates at 
the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date 
are  translated  to  the  functional  currency  at  the  exchange  rate  at  that  date.  Non-monetary  assets  and  liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currency at the 
exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognized in profit or loss, except for differences arising on 
the  translation  of  available  for  sale  equity  instruments,  a  financial  liability  designated  as  a  hedge  of  the  net 
investment in a foreign operation, or in a qualifying cash flow hedge, which are recognized in other comprehensive 
income. Exchange rate effect of the gain (or loss) from non-monetary item is categorized according to whether the 
gain (or loss) is recognized as other comprehensive income or as profit or loss.  
 
(ii) Foreign operations 
If the presentation currency of the Group is different from a foreign operation’s functional currency, the financial 
statements of the foreign operation are translated into the presentation currency using the following methods: 
 
Unless the functional currency of foreign operations is in a state of hyperinflation, assets and liabilities of foreign 
operations are translated at the closing exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses on 
the statement of comprehensive income are translated at the exchange rates of the date of transaction. Foreign 
currency differences that arise from translation are recognized as other comprehensive income.Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation, and any adjustments in fair value to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities due to such acquisition, are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation. 
Therefore, such are expressed in the functional currency of the foreign operations and, alongside other assets and 
liabilities of the foreign operation, translated at the closing exchange rate.  
 
In the case of the disposal of a foreign operation, cumulative amounts of exchange difference regarding the foreign 
operation, recognized separately from other comprehensive income, are re-categorized from assets to profit or loss 
as of the moment the disposal profit or loss is recognized.  
 
(iii) Foreign exchange of net investment in foreign operations 
Monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, with none or little possibility of being settled in 
the foreseeable future, are considered a part of the net investment in the foreign operation. Therefore, the exchange 
difference is recognized as comprehensive income or loss in the consolidated financial statement, and re-categorized 
to profit or loss as of the disposal of the related net investment.2223Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(4) Recognition and measurement of financial instruments 
(i) Initial recognition 
The Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability in its consolidated statement of financial position 
when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A regular way purchase or sale of 
financial assets is recognized and derecognized using trade date accounting. 
 
The Group classifies financial assets as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets at fair 
value through other comprehensive income, or financial assets at amortized cost on the basis of the Group’s business 
model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. The 
Group classifies financial liabilities as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, or financial liabilities 
at amortized cost. 
 
At initial recognition, a financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case 
of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability. 
 
(ii) Subsequent measurement 
After initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at amortized cost or fair value based on classification 
at initial recognition. 
 
Amortized cost 
The amortized cost is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition 
minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of 
any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any loss 
allowance. 
 
Fair value 
Fair values, which the Group primarily uses for the measurement of financial instruments, are the published price 
quotations based on market prices or dealer price quotations of financial instruments traded in an active market 
where available. These are the best evidence of fair value. A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active 
market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, an entity in the same 
industry, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market 
transactions on an arm's length basis. 
 
If the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is determined either by using a valuation technique 
or  independent  third-party  valuation  service.  Valuation  techniques  include  using  recent  arm's  length  market 
transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, if available, referencing to the current fair value of another 
instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.104105Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 
3.      Significant Accounting Policies, ContinuedThe Group uses valuation models that are commonly used by market participants and customized for the Group to 
determine  fair  values  of  common  over-the-counter  (OTC)  derivatives  such  as  options,  interest  rate  swaps  and 
currency swaps which are based on the inputs observable in markets. For more complex instruments, the Group 
uses internally developed models, which are usually based on valuation methods and techniques generally used 
within the industry, or a value measured by an independent external valuation institution as the fair values if all or 
some of the inputs to the valuation models are not market observable and therefore it is necessary to estimate fair 
value based on certain assumptions. 
 
If the valuation technique does not reflect all factors which market participants would consider in setting a price, 
the fair value is adjusted to reflect those factors. Those factors include counterparty credit risk, bid-ask spread, 
liquidity risk and others. 
 
The chosen valuation technique makes maximum use of market inputs and relies as little as possible on entity-
specific inputs. It incorporates all factors that market participants would consider in setting a price and is consistent 
with  economic  methodologies  applied  for  pricing  financial  instruments.  Periodically,  the  Group  calibrates  the 
valuation  technique  and  tests  its  validity  using  prices  of  observable  current  market  transactions  of  the  same 
instrument or based on other relevant observable market data. 
 
(iii) Derecognition 
Derecognition is the removal of a previously recognized financial asset or financial liability from the statement of 
financial position. The Group derecognizes a financial asset or a financial liability when, and only when: 
 
Derecognition of financial assets 
Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or 
the financial assets have been transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial 
assets are also transferred, or all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are neither substantially 
transferred nor retained and the Group has not retained control. If the Group neither transfers nor disposes of 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets, the Group continues to recognize the 
financial asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the financial asset. 
 
If the Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but retains substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset 
in its entirety and recognize a financial liability for the consideration received. 
 
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are derecognized from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the 
contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
 
(iv) Offsetting 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated statements of financial 
position where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle 
on a net basis or realize the assets and settle the liability simultaneously. 
 
(5) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with original maturities of three months or less than three months’ 
maturity from the date of acquisition that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, including 
cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities 
of three months or less.2425Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 
3.      Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(6) Non-derivative financial assets 
(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Any non-derivative financial asset classified as held for trading or not classified as financial assets at fair value 
through other comprehensive income or financial assets measured at amortized cost is categorized under financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
The Group may designate certain financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss when 
the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred 
to as 'an accounting mismatch') that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the 
gains and losses on them on different bases. 
 
 
After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is measured at fair value and gains or 
losses arising from a change in the fair value are recognized in profit or loss. Interest income and dividend income 
from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are also recognized in profit or loss. 
 
(ii) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 
The Group classifies financial assets as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income if they 
meet the following conditions: 1) debt instruments that are a business model whose objective is achieved by both 
collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and consistent with representing solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding or 2) equity instruments, not held for trading with the 
objective of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealer’s margin, designated as financial 
assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. 
 
After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income is measured at fair 
value. Gain and loss from changes in fair value, other than dividend income and interest income amortized using 
effective interest method and exchange differences arising on monetary items which are recognized directly in 
income as interest income or expense, are recognized as other comprehensive income in equity. 
 
At  disposal  of  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income,  cumulative  gain  or  loss  is 
recognized  as  profit  or  loss  for  the  reporting  period.  However,  cumulative  gain  or  loss  of  equity  instrument 
designated as fair value through other comprehensive income are not recycled to profit or loss at disposal. 
 
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
at the closing rate. Exchange differences resulting from changes in amortized cost are recognized in profit or loss, 
and other changes are recognized as equity. 
 
(iii) Financial assets measured at amortized cost 
A financial asset, which are held within the business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows and consistent with representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding, are classified as a financial asset at amortized cost. Financial assets at amortized cost are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method after initial recognition and interest 
income is recognized using the effective interest method.106107Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

3.      Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(7) Expected Credit Loss of Financial Assets 
The Group measures expected credit loss and recognizes loss allowance at the end of the reporting period for 
financial assets measured at amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income with the exception 
of financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
The expected credit loss (“ECL”) is the weighted average amount of possible outcomes within a certain range, 
reflecting the time value of money, estimates on the past, current and future situations, and information accessible 
without excessive cost of effort. 
 
The Group uses the following three measurement techniques in accordance with K-IFRS: 
-  General approach: for financial assets and off-balance-sheet unused credit line that are not applied below twoapproaches-  Simplified approach: for receivables, contract assets and lease receivables 
-  Credit-impaired approach: for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets 
 
The general approach is applied differently depending on the significance of the increase of the credit risk. If, at the 
reporting date, the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, an 
entity shall measure the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit 
losses. If the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, an entity 
shall measure the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses 
at each reporting date. 
 
The Group applies the simplified approach to 1) trade receivables and contract assets that do not have a significant 
financing component or 2) trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables upon determining the Group’s 
accounting policies as the application of the simplified approach. The approach requires expected lifetime losses to 
be recognized from initial recognition of the financial assets. Under credit-impaired approach, the Group shall only 
recognize the cumulative changes in lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition as a loss allowance for 
purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets. 
 
The following non-exhaustive list of information may be relevant in assessing changes in credit risk: 
- 
 Significant changes in internal price indicators of credit risk as a result of a change in credit risk since inception 
-  Other changes in the rates or terms of an existing financial instrument that would be significantly different if theinstrument was newly originated or issued at the reporting date 
 An actual or expected significant change in the financial instrument’s external credit rating. 
 An actual or expected internal credit rating downgrade for the borrower or decrease in behavioural scoring used 
to assess credit risk internally 
 An actual or expected significant change in the operating results of the borrower 
 Past due information- 
- 
 
(i) Forward-looking information 
The Group uses forward-looking information, when it determines whether the credit risk has increased significantly 
since initial recognition and measures expected credit losses. 
 
The Group assumes the risk component has a certain correlation with the business cycle, and calculates the expected 
credit loss by reflecting the forward-looking information with macroeconomic variables on the measurement inputs. 
 
Forward  looking  information  used  in  calculation  of  expected  credit  loss  is  derived  after  comprehensive 
consideration of a variety of factors including scenario in management planning, worst-case scenario used for stress 
testing, third party forecast, and others.-

3.      Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(ii) Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at amortized cost 
The amount of the loss on financial assets at amortized cost is measured as the difference between the asset's 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original 
effective interest rate. The Group estimates expected future cash flows for financial assets that are individually 
significant (individual assessment of impairment). 
 
For financial assets that are not individually significant, the Group collectively estimates expected credit loss by 
grouping loans with homogeneous credit risk profile (collective assessment of impairment). 
 
Individual assessment of impairment 
Individual assessment of impairment losses is calculated using management's best estimate on present value of 
expected  future  cashflows.  The  Group  uses  all  the  available  information  including  operating  cash  flow  of  the 
borrower and net realizable value of any collateral held. 
 
Collective assessment of impairment 
Collective assessment of loss allowance involves historical loss experience along with incorporation of forward-
looking information. Such process incorporates factors such as type of collateral, product and borrowers, credit 
rating, size of portfolio and recovery period and applies probability of default on a group of assets and loss given 
default by type of recovery method. Also, the expected credit loss model involves certain assumption to determine 
input based on loss experience and forward-looking information. These models and assumptions are periodically 
reviewed to reduce gap between loss estimate and actual loss experience. 
 
The expected credit loss for financial assets measured at amortized cost is recognized as the loss allowance, and 
when the financial asset is determined to be irrecoverable, the carrying amount and loss allowance are decreased. 
If  financial  assets  previously  written  off  are  recovered,  the  loss  allowance  is  increased  and  the  difference  is 
recognized in the current profit or loss. 
 
(iii) Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 
Measuring method of expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 
is equal to the method of financial assets at amortized cost, except for changes in loss allowances that are recognized 
as other comprehensive income. Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income for sale or repayment of 
financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.108109Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(8) Derivative financial instruments including hedge accounting 
Derivative  financial  instruments  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  upon  agreement  of  the  contract  and  re-
estimated at fair value subsequently. The recognition of profit or loss due to changes in fair value of derivative 
instruments is as stated below:(i) Hedge accounting 
Derivative financial instruments are accounted differently depending on whether hedge accounting is applied, and 
therefore, are classified into trading purpose derivatives and hedging purpose derivatives.  
Upon the transaction of hedging purpose derivatives, two different types of hedge accounting are applied; a fair 
value hedge, and a cash flow hedge. A fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a 
recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability 
or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss. A cash flow hedge is a 
hedge  of  the  exposure  to  variability  in  cash  flows  that  (i)  is  attributable  to  a  particular  risk  associated  with  a 
recognised asset or liability (such as all or some future interest payments on variable rate debt) or a highly probable 
forecast transaction and (ii) could affect profit or loss. 
 
At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedged item and 
the hedging instrument, including the nature of the risk, the objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, and 
the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship.Fair value hedge 
For designated and qualifying fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of a hedging derivative is recognised 
in profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. Meanwhile, the change in the fair value of the hedged 
item,  attributable  to  the  risk  hedged,  is  recorded  as  part  of  the  carrying  value  of  the  hedged  item  and  is  also 
recognised in profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. When the hedge no longer meets the criteria 
for  hedge  accounting,  the  hedge  relationship  is  terminated.  For  hedged  item  recorded  at  amortized  cost,  the 
difference between the carrying value of the hedged item on termination and the face value is amortized over the 
remaining term of the original hedge using the EIR.Cash flow hedge 
For designated and qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of gain or loss on the hedging instruments is 
initially recognised directly in equity. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is 
recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. When the hedged cash flow affects the profit 
or  loss  in  statement  of  comprehensive  income,  the  gain  or  loss  on  the  hedging  instrument  is  recorded  in  the 
corresponding income or expense line in profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. When a hedge 
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains 
in equity and is recognised when the hedged forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain and loss 
that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income.Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
The Group designates non-derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments for foreign currency risk arising 
from net investments in foreign operations and recognises the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
that is determined to be an effective hedge in other comprehensive income. The cumulative amounts recognised in 
other comprehensive income relating to both the foreign exchange differences arising on translation of the results 
and financial position of the foreign operation and the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to 
be an effective hedge of the net investment are reclassed from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment 
when the Group disposes of the foreign operation.(ii) Trading purpose derivatives 
For trading purpose derivatives transaction, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in net income.(9) Day one profit or loss recognition 
For financial instruments classified as level 3 on the fair value level hierarchy measured using assess variables not 
observable in the market, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price, which 
is equivalent to Day one profit or loss, is amortized by using the straight-line method over time.2829Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(10) Property and equipment 
The Group’s property and equipment is recognized at the carrying amount as historical costs less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment in value. Historical costs include the expenditures directly related to the 
acquisition of assets.  
 
Subsequent  costs  are  recognized  in  the  carrying  amount  of  assets  or,  if  appropriate,  as  separate  assets  if  the 
probabilities future economic benefits associated with the assets will flow into the Group and the costs can be 
measured reliably; the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. Furthermore, any other repairs or 
maintenances are charged to profit or loss as incurred.  
 
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method to the amount of 
residual value less acquisition cost over the following estimated useful lives:TypeUseful lives (years)Buildings

assesses  residual  value  and  economic  life  of  its  assets  at  each  reporting  date  and  adjusts  its  useful  life  when 
necessary. Any gain or loss arising from the disposal of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is recognized in non-operating income (expense) in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income.110111Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

10 ~ 40(11) Investment property 
The  Group  classifies  property  held  for  the  purpose  of  rental  income  or  benefits  from  capital  appreciation  as 
investment property. Investment property is measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, the cost model is applied. Subsequent to initial recognition, an item of investment property is 
carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss.  
 
Investment properties are derecognized either when they have been disposed of or when the investment property is 
permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. The difference 
between  the  net  disposal  proceeds  and  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  is  recognized  in  the  statement  of 
comprehensive income in the period of de-recognition. Reclassification to or from other account is made if there is 
a change in use of corresponding investment property.  
 
Depreciation of investment property is calculated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives as 
follows:(12) Intangible assets 
An intangible asset is recognized only when its cost can be measured reliably, and the probabilities future economic 
benefits from the asset will flow into the Group are high. Separately acquired intangible assets are recognized at the 
acquisition  cost,  and  subsequently,  the  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated  impairment  is 
recognized as the carrying amount.  
 
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the 4-year to 30-year period of useful economic lives using the 
straight line method. At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews intangible assets for any evidence that 
indicate impairment, and upon the presence of such evidence, the Group estimates the amount recoverable and 
recognizes the loss accordingly. Intangible assets are derecognized either when they have been disposed of or when 
the intangible assets are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its 
disposal.  
  
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually. Furthermore, 
the Group reviews such intangible assets to determine whether it is appropriate to consider these assets to have 
indefinite useful lives. If in the case the Group concludes an asset is not qualified to be classified as non-finite, 
prospective measures are taken to consider such an asset as finite.  
 
Expenditures on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge 
and understanding, are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Development expenditures are capitalized only if 
development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future 
economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and 
to use or sell the asset. Other development expenditures are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.3031Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(13) Leases 
(i) Lessee accounting 
The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability 
representing its obligation to make lease payments at the commencement date of the lease. The Group elected not 
to apply the requirements to the short-term leases and low value assets. 
 
Right-of-use asset 
The right-of-use asset is measured at its cost less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
loss with adjustments reflected arising from remeasurements of the lease liability. The cost of the right-of-use asset 
comprise the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee 
and any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentive received. The right-of-
use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis from the 
commencement date of the lease. 
 
Lease liabilities 
At the commencement date, the lease liability is measured at present value of the lease payments that are not paid 
at  that  date.  Lease  payments  include  fixed  payments  (including  in-substance  fixed  payments),  less  any  lease 
incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be payable 
by the lessee under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably 
certain to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the 
lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a 
rate are recognized as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs. 
 
When measuring the present value, the lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If 
such implicit rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease 
liability is subsequently increased by the amount of interest expenses recognized on the lease liability and reduced 
by the lease payments made. 
 
Lease liabilities are remeasured when the future lease payments are changed due to the following: 
-  Changes in an index or a rate; 
-  Changes in amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; 
-  Changes  in  the  assessment  of  whether  a  purchase  option  or  an  option  to  renew  is  reasonably  certain  to  beexercised; orexercised.-  Changes in the assessment of whether it is reasonably certain that an option to terminate the lease will not beLeases of low-value assets and short-term leases 
The Group applies the recognition exemption for leases of low-value assets (e.g., office supplies and IT equipment) 
and short-term leases (i.e., leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). In these cases, lease payments are charged 
to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of lease.112113Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 
3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(ii) Lessor accounting 
The classification of leases is based on the extent to which risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased 
asset lie with the lessor. 
 
Finance lease 
Leases of assets where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases, and the Group presents them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Also, 
initial  direct  cost  that  includes  directly  and  additionally  incurred  commission  fee,  legal  expenses,  and  internal 
accrued costs are included in finance lease receivables. The Group accounts for lease payment by apportioning into 
finance  lease  receivables  and  interest  revenue,  and  interest  revenue  is  recognized  using  the  EIR  method  on 
uncollected finance lease net investment.Operating lease 
A lease is classified as operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership,  and  the  related  asset  is  presented  as  acquisition  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation.  Moreover,  the 
minimum lease payment excluding guaranteed residual value is recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over 
the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred by lessors in negotiating and arranging an operating lease shall be added 
to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized as an expense over the lease term, and the depreciation 
policy for depreciable leased assets shall be consistent with the lessors’ normal depreciation policy for similar 
assets. 
 
(14) Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Group tests for any evidence of impairment in assets and reviews whether the impairment has taken place by 
estimating the recoverable amount, at the end of each reporting period. The Group estimates the recoverable amount 
of each asset or a whole cash-generating unit unless it is possible to estimate the amount of the asset in that unit. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost and value in use, of an asset. The Group recognizes 
the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount of the asset as an impairment loss if the 
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.  
 
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business is allocated to each cash-generating unit that is expected to 
gain the benefits of the synergy effect. Impairment on cash-generating unit deducts other assets in proportion to 
their carrying amounts after deducting the carrying amount of goodwill allocated in that unit. Impairment loss on 
goodwill cannot be reversed once it is recognized.  
 
Except for impairment losses in respect of goodwill that are never reversed, an impairment loss is reversed if there 
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The reversal is limited so that the 
carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceeds the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.3233Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 
3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(15) Assets held for sale 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through 
continuing use, are classified as held for sale. In order to be classified as held for sale, the asset (or disposal groups) 
must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable. The assets (or 
disposal groups) that are classified as assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and 
fair value less cost to sell.  
 
The Group recognizes an impairment loss for any initial or subsequent write-down of an asset (or disposal groups) 
to fair value less costs to sell, and a gain for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell, up to the 
cumulative impairment loss previously recognized.  
 
Non-current assets that are classified as held for sale or part of a disposal group classified as held for sale are not 
depreciated (or amortized).  
 
(16) Non-derivative financial liabilities 
The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
or other financial liabilities in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of 
financial liability. The Group recognizes these financial liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position 
when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial liability.(i) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in the current year include financial liabilities held for trading 
and  financial  liabilities  designated  at  FVTPL  upon  initial  recognition.  Financial  liabilities  and  derivatives  are 
classified as financial instruments held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of repurchasing in the near 
future. Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at FVTPL upon initial recognition, if the profit or 
loss  from  the  liabilities  indicates  to  be  more  purpose-appropriate  to  be  recognized  as  profit  or  loss.  Financial 
liabilities at FVTPL are designated at fair value in subsequent measurements, and any related un-realized profit or 
loss is recognized as profit or loss.114115Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 
3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(ii) Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost 
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are recognized at fair value less cost less transaction cost upon initial 
recognition, and subsequently at amortized costs. The difference between the proceeds (net of transaction cost) and 
the redemption value is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income over the periods of the liabilities 
using the EIR.  
 
Fees paid on the establishment of a loan facility are recognized as transaction costs of the loan, if the probability 
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down is high. The amount is deferred until the financial liability would 
be withdrawn. If, however, there is not enough evidence to conclude a draw-down of some or all of the facility will 
occur, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortized over the period of the facility to 
which it relates.(iii) De-recognition of financial liabilities 
A financial liability is de-recognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or 
the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-
recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value 
of the original financial liability and the consideration paid is recognized in profit or loss. 
 
(17) Employee benefits 
(i) Short-term employee benefits 
Short-term employee benefits are employee benefits that are due to be settled wholly before 12 months after the 
end of the reporting period in which the employees render the related service. When an employee has rendered 
service to the Group during an accounting period, the Group recognizes the undiscounted amount of short-term 
employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service.  
 
(ii) Retirement benefits: defined contribution plans 
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund. 
The Group is no longer responsible for any foreseeable future liability after a certain amount or percentage of money 
is set aside for defined contribution plans. If the pension plan allows for early retirement, payments are recognized 
as employee benefits. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for service before the end of the 
reporting period, the Group recognizes that excess as an asset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a 
reduction in future payments or a cash refund.(iii) Retirement benefits: defined benefit plans 
The Group classifies all the pensions as defined benefit plans except defined contribution plans. The Group’s net 
obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. 
The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit 
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future 
cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the 
benefits will be paid, and have terms to maturity similar to the terms of the related pension liability.Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liabilities (assets), which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return 
on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognized 
immediately in other comprehensive income.3435Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(18) Provisions 
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
 
(19) Financial guarantees 
Financial  guarantee  contracts  are  contracts  that  require  the  issuer  (the  Group)  to  make  specified  payments  to 
reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance 
with the original or changed terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantees are initially recognized in the financial 
statements at fair value on the date the guarantee was given.  
 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group’s liabilities under such guarantees are measured at the higher of: 
 
-  The amount determined in accordance with K-IFRS 1109 ‘Financial Instruments’ and  
-  The initial amount recognized, less, when appropriate, cumulative amortization recognized in accordance withK-IFRS 1115 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’.(20) Securities under resale or repurchase agreements 
Securities purchased under agreements to resell are recorded as other loans and receivables and the related interest 
from these securities is recorded as interest income; Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are recorded as 
borrowings, and the related interest from these securities is recorded as interest expense.  
 
(21) Policy reserves for insurance contracts 
In accordance with the Insurance Business Act and related insurance standards, the Group is required to maintain 
policy reserves, which consist of premium reserve, unearned premium reserve, reserve for outstanding claims, 
reserve for participating policyholders’ dividends, excess participating policyholders’ dividend reserve and reserve 
for loss on participating insurance policies, as a liability which is measured in accordance with the Manual for 
Calculation of Premium and Policy Reserves as approved by the Financial Supervisory Commission. Details are as 
follows:(i) Premium reserve 
Premium reserve represents an amount calculated based on a net premium valuation, which is the greater of an 
amount calculated by using the standard interest rate and standard risk rate issued by the Financial Supervisory 
Service (FSS), and an amount calculated using an internally generated rate derived by the Group. If the reserve is 
at zero or less, the amount is to be recorded at nil.(ii) Unearned premium reserve 
Unearned premium reserve represents an amount allocated for certain premiums whose initial payment date falls 
within the current reporting period and future payments, if any, fall subsequent to the end of the reporting period.(iii) Guaranteed benefit reserve 
Guaranteed benefit reserve guarantees a certain level of the insurance claims considering expected loss in the future. 
The Group’s guaranteed benefit reserve consists of the following:-  Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit: reserves that guarantee financial resources for the pension benefitamount that equals to the predetermined value in the contract.-  Guaranteed  minimum  death  benefit:  reserves  that  guarantee  death  benefit  amount  that  equals  to  thepredetermined value in the contract.-  Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit: reserves that guarantee the interim withdrawals amount that equals tothe predetermined value in the contract during the period for interim withdrawals.-  Guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit: reserves that guarantee the interim withdrawals amount that equals tothe predetermined value in the contract during lifetime.-  Other guaranteed benefits: guaranteed benefit reserves other than those listed above for a guarantee of insuranceproceeds in excess of a certain level.36116117Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(iv) Reserve for outstanding claims 
Reserve for outstanding claims represents a reserve based on estimate of loss for insured events that have occurred 
prior to the reporting date but have not yet been settled or determined, including:-  Outstanding losses: losses that have been reported to the insurer but are still in the process of settlement (in caseswhere a claim is partially paid, the remnant is reported).-  Incurred but not reported (IBNR): an estimate of the amount based on historical information of an insurer’sliability for claim-generating events that have taken place but have not yet been reported to the insurer.-  Reserve for lapsed insurance contracts: reserve for insurance cancellation refund for lapsed insurance contractsdue to non-payment of insurance premium that still can be revived or deferred within a certain period.-  Outstanding claims: legitimate claims, such as compensation, refund, dividend that an insurer has not yet paidto policy holder.(v) Reserve for participating policyholders’ dividends 
The reserve for participating policyholders’ dividends is classified into interest dividend reserve, mortality dividend 
reserve, interest rate difference guarantee reserve and long-term duration dividend reserve.(vi) Excess participating policyholders’ dividend reserve 
Pursuant  to relevant  laws  and  contracts,  the  Group  may provide  an  excess  participating  policyholder  dividend 
reserve based on the operating results of related insurance products. The reserve may be used to pay participating 
policyholder dividends or additional dividends.(22) Equity 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares 
and share options are recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.  
 
When the Group repurchases its share capital, the amount of the consideration paid is recognized as a deduction 
from equity and classified as treasury shares. The profits or loss from the purchase, disposal, reissue, or retirement 
of treasury shares are not recognized as current profit or loss. If the Group acquires and retains treasury shares, the 
consideration paid or received is directly recognized in equity.Non–controlling interests refer to equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Non- 
controlling  interests  consist  of  the  minority  interest  net  income  calculated  under  K-IFRS  1103  ‘Business 
Combinations’ at the date of the initial combination, and minority interest of changes in equity after the business 
combination.  
 
(23) Government subsidy 
Government subsidy without repayment obligation, which is used for the acquisition of certain assets, is accounted 
for  as  a  deduction  from  the  acquisition  cost  of  the  acquired  assets.  Such  subsidy  amount  is  offset  against  the 
depreciation or amortization of the acquired assets during such assets’ useful life.  
 
(24) Interest income and expense 
Interest income and expense are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The effective 
interest method measures the amortized costs of financial instruments and allocates the interest income or expense 
during the related period.  
 
Upon the calculation of the effective interest rate, the Group estimates future cash flows by taking into consideration 
all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not future credit loss. The calculation also reflects any fees or 
points paid or received, transaction costs and any related premiums or discounts. In the case that the cash flow and 
expected duration of a financial instrument cannot be estimated reliably, the effective interest rate is calculated by 
the contractual cash flow during the contract period.  
 
Once an impairment loss has been recognized on a financial asset or a group of similar assets, subsequent interest 
income is recognized on the interest rate that was used to discount future cash flow for measuring the impairment 
loss..37Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 
3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(25) Fees and commission income 
Fees and commission income and expense are classified as follows according to related regulations:(i) Fees and commission from financial instruments 
Fees and commission income and expense that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset or 
liability are included in the measurement of the effective interest rate. It includes those related to evaluation of the 
borrowers’  financial  status,  guarantee,  collateral,  other  agreements  and  related  evaluation  as  well  as  business 
transaction,  rewards  for  activities,  such  as  document preparation  and recording  and setup  fees  incurred during 
issuance of financial liabilities. However, when financial instruments are classified as financial instruments at fair 
value through profit or loss, fees and commission are recognized as revenue upon initial recognition.  
 
(ii) Fees and commission from services 
Fees and commission income charged in exchange for services to be performed during a certain period of time such 
as asset management fees, consignment fees and assurance service fees are recognized as the related services are 
performed.  When  a  loan  commitment  is  not  expected  to  result  in  the  draw-down  of  a  loan  and  K-IFRS  1109 
‘Financial Instrument’ is not applied for the commitment, the related loan commitment fees are recognized as 
revenue proportionally to time over the commitment period.(iii) Fees and commission from significant transaction 
Fees and commission from significant transactions, such as trading stocks and other securities, negotiation and 
mediation activities for third parties, for instance business transfer and takeover, are recognized when transactions 
are completed. 
 
(26) Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognized upon the establishment of the Group’s right to receive the payment.  
 
(27) Income tax expense 
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. Current income tax and deferred income tax are 
recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event, which is recognized 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, or a business combination.  
 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the reporting 
period when the assets are realized or the liabilities settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities reflects the income tax effects that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end 
of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.  
 
Subsidiaries calculate income tax based on their tax laws and report the amount as current income tax liability.  
 
The  Group  recognizes  deferred  income  tax  liabilities  for  all  taxable  temporary  differences  associated  with 
investments in subsidiaries, associates, and interests in joint ventures, except to the extent that the Group is able to 
control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. The Group recognizes deferred income tax assets for all deductible temporary 
differences arising from investments in associates, to the extent that it is probable that the temporary difference will 
reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be 
utilized.  
 
The carrying amount of a deferred income tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to 
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or 
all of that deferred income tax asset to be utilized.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only if the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset the 
related current income tax assets and liabilities, and the assets and liabilities relate to income tax levied by the same 
tax authority and are intended to be settled on a net basis.118119Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 
3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(28) Accounting for trust accounts 
The Group, for the purpose of financial reporting, differentiates trust assets from identifiable assets according to 
the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act. Furthermore, the Group receives trust fees from the 
application, management and disposal of trust assets, and appropriates such amounts for fees from trust accounts.  
 
Meanwhile, in the case the fee from an unspecified principal or interests guaranteed money in trust does not meet 
the principal or interest amount, even after appropriating deficit with trust fees and special reserve, the Group fills 
in the remaining deficit in the trust account and appropriates such amounts for losses on trust accounts.  
  
(29) Regulatory reserve for credit losses 
When the total sum of allowance for possible credit losses under K-IFRS is lower than the amount prescribed in 
Article  29(1)  of  the  Regulations  on  Supervision  of  Banking  Business,  the  Group  records  the  difference  as  a 
regulatory reserve for credit losses at the end of each reporting period.  
 
In the case that the existing regulatory reserve for credit losses exceeds the amount needed to be set aside at the 
reporting date, the surplus may be reversed. Furthermore, in the case that undisposed deficit exists, a regulatory 
reserve for credit losses is saved from the time the undisposed deficit is disposed.  
 
(30) Earnings per share 
The  Group  represents  its  diluted  and  basic  earnings  per  common  share  in  the  consolidated  statement  of 
comprehensive income. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit attributable to shareholders of 
the Group by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted 
earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  adjusting  net  profit  attributable  to  common  shareholders  of  the  Group, 
considering dilution effects from all potential common shares, and the weighted average number of common shares 
outstanding.(31) Correction of errors 
Prior period errors shall be corrected by retrospective restatement in the first set of financial statements authorised 
for issue after their discovery except to the extent that it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific 
effects or the cumulative effect of the error.Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

10.    Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Group’s derivative financial instruments consist of trading derivatives and hedging derivatives, depending on 
the nature of each transaction. The Group enters into hedging derivative transactions mainly for the purpose of 
hedging risk related to changes in fair values of the underlying assets and liabilities and future cash flows.  
 
The Group enters into trading derivative transactions such as futures, forwards, swaps and options for arbitrage 
transactions by speculating on the future value of the underlying asset. Trading derivative transactions include 
contracts with the Group’s clients and its liquidation position.  
 
For the purpose of hedging the exposure to the variability of fair values and future cash flows of funds in Korean 
won by changes in interest rate, the Group mainly uses interest swaps or currency swaps. The main counterparties 
are foreign financial institutions and local banks. In addition, to hedge the exposure to the variability of fair values 
of bonds in foreign currencies by changes in interest rate or foreign exchange rate, the Group mainly uses interest 
swaps or currency swaps.  
 
The Group applies net investment hedge accounting by designating non-derivative financial instruments as hedging 
instruments  and  any  gain  or  loss  on  the  hedging  instruments  relating  to  the  effective  portion  of  the  hedge  is 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. 
 
Gains and losses on the hedging instrument accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified 
to profit or loss on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation.(3) Losses related to loans measured at amortized cost for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as2021WW(623,039)

49.    Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities, Continued(2) Fair value hierarchy of financial instruments disclosed by fair value 
 
(i) The Group’s policies for measuring fair value of financial instruments at amortized costs are as follows:-  Cash and due from banks: Fair value of cash is considered equivalent to the carrying amount. In the case of 
due from banks on demand, which do not have a set maturity and can be realized instantly, the carrying 
amount is a close estimate of the fair value and is assumed so. In the case of other ordinary due from banks, 
the cash flow discount method is used to estimate the fair value.-  Securities measured at amortized cost: The fair value of securities measured at amortized cost is computedby widely-accepted appraisal agencies upon request.-  Loans measured at amortized cost: The fair value of loans measured at amortized cost is the expected future 
cash flows, reflecting premature redemption ratio, discounted by the market interest rate, adjusted by a spread 
sheet considering the probability of default. Exceptions to this method include loans with credit line facilities, 
loans with a maturity of three months or less left and impaired loans, which the Group assumes the carrying 
amount as the fair value.-  Deposits:  The  fair  value  of  deposits  is  computed  using  the  discounted  cash  flow  method.  However,  for 
deposits, whose cash flows cannot be estimated reasonably, the Bank assumes the carrying amount as the fair 
value.-  Borrowings: The fair value of industrial financial debentures is computed using the discounted cash flow 
method by the Group’s Fair Value Evaluation System. However, for borrowings including call money whose 
contractual maturity is three months or less, the Group assumes the carrying amount as the fair value.-  Debentures: The fair value of industrial financial debentures is computed using the discounted cash flowmethod by the Group’s Fair Value Evaluation System.-  Other financial assets and liabilities: The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities is computed using 
the discounted cash flow method. However, in cases cash flow cannot be estimated reasonably, the Group 
assumes the carrying amount as the fair value.(ii) The fair value hierarchy of financial instruments measured at amortized costs as of December 31, 2021 and2020 are as follows:Financial assets:Cash and due from banks (*)

53.    Risk Management(1) Introduction 
 
(i) Objectives and principles 
The Group’s risk management aims to maintain financial soundness and effectively manage various risks pertinent 
to the nature of the Group’s business. The Group has set up and fulfilled policies to manage risks timely and 
effectively. Pursuant to the policies, the Group’s risks shall be 
- managed comprehensively and independently, 
- recognized timely, evaluated exactly and managed effectively, 
- maintained to the extent that the risks balance with profit, 
- diversified appropriately to avoid concentration on specific segments, 
- managed to prevent excessive exposure by the setting up and managing of tolerance limits and guidelines.  
 
(ii) Risk management strategy and process 
The Group’s risk management business is separated into two different stages; the ‘metrification stage,’ in which 
risks  are  estimated  and  monitored,  and  the  ‘integration  stage,’  in  which  information  gained  during  the  risk 
management process is integrated and used in management strategies. Risk management is recognized as a key 
component of the Group’s management, and seeks to change from its previously adaptive and limited role to more 
leading and comprehensive role.  
 
Furthermore, the Group focuses on consistent communication among different departments in order to establish a 
progressive consensus on risk management.  
 
(iii) Risk management governance 
 
Risk Management Committee 
The Group’s Risk Management Committee (the “Committee”) is composed of the President of the committee (an 
outside director),  and  three other  commissioners  including  the  CEO of the  Bank.  The  Committee  functions  to 
establish policies of risk management, evaluate the capital adequacy of the Group, discuss material issues relating 
to risk management, and present preliminary decisions on such matters. 
 
The CEO of the Bank and the head of Risk Management Segment 
The CEO of the Bank, according to the policies of risk management, performs his or her role to manage and direct 
risk management in order to sustain efficiency and internal control. The head of the Risk Management Segment is 
responsible for supervising the overall administration of the Group’s risk management business and providing risk-
related information to members of the board of directors and the Group’s management.  
 
Risk Management Policy Committee 
The  Group’s  Risk  Management  Policy  Committee  is  composed  of  the  leaders  of  all  business  segments.  and 
exercises its role to decide important matters relating to the Group’s portfolio including allocating internal capital 
limits  by  segment  and  setting  exposure  limits  by  industry within  the  scope  that  Risk  Management  Committee 
regulated.131132Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

IFRS 9systems was completed in March 2021.(vii) Response to Basel 
The Korean financial authorities have implemented Basel II since January 2008, and adopted the Standardized 
Approach and the Foundation Internal Ratings-Based Approach.  
 
In conformity with the implementation roadmap of Basel II, the Group obtained the approval to use the Foundation 
Internal Ratings-Based Approach on credit risk from the FSS in July 2008 and has applied the approach since late 
June 2008. The Group applies the Standardized Approach on market risks and operational risks.  
 
The Group completed the Basel III standard risk management system in preparation of the adoption of the Basel III 
regulations announced on December 1, 2013. Starting from 2013 year-end, the BIS capital adequacy ratio has been 
measured in accordance to the Basel III regulations.  
 
Responding to the requirement of the financial authorities, the Group recognizes interest rate risk, liquidity risk, 
credit bias risk and reputational risk as well as Pillar I risks (credit risk, market risk and operational risk). Since 
2015,  the  Group  has  responded  to  Pillar  II  regulations  including  additional  capital  requirements  based  on 
comprehensive assessment on bank risk management level. In addition, from the end of 2015, the Group has applied 
the uniform standards for the public announcement of financial business for Basel compliance.  
 
The Group completed revised standards such as capital requirements for banks’ investments in funds in 2017, 
capital requirements for securitization in 2018, and the Standardised Approach for measuring counterparty credit 
risk (SA-CCR) in 2019. 
 
To comply with the amended regulation relating to risk-weighted assets under Basel III, the Group completed the 
consultation and the development of the relevant systems and the amended regulation has been applied since the 
calculation of the BIS ratio at the end of 2020.factors for internal purposes  Setting management limit of credit portfolios of 2021

53.    Risk Management, Continued(viii) Internal capital adequacy assessment process 
Internal capital adequacy assessment process is defined as the process that the Group aggregates significant risks, 
calculates its internal capital, compares the internal capital with the available capital and assesses its internal capital 
adequacy. The internal capital adequacy report including the assessment results at the end of the year is prepared 
and reported to the Risk Management Policy Committee. 
 
- Internal capital adequacy assessment 
For the internal capital adequacy assessment, the Group calculates its aggregated internal capital by evaluating 
all significant risks and available capital considering the quality and components of capital, and then assesses the 
internal capital adequacy by comparing the aggregated internal capital with the available capital. 
 
In addition, the Group conducts periodic stress tests more than once every six months to assess potential weakness 
in  crisis  situations  and  uses  its  results  to  assess  the  internal  capital  adequacy.  The  Group  assumes  the 
macroeconomic situation as three stages of ‘normal-pessimistic-serious’ and is preparing countermeasures such 
as checking the adequacy of capital by each stage. 
 
- Goal setting of internal capital management 
The Group sets up and manages an internal capital limit on an annual basis, through the approval of the Risk 
Management Committee, to maintain internal capital adequacy by managing internal capital (integrated risks) 
within the extent of available capital. 
 
The prior year’s internal capital, analysis of domestic and foreign environment changes in the current year, and 
the direction and size of operations are all reflected in the goal setting of internal capital management to calculate 
the integrated internal capital scale. Moreover, Bank for International Settlements(BIS) capital adequacy ratio 
and risk appetite are taken into consideration in the goal setting of internal capital management. 
 
- Allocation of internal capital 
The Group’s Risk Management Committee approves entire internal capital and the Risk Management Policy 
Committee allocates the capital to each segment and department, considering the extent of possible risk faced 
and  size  of  operations.  The  allocated  internal  capital  is  monitored  regularly  and  managed  using  various 
management methods. The results of monitoring and managing the allocated internal capital are reported to the 
Risk Management Committee. In case of any material changes in the Group’s business plan or risk operation 
strategy, the Group adjusts the allocations elastically.- Composition of internal capital 
Internal  capital  comprises  all  the  significant  risks  of  the  Group  and  is  composed  of  quantifiable  and  non-
quantifiable risks. Quantifiable risks are composed of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk 
and credit concentration risk, foreign currency settlement risk, and are risks measured quantitatively by applying 
reasonable methodology using objective data. Non-quantifiable risks are composed of strategy risk, reputation 
risk, residual risk on asset securitization and furthermore. Non-quantifiable risks are those risks that cannot be 
measured quantitatively because of lack of data or the absence of appropriate measuring methodologies.(2) Credit Risk(i) ConceptCredit  risk  can  be  defined  as  potential  loss  resulting  from  the  refusal  to  perform  obligations  or  default  of 
counterparties. More generally, it is used to refer to the possibility of loss from engaged bonds that cannot be 
redeemed properly or from substitute payments.210211Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

53.    Risk Management, Continued(ii) Approach to credit risk management 
 
Summary of credit risk management 
The Group regards credit risk as the most significant risk area in its business operations, and accordingly, closely 
monitors its credit risk exposure. The Group manages both credit risks at portfolio level and at individual credit 
level. At portfolio level, the Group reduces credit concentration and restructures the portfolio in such a way to 
maximize profitability considering the risk level. To avoid credit concentration on a particular sector, the Group 
manages credit limits by client, group, and industry. The Group also resets exposure management directives for 
each industry by conducting an industry credit evaluation twice a year.At  the  individual  credit  level,  the  relationship  manager  (RM),  the  credit  officer  (CO)  and  the  Credit  Review 
Committee manage each borrower’s credit risk.Post management and insolvent borrower management 
The Group monitors the borrower’s credit rating from the date of the loan to the date of the final collection of debt 
consistently and inspects the borrower’s status frequently to prevent the generation of new bad debts and to stabilize 
the number of debt recoveries. 
 
In addition, an early warning system is operated to spot borrowers that are highly likely to be insolvent. The early 
warning system provides financial information, financial transaction information, public information and market 
information of the borrower, and such information is used by the RM and the CO to monitor and manage changes 
in the borrower’s credit rating.  
 
A borrower that is likely to be insolvent is classified as an early warning borrower, depending on the level of 
insolvency risk. The Group sets up a specific and applicable stabilization plan for such a borrower considering the 
borrower’s  characteristics.  Furthermore,  sub-standard  borrowers  are  classified  as  insolvent  borrowers,  and  are 
managed intensively by the Group, which takes legal proceedings, disposals or corporate turnaround measures if 
necessary.   
 
Classification of asset soundness and provision of allowance for loss 
Classification of asset soundness is fulfilled by the analysis and assessment of credit risk. The classification is used 
in order to provision an appropriate allowance, prevent further occurrences of insolvent assets and promote the 
normalization of existing insolvent assets to enhance the stabilization of asset operations.  
 
Based on the Financial Supervisory Regulations of the Republic of Korea, the Group has established standards and 
guidelines on the classification of asset soundness, according to the Forward-Looking Criteria (FLC), which reflects 
not only the borrower’s past records of repayment but also their future debt repayment capability.  
 
In conformity with these standards, the Group classifies the soundness of its assets as “normal”, “precautionary”, 
“substandard”, “doubtful”, or “estimated loss” and differentiates the coverage ratio by the level of classification.

53.    Risk Management, Continued(iii) Measurement methodology of credit risk 
Pursuant to Basel III, the Group selects the measurement methodology of credit risk considering the complexity of 
measurement,  measurement  factors,  estimating  methods  and  others.  Measurement  approaches  are  divided  into 
Standardized Approach and Internal Ratings-Based Approach.  
 
Standardized Approach (SA) 
In the case of the Standardized Approach, the risk weights are applied according to the credit rating assessed by 
External Credit Assessment Institution (ECAI). Risk weights in each credit rating are as follows:Credit rating 
AAA ~ AA-
A+ ~ A-BBB+ ~ BBB-
BB+ ~ BB- 
B+ ~ B- 
Below B- 
UnratedCorporate20.0%

150.0%Rating based on duediligence(*) In case of small and medium-sized business, 85.0% is applied. 
 
The OECD is designated as foreign ECAI and Korea Investors Service Co., Ltd., NICE Investors Services Co., Ltd. 
and the Korea Ratings Co., Ltd. are designated as domestic ECAI.  
 
The Group applies the credit rating based on the corresponding loan and same borrower’s unsecured senior loans. 
In the case the borrower’s risk weight is higher than the unrated exposure’s risk weight (100%), the higher weight 
is applied. In the case the borrower has more than one rating, the higher weight of the two lowest weights (Second 
Best Criteria) is applied.Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2021 and 2020 
 
53.    Risk Management, ContinuedInternal Ratings-Based Approach (IRB) 
To  use  the  Internal  Ratings-Based  Approach,  a  bank  must  be  approved  by  the  FSS  and  should  also  meet  the 
requirement pre-set by the FSS.  
 
In relation to Basel II that has been adopted domestically as of January 2008, the Group gained approval from the 
FSS to use the Foundation Internal Ratings-Based Approach in July 2008. The Group has calculated credit risk-
weighted assets using the approach since late June 2008.  
 
Measurement method of credit risk-weighted asset 
The Group calculates credit risk-weighted assets of corporate exposures and asset securitization exposures using 
the Foundation Internal Ratings-Based Approach as of December 31, 2021. 
 
The  Standardized  Approach  is  applied  to  country  exposures,  public  institution  exposures  and  bank  exposures 
permanently and applied to overseas subsidiary and the Bank’s branch pursuant to prior consultation with the FSS. 
 
<Approved measurement method>Measurement methodStandardized ApproachPermanent SASAFoundation Internal Ratings-Based ApproachExposure- Countries, public institutions, banks and equity
- Overseas subsidiaries and branches, and other assets,retail, residential mortgage, commercial properties
- Corporate, small and medium enterprises and assetsecuritization (at each credit level)- Special lending, non-residence and othersApplication of IRB by phaseThe mitigated effect of credit risks reflects the related policies which consider eligible collateral and guarantees. 
The Group calculates the credit risk-weighted assets using the capital adequacy ratio.  
 
Upon the calculation of credit risk-weighted assets for derivatives, the Group takes into consideration the set-off 
effects of transactions under legally enforceable rights to set-off to calculate exposures.139140Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

53.    Risk Management, ContinuedCredit rating model 
The results of credit rating are presented as grades through an assessment of the debt repayment capacity that the 
principal  and  interest  of  debt  securities  or  loans  are  redeemed  while  complying  with  contractual  redemption 
schedule.  
 
Using the Group’s internal credit rating model, the Group classifies debtors’ credit rating into 14 grades (AAA~D). 
To distinguish the difference between credits in the same grade, the Group uses 20 stages as auxiliaries to 14 grades. 
 
The Group’s regular credit rating process is carried out once a year and in the case of the change of debtor’s credit 
condition, the credit rating is frequently adjusted as necessary to retain the adequacy of credit rating.  
 
The results of credit rating are applied to various areas such as discrimination of loan processes, loan limit, loan 
interest  rate,  post  loan  management  standard  process,  credit  risk  measurement,  and  allowance  for  loan  losses 
assessment.Credit rating process control structure 
According to the Principle of Checks and Balances, the Group has established the credit rating process control 
structure by which the credit rating system operates appropriately.  
 
-  Independent  assessment  of  credit  rating:  The  Bank’s  business  segment  (RM)  and  credit  rating  assessmentsegment (SRO) are independently operated.-  Independent control of credit rating system: The control of credit rating system including the development ofcredit rating model is independently implemented by the Bank’s Risk Management Department.-  Independent  verification  of  credit  rating  system:  Credit  rating  system  is  independently  verified  by  RiskValidation Team of the Financial Planning Department.-  Internal audit of credit rating process: Credit rating process is audited by the Bank’s internal audit department. 
-  Role of the Board of Directors and the Bank’s management: Major issues relating to credit rating process areapproved by the Board of Directors and are regularly monitored by the Bank’s top management.The Group reviews debt serviceability based on a credit analysis when handling loans. Depending on the results, 
credit loan preservation is adjusted as necessary using such methods as interest rate preservation due to credit risk.  
 
The Group evaluates the value of the collateral, performing ability and legal validity of the guarantee at the initial 
acquisition. The Group re-evaluates the provided collateral and guarantees regularly for them to be reasonably 
preserved.  
 
For guarantees, the Group demands a corresponding written guarantee according to loan handling standards and the 
guarantor’s  credit  rating  is  independently  calculated  when  in  conformance  with  the  credit  rating  endowment 
method. 
 
The quantification of the extent to which collateral and other credit enhancements mitigate credit risk of impaired 
financial assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:December 31, 2021December 31, 20201,254

53.    Risk Management, Continued(3) Capital management activities  
 
(i) Capital adequacy 
The FSS approved the Group’s use of the Foundation Internal Ratings-Based Approach in July 2008. The Group 
has been using the same approach when calculating credit risk-weighted assets since the end of June 2008. The 
equity capital ratio and equity capital according to the standards of the Bank for International Settlements are 
calculated for such disclosure. The equity capital ratio and equity capital are calculated on a consolidated basis. In 
conformity  with  the  Banking  Act,  which  is  based  on  the  implementation  of  Basel  III  on  December  2013,  the 
regulatory capital is divided into the following two categories.  
 
Tier 1 capital (Common Equity Tier 1 + Additional Tier 1 capital) 
-  Common Equity Tier 1 
Regulatory  capital  that  represents  the  most  subordinated  claim  in  liquidation  of  the  Group,  takes  the  first  and 
proportionately greatest share of any losses as they occur, and which principal is never repaid outside of liquidation 
meets the criteria for classification as common equity, including capital stock, capital surplus, retained earnings, 
and accumulated other comprehensive income as common equity Tier 1.  
 
-  Additional Tier 1 capital 
Capital stock and capital surplus related to issuance of capital securities that are subordinated, have non-cumulative 
and conditional dividends or interests, and have no maturity or step-up conditions.Tier 2 capital (Supplementary Tier 2 capital) 
Regulatory capital that fulfils supplementary capital adequacy requirements, and includes subordinated debt with 
maturities over 5 years and allowance for loan losses in conformity with external regulatory standards and internal 
standards.7,564,234   61,723,627

53.    Risk Management, Continued(4) Market risk 
 
(i) Concept 
Market  risk  is  defined  as  the  possibility  of  potential  loss  resulting  from  fluctuations  in  interest  rates,  foreign 
exchange rates and the price of stocks and commodities. Trading position is exposed to risks, such as interest rate, 
stock price, and foreign exchange rate, etc. Non-trading position is mostly exposed to interest rates. Accordingly, 
the  Group  classifies  market  risks  into  those  exposed  from  trading  position  or  those  exposed  from  non-trading 
position.  
 
(ii) Market risks of trading positions
 
Management method on market risks arising from trading positions 
In estimating market risk, the Standardized Approach and the internal model are used. The Standardized Approach 
is used to calculate the required capital from market risk and the internal model is used to manage risks internally. 
Since July 2007, the Group has measured one-day VaR through the historical simulation method using the time 
series data of past 250 days under a 99% confidence level. The calculated VaR is monitored daily. 
 
The Group sets total limit of market risk based on annual business plan, risk appetite and others and monitors VaR 
limit of each department on a daily basis. 
 
Capital Requirements for Market risk 
The Group’s Capital Requirements for Market risk as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:

119,201December 31, 2020December 31, 2021(iii) Market risks of non-trading positions
 
Management method on market risks arising from non-trading positions 
The most critical market risk that arises in non-trading position is the interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is defined 
as the likely loss resulting from the unfavorable fluctuation of interest rate in the Group’s financial condition and is 
measured by IRRBB (Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book), △EVE (change in Economic Value of Equity) and 
△NII (change in Net Interest Income). 
 
△EVE represents fluctuations in the economic value of equity capital that may occur due to changes in interest 
rates affecting the present values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. △NII represents changes in net 
interest income that may occur over a certain period of time (e.g. one year) in the future due to changes in interest 
rates. 
 
The Group’s Risk Management Committee sets and manages interest rate risk limits on a yearly basis and interest 
rate risk is monthly measured and monitored.△EVE and △NII of the Group’s non-trading positions as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:△EVE

53.    Risk Management, Continued(v) Interest rate risk management 
 
The Group is closely monitoring the outputs prepared by the industrial working groups which is managing the 
transition to alternative benchmark rates and the markets related the rates. The outputs include the information 
published by regulatory authorities related to IBORs.  The authorities  have made it clear that after the end of 2021, 
they will no longer persuade or force banks to submit IBORs. Responding the transition, the Group organized a task 
force led by the head of the risk management division and the task force has established the LIBOR transition plan 
that  consists  of  work  flows  such  as  alternative  interest  rate  determination,  application  development,  customer 
communication management, risk management, taxation, finance, legal, and accounting system establishment.  The 
important progress of the plan is reported to the management and may also be reported to the board of directors if 
necessary. The purpose of the task force is to review where exposure to IBOR occurs within the Group’s business,

53.    Risk Management, Continued(5) Liquidity risk management 
 
(i) Concept 
Liquidity risk is defined as the possibility of potential loss due to a temporary shortage in funds caused by a maturity 
mismatch or an unexpected capital outlay. Liquidity risk soars when funding rates rise, assets are sold below a 
normal price, or a good investment opportunity is missed.  
 
(ii) Approach to liquidity risk management 
The Group manages its liquidity risks as follows:Allowable limit for liquidity risk 
 The allowable limit for liquidity risk sets LCR, NSFR and  Mid- to long-term foreign currency fund management 
ratio The management standards with regards to the allowable limit for liquidity risk should be set using separate andstringent set ratios in accordance with the FSS guidelines.<Measurement Methodology> 
 LCR: (High quality liquid assets / Total net cash outflows over the next 30 calendar days) X 100 
 NSFR: Available Stable Funding / Required Stable Funding X 100 
 Mid- to long-term foreign currency fund management ratio: Foreign currency funding being repaid after 1 year / 
Foreign currency lending being collected after 1 year X 100Early warning indicator 
In order to identify prematurely and cope with worsening liquidity risk trends, the Group has set up 16 indexes such 
as the “Foreign Exchange Stabilization Bond CDS Premium,” and measures the trend monthly, weekly and daily 
as a means for establishing the allowable liquidity risk limit complementary measures.  
 
Stress-Test analysis and contingency plan 
 The  Group  evaluates  the  effects  on  the  liquidity  risk  and  identifies  the  inherent  flaws.  In  the  case  where  an 
unpredictable and significant liquidity crisis occurs, the Group executes risk situation analysis quarterly based on 
crisis specific to the Group, market risk and complex emergency, and reports to the Risk Management Committee 
for the purpose of the Group’s solvency securitization. The Group established detailed contingency plan to manage the liquidity risks at every risk situations.154155Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
