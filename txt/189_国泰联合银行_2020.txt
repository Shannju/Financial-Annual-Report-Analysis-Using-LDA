threat  of  COVID-19.  Many  countries  underwent  recession,  and  as  uncertainties  and  risks 
emerge with respect to future industry prospects, they responded with large-scale fiscal and 
monetary measures that injected unprecedented levels of liquidity into the financial market, 
increasing  volatility  of  asset  prices.  Meanwhile,  changes  in  international  politics  and 
economic interactions caused a worldwide restructuring of global supply chains, all of which 
posed a challenge to the organization’s asset management and risk management capabilities. 
Fortunately, the Bank has been actively enforcing transformations in recent years, and was 
able to develop high levels of agility and efficiency to respond to changes. Even in such a 
turbulent  year,  the  Bank  still  managed  to  maintain  both  quality  and  size  of  its  assets,  and 
delivered record-high consolidated after-tax earnings of US$790 million in 2020!The  Bank  reinforces  its  existing  competitive  advantage  by  continually  adopting  a 
customer-centric  philosophy  and  improving  service  quality.  In  addition  to  operating  a 
domestic network of 165 branches that serves customers face-to-face, the Bank continues to 
expand the coverage of automated equipment including ATMs so that customers may access 
the financial services they need anytime, anywhere. Furthermore, in light of consumers’ shift 
towards digital lifestyle, the Bank has invested actively into data infrastructures and mobile 
banking, and formed alliances with partners of different industries as a means to introduce 
financial services to a broader diversity of lifestyles and scenarios. The Bank’s services have 
been well-trusted by the general public as well as customers, whereas its effort for excellence 
has also been highly recognized among professional institutions local and abroad, including 
Best  Frictionless  Customer  Experience  by  The  Asian  Banker,  Best  Service  Provider-E-
Solutions Partner in Taiwan by The Asset, Best Private Bank  – Taiwan Domestic by Asian 
Private  Banker,  Best  Wealth  Management  Bank  in  Business  Today’s  Wealth  Management 
Bank and Securities Evaluation for five consecutive years, Best Trust Service in Best-Practice 
Awards organized by Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance for the 4th time, and the only 
contender from Taiwan to win 2020 International Business Awards of The Stevie Awards, the 
most prestigious award in the business world, thereby making Cathay the leading financial 
brand in Taiwan!We  continue  to  explore  overseas  markets  for  new  growth  opportunities.  The  Bank 
currently  has  67  offices  located  in  the  Greater  China  Region  and ASEAN,  making  it  the 
Taiwanese bank with the widest coverage in Southeast Asia. Recent political and economic 
changes around the world have driven supply chain participants to move into Southeast Asia, 
where  the  Bank  has  a  long-established  presence;  the  upgrade  of  the  Myanmar  Office  to 
Yangon Branch in 2021 will further strengthen the Bank’s overseas presence and make it the 
most  reliable  partner  to  all  Taiwanese  enterprises  seeking  to  grow  business  abroad.  The 
addition of the Yangon Branch will also contribute to the Bank’s goal of becoming a leading 
regional bank.The  Bank  has  devoted  attention  to  corporate  sustainability  (CS)  in  addition  to  raising 
earnings per share (EPS) for many years. Not only was it the first Taiwanese bank to sign the 
commitment  to  the  Equator  Principles  and  announce  its  voluntary  compliance  with  UN 
“Principles for Responsible Banking,” the Bank also persistently supports renewable energy 
sources such as solar and wind power through green financing and strives to become a leader 
in green banking. The Bank continues to play a leading role in charity and nursing trusts as1well, helping residents and the government prepare for a hyper-aged society, while at the same 
time  offering  relief  loans  to  businesses  and  workers  to  help  them  through  the  challenging 
times  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic. The  Bank  has  also  implemented  a  series  of  sustainable 
measures within the organization; smart meters are deployed at branches to minimize wastage 
of resources, whereas employees are constantly reminded of the importance to reduce plastics 
and carbon, and mobilized to perform coastal cleanup among other environmental protection 
activities from time to time. This initiative at promoting sustainable values among employees 
has won the Bank multiple awards from the Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy (TAISE) 
in  2020,  including  Cybersecurity  Award,  People  Development  Awards,  Social  Inclusion 
Awards, and Creativity in Communication Awards, making it the highest award-winning bank 
in Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Awards (TCSA) 2020.The  pandemic  and  outlook  of  the  global  economy  will  continue  to  be  the  two  key 
variables  affecting  overall  performance  of  the  financial  industry  in  2021.  In  light  of  the 
challenges ahead, Cathay United Bank will continue adhering to its “Integrity, Accountability, 
and  Creativity”  values  as  well  as  a  customer-centric  philosophy,  and  consolidate  group 
resources  to  provide  customers  with  more  comprehensive  financial  services,  thereby 
achieving the pinnacle of success in Asia Pacific while fulfilling its vision as the No. 1 brand 
in Taiwan!II.  Business Report for the year 2020Changes in the local and foreign financial environment and outcomes of business planand strategy for 2020 are explained below:The  ongoing  pandemic  brings  additional  uncertainty  to  the  outlook  of  the  global 
economy,  whereas  the  low  interest  environment  combined  with  the  uprise  of  online-only 
banks and increasing homogeneity in financial services have made profitability more difficult 
to  sustain.  At  the  same  time,  banks  are  presented  with  challenges  from  changes  in  the 
competitive landscape, and aside from the three online-only banks that will be commencing 
operations, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has proposed amendments to “The 
Act  Governing  Electronic  Payment  Institutions”  in  an  attempt  to  make  electronic  payment 
more  popular  among  consumers.  These  amendments  will  attract  market  leaders  such  as 
Shopee, PX Mart, and FamilyMart into electronic payment service, and inevitably alter the 
state and ecosystem of current payment services. Their effects on the credit card market will 
have to be monitored closely.While the authority’s decision to deregulate on the licensing of online-only banks and 
electronic payment services may cannibalize businesses and revenues of existing banks in the 
short term, it will inspire creativity and productive competition within the banking industry 
over time. As the world becomes more aware of anti-money laundering and counter terrorist 
financing and holds banks more accountable for risk identification, the Bank has taken pro-
active steps to develop relevant systems and teams to ensure compliance with prevailing laws.The  Bank  has  been  actively  enhancing  the  quality  and  diversity  of  services  delivered 
over digital channels as a response to the growing popularity of mobile banking and increasing 
competition for digital customers. In addition  to improving customer experience, the Bank 
also applies big data technology to analyze its extensive customer database (e.g. policyholder 
after-sale  data  analysis,  customer  insurance  needs  analysis)  for  timely  monitoring  of 
customers’ needs and preferences, and to satisfy them with appropriate financial services and2solutions.The  Bank  will  strive  to  maintain  consistency  of  its  business  performance,  bring  more 
complete  financial  services  and  account  features  to  customers,  and  secure  deposit  source 
while at the same time developing integrated investment solutions for customers of special 
needs, and take advantage of group synergy by cross-selling them through Cathay subsidiaries 
online as well as offline to attract new capital.  The  Bank  had  been  able  to  maintain  growth  across  all  main  business  activities;  keyaccomplishments are as follows:(I)  Consumer banking serviceThe Bank continues to improve fundamental services to customers by adopting a needs-
driven  approach.  With  a  comprehensive  network  of  physical  and  digital  channels 
available at disposal, the Bank is able to introduce integrated financial services and the 
ultimate one-stop shopping experience for customers of various profiles. The spread of 
COVID-19  subsided  in  Taiwan  in  the  second  half  of  2020,  and  a  low-interest 
environment combined with the return of Taiwanese enterprises increased demand for 
consumer  banking  solutions.  The  Bank  had  capitalized  on  this  development  by 
delivering  good online borrowing experience. Consumer banking credit balance as of 
the end of 2020 exhibited strong growth over 2019.1.  Deposit  balance  amounted  to  NT$2,594  billion  at  the  end  of  2020,  up  12.3%compared to 2019; 71.8% of the NTD deposit balance were demand deposits.2.  At the end of 2020, outstanding balance across mortgage products (including: home 
equity loan) totaled NT$784.2 billion, up NT$85.2 billion or 12.19% growth from 
the  end  of  2019.  Balance  of  small  amount  loan  products  amounted  to  NT$100.6 
billion, up NT$13.3 billion or 15.23% growth from the end of 2019.(II)  Wholesale banking serviceGrowth of wholesale banking remained strong, and the Bank continued its strategy of 
industry segment management while offering integrated one-stop shopping to satisfy the 
needs  of  different  customers.  Meanwhile,  support  of  group  resources  helped  improve 
efficiency of business expansion efforts and maintain proper risk-return balance. As of 
the end of 2020, wholesale banking loan balance across domestic channels amounted to 
NT$486.8 billion.(III)  Wealth management serviceThe Bank delivers wealth management services with a “customer-centric” philosophy 
and takes the initiative to learn customers’ needs. Given the volume of misinformation 
circulating  the  financial  market,  the  Bank  provides  customers  with  market  analysis, 
investment strategy, product, and service recommendations that are suited to their needs, 
and  exercises  more  rigorous  risk  monitoring  over  customers’  investment  positions  to 
help them reach their goals. Differentiated products were offered to the investment needs 
of high net worth customers, and a team of professionals was assembled to provide tax 
and  wealth  transfer  plans.  Furthermore,  the  subsidiary  made  active  use  of  financial 
technologies  to  improve  service  procedures  for  online,  self-guided  investors,  and 
promoted insurance as a protection for improved service experience across all customers. 
Wealth  management  customers  increased  9%  in  size  and  11%  in  assets  under 
management  in  2020.  Overall,  the  Bank  was  able  to  sustain  growth  of  income  from3wealth management services.(IV)  Trust serviceAUM  of  real  estate  trusts  totaled  NT$61.2  billion  in  2020,  up  15.93%  from  2019, 
whereas  AUM  of  personal  and  corporate  trusts  amounted  to  NT$53.9  billion.  Total 
assets under custody amounted to NT$899.2 billion.(V)  Foreign currency service1.  The Bank has been active in the establishment of correspondence banking relations 
in  ASEAN  and  the  Greater  China  region  as  a  means  to  support  international 
businesses and facilitate more efficient transfer of capital in Asia. In the presence of 
a  strong  correspondence  banking  network,  the  Bank  is  able  to  appeal  to  a  larger 
number  of  customers  by  introducing  competitive  remittance  solutions  and  trade 
financing  products,  and  thereby  secure  the  foundation  of  success  in  the  foreign 
currency market.2.  Despite the challenging global environment, the Bank has been focusing on growing 
its foreign currency service. Using pattern analysis, the Bank was able to strengthen 
relationships  across  all  customer  segments  for  mutual  benefit.  Foreign  currency 
deposit  balance  in  2020  amounted  to  US$21.1  billion,  up  27%  from  2019; 
import/export transactions amounted to US$9.2 billion in 2020, up 22% from 2019; 
trade financing balance averaged US$1.5 billion in 2020, up 13% from 2019.(VI)  Credit card service1.  The Bank had 7.12 million outstanding cards at the end of 2020 while the number 
of active cards reached 5.13 million and credit card spending amounted to NT$493.3 
billion during the year, down 9.7% year-on-year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.2.  Continue  working  closely  with  industry  leaders  to  develop  innovative  payment 
scenarios  for  mutual  customer  acquisition,  and  adopt  differentiated  marketing 
combined  with  shared  membership  points  to  increase  cardholders’  revenue 
contribution.3.  Consumers’ spending patterns have changed as a result of the pandemic, and as a 
response, the Bank introduced new data-driven credit card privileges and discounts 
incorporating a broad variety of merchants to create and satisfy customers’ needs. 
Through  customized  services,  the  subsidiary  was  able  to  turn  crisis  into 
opportunities and generate revenues with improved competitiveness.4.  Competition in the credit card market continues to intensify, whereas campaign and 
product  rewards  are  undermining  profitability.  To  counteract  this  trend,  the  Bank 
shared data with merchants so that customers can be acquired, managed, and cross-
sold more efficiently for maximum yield, thereby securing competitiveness for the 
challenges ahead.4(VII) Payment service1.  Transaction  acquisition:  The  Bank  was  able  to  expand  its  transaction  acquisition 
network in 2020 to include prominent merchants including Smile (gas station chain), 
Costco North Taichung Branch, and Taipei Metro. Several control measures were 
undertaken in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in the first half of the year in 
order  to  secure  debt  entitlement  over  merchants;  in  the  second  half,  the  Bank 
completed phase 1 of its “acquisition automation” infrastructure. As of December 
2020, the Bank had contracted with 72,345 merchants.2.  New payment: In addition to promoting PX Mart’s PX PAY and FamilyMart’s My 
FamiPay, the Bank also worked with Taiwan’s leading bookstore chain, eslite, and 
mass retailer Costco to introduce two new mobile payment services – “eslite Pay” 
and “Costco Pay” to further expand mobile payment scenarios in 2020. The Bank 
helped  7-ELEVEN  expand  applications  of  its  OPEN  Wallet  to  include  14  other 
channels of President Group such as Cosmed and Starbucks, thereby securing the 
Bank’s leading advantage in new payment services.3.  Automated  channels  service:  A  total  of  15  million  transactions  were  completed 
using  ATM  in  2020,  representing  a  10%  growth;  the  Bank  had  4,706  ATMs 
deployed  nationwide,  representing  a  15%  market  share  and  ranking  2nd  in  the 
industry.(VIII)   Digital banking service1.  Website: A dedicated section on digital products and services has been created to 
build up brand image by connecting users’ lifestyle scenarios to the various products 
and  services  offered.  Meanwhile,  contents  of  the  loan  section  have  been  updated 
with  a  mobile  version  that  offers  various  features  such  as  online  application, 
consultation, and trial calculation. Visits to the mobile version increased 1.2 times 
in just one month after launch.2.  Online  banking  App:  Through  integration  of  online  and  offline  services  and  by 
leveraging the advantages of digital channels, the Bank saw a 55% increase in active 
users compared to the previous year. The App consolidates cash flow, NTD/foreign 
currency account, and credit card information and account opening features in such 
a way that not only improves user experience and usability of banking services, but 
also  creates  opportunities  for  cross-selling.  Other  products  such  as  smart 
investments and loans were added on a later date, and for enhanced security, the App 
allows facial recognition and video conferencing to be used for online application 
and login, whereas transaction alert was added to further distinguish from online-
only banks.3.  KOKO  APP:  Having  observed  young  customers’  lifestyles,  habits,  and  financial 
product needs, the Bank introduced new services including foreign currency account 
online opening and NTD account opening for underage applicants, and launched a 
new pet insurance called KOPet with the support of group resources. The App was 
the  first  in  the  industry  to  incorporate  real-time  communication  service,  which 
promotes better user experience, interaction, and attachment. For improved security, 
the  KOKO  App  adopts  world-class  security  standards  –  FIDO  –  and  uses 
asymmetric key as a simpler and more secure method of authentication. Meanwhile, 
optimizations were made to existing functions to ensure smoother digital experience.5(IX)  Overseas operationsThe  Bank  places  significant  emphasis  on  Greater  China  Region  and  Southeast Asia 
markets,  and  invests  actively  to  capitalize  on  growth  and  opportunities  within  Asia 
Pacific.  In  the  Greater  China  market,  the  Bank’s  mainland  subsidiary  continued  to 
enforce a localized business strategy and support top-performing Taiwanese enterprises. 
Through customized offerings, professional services, and cross-selling efforts, the Bank 
actively  promotes  RMB-denominated  financial  products  as  a  means  to  strengthen 
attachment  with  its  target  customers.  Meanwhile,  the  Hong  Kong  Branch  remains 
focused on growing wholesale banking, treasury and private banking services through 
cross-border  collaboration.  In  Southeast  Asia,  the  Bank  currently  has  branch 
establishments in 9 countries including Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore, Malaysia, the 
Philippines,  Laos,  Thailand,  Myanmar,  and  Indonesia,  making  it  the  most  widely 
established  Taiwanese  bank  in  Southeast Asia.  The Yangon  Office  in  Myanmar  also 
received approval to convert into Yangon Branch in 2020, and opened for business on 
January  8,  2021.  The  Bank  currently  has  2  wholly  owned  subsidiary  banks,  1  joint 
venture  bank,  7  branches,  and  4  representative  offices  overseas.  By  creating  a  cross-
border  financial  platform  and  banking  network  that  spans  across Taiwan,  the  Greater 
China Region, and ASEAN, the Bank is able to integrate group resources toward serving 
local  customers  and  providing  them  with  a  more  diverse,  better  quality,  and  more 
comprehensive range of financial services.(X)  Treasury serviceExpansionary  measures  introduced  by  central  banks  around  the  world  to  mitigate 
impacts  of  COVID-19  combined  with  the  strengthening  of  the  NTD  presented  great 
challenges to business operation and increased demand for hedging solutions. The Bank 
had capitalized on this development by offering foreign currency hedging instruments 
and exploring commodity and interest rate hedges for customers in need. As for wealth 
management  services,  product  offerings  were  adjusted  in  line  with  the  low  interest 
environment  and  the  current  market  trend,  thus  increasing  spread  income  by  15%  in 
2020.  Changes in the Bank’s organization1.  Domestic wholesale banking channels were reorganized and consolidated into local 
branches, which resulted in the decommissioning of seven regional centers including 
WB North 1, WB North 2, WB North 3, WB Taoyuan-Hsinchu, WB Taichung, WB 
Tainan, and WB Kaohsiung.2.  The Wealth Management Strategy and Development Department was consolidated 
into the Wealth Management Product Department, and eventually renamed Wealth 
Management Department.  Budget executionThe Bank achieved 111.76% of its NT$2,321.1 billion deposit target and 103.07% of its 
NT$1,589.9  billion  loan  target  (including  revolving  credit  on  credit  cards;  mainly 
attributed to an adjustment of loan structure) in 2020. In terms of credit cards, the Bank 
achieved 100.83% of its 7.06 million card target.6Unit: NT$ hundred millionBusiness activities2020 - actual2020 - targetAchievement rateDeposit25,94023,211111.76%Credit (including revolving

depth  of  services  provided,  the  competitiveness  of  products  offered,  customer 
satisfaction, quality of credit assets, and overall reputation.An enterprise banking system called GlobalMyB2B has been launched to support 
a  digital  cash  flow  ecosystem,  and  currently  serves  enterprise  customers  in  Taiwan, 
Hong Kong, and China. An enterprise mobile banking system with accompanying APP 
will  also  be  introduced  in  the  future  to  help  enterprise  customers  manage  capital  at 
greater efficiency.With respect to payment service, a new Payment Hub was introduced as a fast and 
secure way for merchants to manage their digital wallets. The hub is complete with a 
payment  gateway  that  supports  all  online-to-offline  (O2O)  payment  applications  and 
scenarios that a merchant may require. By promoting digital wallets in coordination with 
merchants’  services,  the  Bank  is  able  to  obtain  large  volumes  of  consumption  and 
transaction data and introduce differentiated services that are centered around customers’ 
needs for stronger attachment.In light of how financial technologies have evolved in the digital era, the Bank has 
responded with a series of enhanced cybersecurity protections including optimization of 
external  platforms,  internal  software/hardware  renewal,  full  upgrade  of  computer 
systems,  adoption  of  new  “security  protection  mechanism,”  and  restricting  laptop 
connections to the Intranet to SSL-VPN only. Furthermore, as a solution to the shortage 
of  equipment  capacity  and  increasing  frequency  and  time  of  firmware  changes  in  the 
Bank’s  data  center  IaaS  (Infrastructure  as  a  Service)  platform,  the  Bank  is  currently 
planning  a  high  availability  architecture  with  more  equipment  of  higher  capacity  and 
increased transfer rate.7  Revenue, expense, and profitability analysisUnit: NT$ millions, %Year20202019ItemNet interest incomeNet income other than interestTotal net revenuesLoan loss, commitment and guarantee

wealth  management  service,  the  Bank  aims  to  introduce  new  investment  products  by 
combining  group  resources  with  market  research,  including  private  or  customized 
financial  products  for  high-net-worth  customers.  Meanwhile,  the  Bank  will  actively 
improve the professional capacity of its financial advisors and help them transition into 
financial  consultants  for  more  productive  management  of  customers’  assets.  Digital

diverse and efficient foreign currency services, the Bank aims to increase the efficiency 
of customers’ capital allocation as well as their attachment to the Bank’s services, which 
ultimately  improves  the  Bank’s  competitiveness  in  the  international  market  and 
generates  revenue.  The  Bank  will  promote  its  trade  financing  services  by  exploring 
customers and cross-selling products needed for customers’ operating accounts through

Bank’s  competitive  advantage  and  maximizes  product/service  revenues,  but  also 
supports an ecosystem of new businesses.(VIII) Transaction acquisition service:Transaction acquisition service has reached economy of scale given the large number of 
merchants registered for the service. Externally, the Bank will continue to improve the 
capacity  of  its  sales  team  while  securing  and  expanding  presence  in  viable  markets; 
internally,  the  Bank  will  undergo  active  digital  transformations  and  progressively 
introduce automated transaction acquisition systems to reduce labor costs while at the 
same time enhance the quality of service to merchants.9(IX)  ATM service:In addition to cooperating with strategic channels and helping branches shift transaction

products. Meanwhile, the Bank aims to incorporate financial services seamlessly into 
daily  business  scenarios  and  progressively  transform  into  a  digital  consultant  for 
businesses, and shall replicate its successful experience to other overseas locations.(XII) Overseas operations:local  customers  and  businesses,  enhancing  cross-borderA significant amount of attention will be directed toward expansion and product offering 
in  Greater  China  and  ASEAN  markets.  In  Southeast  Asia,  the  Bank  will  focus  on 
growing 
integration, 
introducing  trade  financing,  treasury  and  structured  financing  solutions,  and  making 
improvements  to  the  online  banking  platform  so  that  a  greater  number  of  corporate 
customers may access the quality cross-border and cash management services we have 
to offer. As for the Greater China market, Hong Kong Branch shall maintain a balanced 
focus toward corporate banking, treasury and  wealth management, while fulfilling its 
role as a regional coordinator. The mainland subsidiary will strive to meet the eligibility 
requirements  for  new  financial  products  and  services  by  improving  business  strength 
and raising the level of digitalization, while at the same time cooperate with Hong Kong 
Branch and other overseas units on domestic  as well as foreign businesses at a higher 
level.(XIII) Private banking:The Bank will continue offering customized portfolio management service and a diverse 
range  of  financial  products,  and  leverage  the  Bank’s  professional  wealth  transfer 
consultancy services, external partners, and the trust 2.0 program to further complete the 
Cathay as a service (CaaS) service ecosystem. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Branch will 
continue  to  provide  private  banking  and  wealth  management  services  to  Taiwanese 
businesses  as  well  as  local  customers,  offering  alternative  long-term  investment 
solutions to high-net-worth individuals. The Singapore Branch, on the other hand, will 
establish its own private banking segment to support asset planning and allocation for 
Taiwanese  businesses  seeking  to  expand  into  Southeast  Asia,  and  complement  its 
counterparts in Taiwan and Hong Kong to create a regional private banking platform.10(XIV)  Treasury service:For treasury service, emphasis will be placed on refining the sales process, enhancing 
end-to-end  sales  coordination,  exploring  active  customers  with  real  needs,  promoting 
foreign  currency/commodity/interest  rate  hedges 
to  corporate  customers,  and 
introducing online derivatives trading services.  Expected business targets and basis of estimate2021 business targetsUnit: NT$ hundred millionMain business categoryTargetDepositCredit (including revolving credit on credit cards)26,31417,879Credit card (outstanding cards)7.6 million cardsBasis of targetThe Bank prepares its budget in a manner that achieves optimal allocation of capital. 
To achieve this purpose, the Bank evaluates market outlook, economic cycle and interest 
rate  trends  for  the  coming  year  before  the  end  of  each  year  in  order  to  determine 
business-related  factors.  The  management  then  makes  assumptions  by  taking  into 
consideration product profitability in previous years and possible growth opportunities 
before  setting  growth  targets  and  interest  rates  for  the  coming  year. With  the  growth 
forecast in place, the Bank is able to review budgeted expenses and loan loss provisions.  Key policiesFaced with changes in local and overseas markets and challenges from online-only 
banks and other non-conventional financial institutions, the Bank will continue adhering 
to rules of the authority and explore ways to improve capital efficiency and yield. The 
bank will also make better use of group resources to expand digital and data capacity 
and apply new technologies to the front, mid, and back offices to help the Bank expand 
banking  scenarios  and  deliver  higher  value-adding  services  to  customers,  thereby 
accomplishing operational goals.。In  order  to  support  future  growth  and  realize  the  vision  of  becoming  “the  top 
performer  in Asia  Pacific,”  the  Company  will  continue  making  improvements  to  its 
organization,  recruiting  talents  of  various  expertise  and  skills,  and  enforcing  proper 
management,  communication,  and  culture  to  inspire  “Integrity,  Accountability  and 
Innovation”  within  employees,  and  provide  the  foundation  and  energy  needed  for 
transformation.11IV.  Future strategies(I)  Consumer banking service1.  Make  flexible  capital  allocations  in  line  with  compliance,  risk  management,  and 
business  expansion  needs;  adjust  asset  structure  for  maximum  yield  on  capital 
utilization.2.  Expand  the  financial  ecosystem  to  connect  with  customers’  lifestyles.  Combine 
physical and digital channels for more efficient customer relationship management 
and  cross-selling;  optimize  the  service  process,  address  disruptions,  and  provide 
customers  with  more  convenient  and  better  digital  service  experience  across  all 
channels.3.  Apply  data-mining  techniques  and  analyze  customers’  information  collected 
through different channels for better understanding of customers’ requirements, so 
that  the  right  products/services  can  be  offered  at  the  right  time  through  the  right 
channel.4.  Offer diverse range of integrated financial products to facilitate transfer of customerrelations within group and maximize synergy in the use of group resources.5.  Enhance the value of services offered at branches; free up human resources through 
ongoing  centralization  of  banking  operations  and  the  introduction  of  complete 
digital  services;  offer  differentiated  financial  services  in  line  with  adjustments  to 
branch lobby and service models.6.  Optimize physical and digital channels from a customer experience perspective, and 
strengthen relationship with customers through more user-friendly and convenient 
services;  direct  business  efforts  toward  high  potential  customers  and  high-margin 
products for increased revenue contribution, improved operational performance and 
higher customer value.7.  As the world transitions into the digital era, the Bank will redesign its online banking 
App into a “group digital platform” where subsidiaries may refer customers to each 
other,  introduce  new  financial  products  and  services  with  the  support  of  group 
resources,  and  co-manage  target  customers  while  giving  them  a  comprehensive 
range of financial services to choose from.(II)  Corporate banking serviceThe Bank plans to enforce a new professional, centralized, and localized business model 
where  a  dedicated  wholesale  banking  team  will  be  assembled  to  target  customers  of 
certain  size  and  industry,  and  focus  on  diversifying  service  activities,  increasing  fee 
revenues of low capital requirement, and adjusting earnings structure. Furthermore, the 
Bank will continue making optimal use of available channel resources and strengthen 
cooperation between sales roles to deliver full range of financial service. The Bank will 
also  capitalize  on  the  opportunities  to  cross-sell  between  business  owners,  family 
members,  and  employees  for  overall  performance  improvement  across  the  wholesale 
banking channel.12(III)  Wealth management service1.  Given  the  low  interest  environment,  the  Bank  will  focus  on  structuring  new 
investment products and strategies by making optimal use of resources within and 
outside  the  organization.  For  high-net-worth  customers,  differentiated  and 
customized  products  and  services  will  be  structured  to  satisfy  customers’  diverse 
needs.2.  An Investment Decision Office will be created to consolidate internal and external 
market  studies,  select  investment  products,  provide  customers  with  precise  and 
timely  investment  information  and  recommendations,  and  ultimately  improve 
customers’ end-to-end experience.3.  Financial  advisors  will  be  given  more  intensive  training  to  improve  consultative 
selling skills, the ability to understand customers’ needs, as well as the knowledge 
required  to  propose  appropriate  investment  solutions  and  manage  assets  for 
customers, which ultimately brings value to wealth management services.4.  In  light  of  the  low  interest  environment  and  tightened  insurance  regulations,  the 
insurance  portfolio  will  be  adjusted  with  greater  emphasis  towards  protection-
oriented  and  investment-linked  products.  Improvements  will  also  be  made  to  the 
digital insurance application process for better customer satisfaction, with effective 
controls taken for the monitoring of operational risks.(IV)  Trust service1.  In  response  to  aging  demographics  and  increase  in  wealth  transfer  needs,  an 
innovative trust platform offering diverse and complete asset planning solutions and 
investment instruments will be created to help customers structure customized and 
flexible  trusts  for  retirement  and  wealth  transfer,  and  help  business  customers 
increase welfare for their employees.2.  Real estate trust services will be offered to support the government’s urban renewalefforts and promote reconstruction of shoddy/old buildings.3.  Engage  top-performing  investment  trust  companies  to  hold  custody  of  public 
(private) funds, and promote custodian service for investment-linked insurance and 
discretionary investment accounts.(V)  Foreign currency serviceMore complete range of foreign currency products will be offered and further upgrades 
will  be  made  to  the  SWIFT  system  to  deliver  safer,  faster  and  more  convenient 
remittance services to customers local and abroad. The Bank will be cooperating with 
channel  partners  to  cross-sell  trade  financing  and  cash  flow  solutions,  and  thereby 
complete  the  range  of  foreign  currency  products  offered.  Through  optimization  of 
foreign exchange platform, integration of physical and virtual channels and introduction 
of  diverse  foreign  currency  services,  the  Bank  aims  to  increase  the  efficiency  of 
customers’ capital allocation as well as their attachment to the Bank’s services, which 
ultimately improves the Bank’s competitiveness in the market.13(VI)  Credit card service1.  A  data-driven  approach  and  end-to-end  optimizations  will  be  undertaken  for 
customer relationship management, whereas internal and external resources will be 
combined into creating a customer experience-oriented digital platform that not only 
extends the Bank’s competitive advantage and maximizes product/service revenues, 
but also supports an ecosystem of new businesses.2.  Through  integration  of  group  resources  and  strategic  alliance  with  partners  from 
different industries, the Bank hopes to create an ecosystem of financial services that 
addresses customers’ every need. With the help of data-driven innovations, the Bank 
aims  to  create  collaborative  opportunities  with  industry  partners  and  expand 
financial service scenarios for a total upgrade in customer experience. By gaining 
insight  into  customers’  needs  and  behaviors, a  full  set  of  segmentation  and  brand 
marketing  strategies  can  be  formulated  to  maximize  yields  of  the  organization’s 
precision marketing efforts.3.  Taking advantage of its modularized and agile operations, the Bank will cooperate 
with  merchants  to  create  a  common  platform  where  data  is  used  to  provide 
differentiated services and to direct marketing resources to viable customers for the 
maximum yield.(VII) Payment service1.  Transaction  acquisition  service:  Transaction  acquisition  has  reached  economy  of 
scale given the large number of merchants registered for the service. Externally, the 
Bank  will  continue  to  improve  the  capacity  of  its  sales  team  while  securing  and 
expanding  presence  in  viable  markets;  internally,  the  Bank  will  undergo  active 
digital 
transaction 
acquisition systems to reduce labor costs while at the same time enhance the quality 
of service to merchants.transformations  and  progressivelyintroduce  automated2.  New  payment:  New  payment  tools  give  rise  to  broader  range  of  financial 
applications,  and  depending  on  the  characteristics  of  the  channel  partner  new 
financial solutions may be developed to meet the needs of different customers.3.  Automated channels: Adhere to the “customer experience” focus, enhance cash flow 
services in ways that improve business performance, and create the optimal platform 
for serving customers.(VIII) Overseas operations1.  The Bank will aim to expand its customer base overseas through active deployment 
of overseas channels, planning, training overseas talent, implementation of robust 
platform and procedures, and offering differentiated and diverse products.2.  Given  the  ongoing  pandemic  and  fluctuations  in  global  markets,  overseas  offices 
will have to adopt differentiated operating strategies depending on the nature of the 
local industry, whereas the Head Office will also commit additional investments into 
operating  procedures,  risk  management,  digital 
talent 
development,  thereby  taking  progressive  steps  toward  becoming  the  leading 
financial institution in Asia Pacific.infrastructure,  and3.  Pro-active steps will be taken to strengthen the internal control system in particular 
regard to compliance, anti-money laundering, cybersecurity, and risk management,14while adopting “automated, high efficiency, and intelligent risk controls” to ensure 
optimal  capital  structure.  Furthermore,  a  multinational  customer  management 
system (PAM/SAM) will be adopted to take full advantage of  group resources as 
well as the Bank’s competitive advantage and synergies between overseas offices 
for  cross-border  relationship  management.  In  the  meantime,  overseas  offices  will 
continue building local relations and contribute to the Bank’s visibility and presence 
in  the  global  market;  in  countries  where  Taiwanese  enterprises  are  dominant  in 
numbers,  the  Bank  has  assembled  local  teams  to  consolidate  and  address  needs 
exclusively for them.V.  Impacts of the competitive environment, regulatory environment, andoverall business environment(I)  External competitionPresident Biden’s inauguration opens up negotiation between China and the USA 
and brings hope to ending the ongoing trade barriers. The bilateral investment agreement 
between the EU and China was finalized at the end of 2020 and is expected to take effect 
in early 2022. The EU has approved the UK’s exit, effective from 2021 onwards. There 
remains a large number of political uncertainties that may affect investment and trade 
prospects in the future, and considering the level of expansionary monetary and fiscal 
measures undertaken by Taiwan, the USA, Europe, Japan, and Korea, and the European 
Central  Bank’s  decisions  to  purchase  additional  debts  and  extend  TLTRO  (Targeted 
longer-term refinancing operations), the market should expect further inflow of liquidity. 
Furthermore, resurgence of COVID-19 poses additional uncertainty, and while vaccine 
development  has  been  successful  and  the  world’s  developed  nations  are  hopeful  of 
vaccinating  more  than  50%  of  population  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  the  effect  of 
vaccines against virus mutation remains unclear, and the rate of economic recovery may 
be limited until herd immunity is achieved.The  pandemic  combined  with  low-interest  policy  has  raised  the  market’s  risk 
preference  and  brought  additional  volatility  to  financial  indices.  Furthermore,  disease 
controls  introduced  in  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  have  changed  people’s 
lifestyles and spending habits in ways that increased demand for online banking service. 
As  online-only  banks  commence  operations,  they  inevitably  intensify  competition 
within the wealth management segment.Meanwhile,  the  Central  Bank  introduced  four  major  credit  controls  in  2020  that 
increased  barriers  for  real  estate  lending,  whereas  the  FSC  plans  to  introduce  the 
responsibility  mapping  system  from  abroad  for  enhanced  supervision  over  fraud; 
overall,  the  regulatory  environment  is  becoming  more  rigorous  than  ever.  Domestic 
demand should continue to be the main driver in 2021 given the low base of comparison, 
and as private investment and output strengthen, outlook of the economy should turn 
favorable.  However,  the  global  supply  chain  is  still  undergoing  adjustments,  and  the 
RCEP scheduled to take effect by 2021 year-end at the earliest will cause global supply 
chains  to  shift  towards Asia  Pacific,  and  pose  a  certain  level  of  stress  on  Taiwan’s 
industries.Taiwan  has  abundant  liquidity  in  its  financial system,  but  local  banks  have  been 
operating  in  an  environment  characterized  by  low  margin,  over-competition,  and15excessive competitors for extended periods of time. To prevent engaging in all-out price 
competition, the Bank continues to innovate with the help of digital tools and strives to 
provide business customers with financial services that address a wide range of needs. 
This effort is further supported with tightened control over credit position and limited 
capital,  which  enable  the  Bank  to  grow  while  maintaining  sound  asset  quality  and 
consistent revenues.Digital  banking  service  have  changed  conventional  banking  and  marketing 
practices, and fueled the growth of virtual channels to the extent that physical branches 
are being forced to undergo transformation. Today, it is necessary for banks to invest 
into  the  creation  of  an  online  banking  environment  and  to  guide  branches  toward 
transformation, while at the same time cater for customers’ experience and transaction 
security.  Technologies  have  already  changed  the  ways  of  the  financial  industry,  and 
uprise  of  virtual  and  cloud-based  services  is  believed  to  disrupt  the  competitive 
landscape even further, making FinTech companies the primary competitor.World Economic Forum (WEF) mentioned in its “Global Risks Report 2020” that 
“Environmental Risks” have emerged to become one of the five most likely risks for the 
first time in nearly 15 years. Today, growth and strategies of the world’s businesses are 
influenced by “green finance” to such a high degree that financial service providers will 
have  to  shift  their  investment  focus  towards  zero  emission  projects.  Furthermore, 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks will have to be taken into account as 
part  of  their  credit  assessment  and  supervision  efforts,  and  by  exerting  financial 
influence, financial institutions will play their roles in helping customers mitigate ESG 
impacts and promote sustainability in the business world.(II)  The regulatory environmentThe Bank conducts security assessment of all computer systems used in domestic 
and overseas offices, and makes the necessary improvements to enhance security and 
conform with regulatory requirements. An independent consultant has been engaged to 
evaluate  information  security  for  the  entire  bank  for  the  year,  and  the  outcome  of 
evaluation, along with Statement of Information Security, are presented to the board of 
directors in the first quarter of the following year. By incorporating information security 
into the corporate culture, the Bank enforces and improves security protection through 
the entire organization.The Bank has internal policies, internal control measures, training programs and 
compliance self-assessment practices in place to address key issues such as fair customer 
treatment,  anti-money  laundering,  counter  terrorism  financing,  corporate  social 
responsibilities etc. for compliance with external regulations. Compliance awareness is 
being promoted to all employees within the Bank, and all issues relevant to the Bank’s 
operations are covered by internal control and compliance systems.In terms of financial supervision, financial institutions continue to face challenges 
from the introduction of new regulatory requirements, including AML, CTF, and related 
monitoring  procedures.  While  the  arrival  of  three  online-only  banks  helps  stimulate 
development and application of new financial technologies (particularly AI), they also 
bring new risks and challenges that force financial institutions to enhance cybersecurity, 
tighten risk management, and make use of supervisory tools for corporate governance,16risk management, and compliance purposes, and take pro-active steps toward reducing 
business risks, improving operational health, and adopting international standards.Below is an explanation of enhanced internal  controls undertaken in response toFSC’s new insurance regulatory measures: FSC’s new insurance regulatory measures1.  Prevention  against  embezzlement  of  policyholders’  funds  by  insurance  sales 
representatives: systematic checks (such as KYE on insurance sales representatives, 
control  and  auditing  of  insurance  transactions)  will  have  to  be  developed  and 
implemented.2.  Amendment  of  insurance  solicitation  rules:  tightened  control  on  insuranceapplications from customers aged 65 and above.3.  Life  and  non-life  insurance  representatives  are  required  to  undergo  external 
compliance training on a yearly basis after registration. The Bank regularly assigns 
sales representatives to complete online courses at Taiwan Insurance Institute. Amendments to product design rules and impact on product offering1.  Tightened  regulations  on  investment-linked  policies  with  guaranteed  payouts:  ahigher expense ratio affects the offering of investment-linked policies.2.  Use of the 6th Mortality Table: premiums will increase for survival type products.3.  Expected  reduction  of  liability  reserve:  traditional  products  will  see  a  rise  inpremiums. Internal control enhancement measures1.  Tightened management of personal data and documents.2.  Enforcement of fair customer treatment principles in the compensation system.3.  Tightened control for insurance purchases that are funded by loan or proceeds fromtermination of another insurance policy or time deposit.4.  Enhanced KYC process and monitoring of abnormal transactions for the protectionof customers’ interest.5.  For  compliance  with  new  regulations,  systematic  processes  and  checks  will  beimplemented for new non-life insurance applications in the future.(III)  The overall business environmentOutbreak  of  COVID-19  in  2020  has  had  significant  impacts  on  industrial  and 
economic activities around the world, and presented financial institutions with immense 
challenges, both local and abroad. The effects it had on the supply chain and demands 
have  increased  credit  default  risk  for  banks.  Although  the  government  of  Taiwan 
responded with relief measures and interest rate cuts in line with Europe and USA, the 
ongoing  spread  of  COVID-19  still  presents  financial  institutions  with  additional 
liquidity  risk  and  credit  risk,  and  undermines  confidence  of  local  investors  and 
consumers, as well as the growth of Taiwan’s economy.As a response to the turbulent market conditions and future growth challenges, the 
Bank will direct more attention towards offering investment products that conform with17market trends and customers’ needs and improving the professionalism of its financial 
advisors,  while  at  the  same  time  promote  health-  and  investment-related  solutions  to 
help customers diversify and allocate assets against increased volatility.Growth  of  the  global  economy  has  slowed  down  due  to  negative  effects  of  the 
pandemic, and given the downside risks of deflation and worldwide trade dispute, banks 
will have to adapt to operating in an undesirable environment. The Bank will strive to 
maintain  consistency  of  its  business  performance,  bring  more  complete  financial 
services  and  account  features  to  customers,  secure  deposit  source,  and  optimize 
customer experience. The Bank also aims to develop integrated investment solutions for 
customers  with  special  needs,  and  take  advantage  of  group  synergy  by  cross-selling 
them  through  subsidiaries  online  as  well  as  offline  to  maximize  synergy  and  sustain 
business growth.VI.  Credit ratingInstitution for credit ratingTaiwan RatingsStandard & Poor’sMoody’sRating ReceivedLong-termShort-termtwAA+twA-1+A-A2A-2Prime-1Rating

Bank”  (UWCCB)  and  “Cathay  Commercial  Bank.”  The  former  of  the  founding  members 
(UWCCB)  was  founded  in  September  1971  during  the  4th  Cathay  Financial Association 
Gathering,  where  members  and  overseas  Chinese  leaders  representing  Chinese  businesses 
from 17 countries and regions worldwide gathered and founded a new banking establishment 
out of commitment to supporting economic growth in the home country, with all 17 members 
of The Bankers Association of Taipei each contributing 50% of capital. During the founders’ 
meeting held in May 1974, a resolution was passed to set share capital at US$12 million; 50% 
of which was allocated to domestic shareholders while another 50% was allocated to overseas 
shareholders. In December 1974, the Executive Yuan approved UWCCB’s license application 
submitted  through  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  UWCCB  later  commenced  official  business 
activities on May 20, 1975 at No. 10 Yongsui Street, Taipei City. On April 17, 1995, UWCCB 
merged “Overseas Chinese Trust and Investment Co., Ltd.” into its organization.The latter of the founding members (Cathay Commercial Bank) was initially founded as 
“First  Trust  and  Investment  Co.,  Ltd.”  in  June  1971.  The  board  re-election  held  in  1993 
elected Mr. Chen-Yu Tsai as the chairman of First Trust and Investment, who introduced a “5-
year  transformation  program”  that  successfully  re-organized  the  institution  into  “Huitong 
Commercial Bank Co., Ltd.” on November 16, 1998. On July 3, 2002, Huitong Commercial 
Bank Co., Ltd. was renamed “Cathay Commercial Bank.”As a response to ongoing changes such as the government’s financial reform initiative, 
the  implementation  of  Financial  Holding  Company Act  and  intensifying  competition  from 
financial  conglomerates  after  joining  the  World  Trade  Organization,  Cathay  Commercial 
Bank and UWCCB joined Cathay Financial Group and became 100%-owned subsidiaries of 
Cathay  Financial  Holding  Co.,  Ltd.  (Cathay  FHC)  on April  22  and  December  18,  2002, 
respectively,  to  provide  more  complete  financial  services  to  a  wider  range  of  customers. A 
decision was later made to merge UWCCB and Cathay Commercial Bank according to The 
Financial  Institutions  Merger  Act  and  related  laws,  with  UWCCB  being  the  surviving 
company  and  Cathay  Commercial  Bank  the  dissolved  company.  Merging  had  a  number  of 
advantages  such  as  integrated  resource,  reduced  cost,  enhanced  performance,  improved 
service and creation of synergy. Terms and details of the merger agreement were passed during 
the board of directors meeting held on April 21, 2003, and were later approved by the Ministry 
of Finance on June 26. The merger baseline date was set on October 27, 2003, from which 
time the surviving entity was renamed Cathay United Bank Co., Ltd.To  ensure  further  growth  in  terms  of  service  scope  and  market  share,  the  Bank  later 
merged with Lucky Bank (January 1, 2007 being the baseline date) and acquired a certain part 
of  assets,  liabilities,  and  business  activities  from  China  United  Trust  &  Investment 
Corporation on December 29, 2007. Following the merger, the Bank was able to increase the 
domestic branch count to 165.19Three.  Corporate Governance ReportI.  Organization: Organization and responsibilities of main departmentsOrganization Chart of Cathay United Bank Co., Ltd.2020.08.21g

in the consolidated financial statements to the Bank’s directors, supervisors, President, 
and Executive Vice Presidents, and their respective proportions to net income, as well 
as the policies, standards, and packages by which they were paid, the procedures through 
which remunerations were determined, and their association with business performance 
and future risks:The sum of remuneration paid to directors, supervisors,  President and Executive Vice 
Presidents in 2020 amounted to NT$326,499,000 (representing 1.49% of net income in 
2020),  down  13.62%  from  the  NT$377,998,000  reported  in  2019.  The  basis  of 
remuneration disclosed above is different from the basis of the Income Tax Act; for this 
reason, the amount has been prepared solely for information disclosure, and not for tax 
purpose.1.  Remuneration to directors, supervisors and managers are determined according to 
the  Bank’s  “Director  and  Supervisor  Compensation  Guidelines”  and  “Manager55Compensation  Guidelines”;  both  policies  have  been  resolved  in  board  meetings. 
Amount of remuneration is decided based on responsibilities, capacity and annual 
performance of each individual, while taking into consideration the benchmark level. 
Both  the  remuneration  policy  and  amount  are  adjusted  according  to  current  and 
future risks and overall business performance to ensure alignment with shareholders’ 
long-term interest.2.  In  the  “Director  and  Supervisor  Compensation  Guidelines”  (referred  to  as  the 
“Guidelines”  below),  a  director’s  compensation  includes  fees,  remuneration,  and 
traffic and other allowances.(1)  Compensation:  The  Bank  maycompensate  directors(including 
Chairman/Vice  Chairman)  who  personally  participate  in  the  execution  of 
business  activities.  The  amount  of  which  is  determined  based  on  level  of 
participation and contribution of individual directors and peer levels, and are 
paid with board of directors’ approval. These directors may also receive bonus 
at managers’ rate depending on annual performance.Compensation for independent directors and external directors appointed by 
the  parent  company  is  evaluated  according  to  rules  of  the  parent  company; 
directors  who  concurrently  assume  managerial  position  within  the  Bank  are 
not entitled to receive director compensation.(2)  Remuneration:  In  profit-making  years,  the  Bank  may  pay  out  no  more  than 
0.1% of earnings as remuneration to directors and supervisors (i.e. the parent 
company).(3)  Transportation  and  other  allowances  are  paid  at  the  standards  stated  in  theGuidelines.3.  The Bank has “Manager Compensation Guidelines” in place that outlines managers’monthly salary, allowance, bonus and retirement benefits.The board of directors of Indovina Bank convenes meetings four times a year. 
Given Indovina Bank’s stature as a Vietnam-registered subsidiary jointly controlled 
by  Industrial  and  Commercial  Bank  of  Vietnam  (50%),  the  Bank  respects  the 
decisions  of  its  Vietnamese  partner  on  related  issues,  including  director 
remuneration, provided that such decisions are fair and do not adversely impact the 
shareholders’ interest.56IV.  Implementation of Corporate Governance:(I)  Operation of the Board of Directors (Table 2)A total of 6 meetings (A) were held in the last year(2020); below are directors’ and

decisions,  the  board’s  composition  and  structure,  election  and  ongoing  education  of  board  members,  and 
enforcement of internal control.(2) Director  individual  performance  assessment:  director’s  awareness  toward  the  Bank’s  goals  and  missions, 
awareness  to  duties, level  of  participation in  the  Bank’s  operations, maintenance  of  internal relations and

duties,  quality  of  committee’s  decisions,  composition  and  member  selection,  and  enforcement  of  internal 
control.IV.  Enhancement to functionality of the board of directors in the current and the most recent 
year  (e.g.  establishment  of  an  Audit  Committee,  improvement  of  information 
transparency, etc.), and the progress of such enhancements.The Bank has undertaken a number of governance enhancement actions in line with the 
corporate  governance  roadmap  published  by  the  Financial  Supervisory  Commission. 
For example: a Corporate Sustainability (CS) task force comprising representatives from 
various  departments  and  offices  has  been  assembled  to  enforce  corporate  social 
responsibilities;  a  corporate  governance  officer  has  been  appointed  to  assist  board 
members with various duties; and changes in regulations are being  monitored closely 
and  reflected  in  internal  policies  in  a  timely  manner  to  support  the  Bank’s  corporate 
governance efforts. Enhancement of board performance  Board  meetings  are  being  held  more  frequently  and  more  efficiently  toaccommodate the Bank’s growing size and businesses.  A  set  of  “Board  of  Directors  and  Functional  Committee  Performance  Evaluation 
Principles”  was  established  in  2018  to  support  the  Bank’s  corporate  governance 
efforts and to improve efficiency of the board and functional committees, based on 
the  ways  they  operate.  Board  performance  evaluation  is  conducted  once  a  year; 
outcomes of the 2020 board performance evaluation have been reported during the 
board meeting held in February 2021, and ongoing efforts will be made to improve 
performance  targets  and  board  efficiency.  Furthermore,  the  Bank  engaged  an 
independent third party to evaluate performance of the board of directors in 2020 
out of concerns for the independence and efficiency of the evaluation process. The 
institution  offers  professional  insight  to  various  aspects  including  corporate 
governance and operations that helps board members supervise more effectively to 
ensure accomplishment of sustainability goals.  During  the  meeting  held  in  March  2019,  the  Bank’s  board  of  directors  passed  a 
resolution  to  appoint  a  “Corporate  Governance  Officer”  to  oversee  corporate

Bank’s primary CS enforcer; the general manager serves as the 
chairman,, whereas the role of executive committee is undertaken 
by the CAO, and Sustainable Banking Section of the International 
Audit Department serves as secretariat. The task force has six 
panels established to promote “responsible investment, responsible 
product, sustainability governance, green operation, employee care, 
and social exclusion.” Together, they work toward fulfilling the 
Bank’s vision of “creating a sustainable future through green 
banking.” The CS Task Force convenes quarterly CS conferences 
to track progress of each panel and to discuss key issues relating to 
CS, which help monitor work progress, resolve obstacles, and 
enforce the Bank’s key initiatives.“Cathay United Bank CS Task Force” makes half-yearly reports to 
the board of directors to explain the Bank’s progress regarding CS 
vision, organization, systems and performance highlights. By 
making transparent disclosures on corporate governance and 
sustainability practice, the Bank strives to fulfill corporate social 
responsibilities while building its reputation as the leader in “green 
banking.” Regular reporting also enhances the board’s strategic 
role in the promotion of corporate social responsibilities and 
enables CS policies to be implemented from the top down, thereby

Analysis  of  location  of  business,  future  market  supply,  demand  and  growth,and competition(1)  SupplyOn top of the pandemic, domestic wealth management services are forced 
to  undergo  digital  transformation  due  to  the  arrival  of  online-only  banks,  as 
they  provide  consumers  with  easier  access  to  financial  services  without  the 
constraint of time or space. Coupled with the fact that the domestic insurance 
market is intensively competitive with an oversupply of highly homogeneous 
products, the Company will place greater emphasis on delivering professional 
services in line with customers’ needs.(2)  Demand and growthThe global financial environment is still under the effect of the pandemic, 
meaning that the low interest environment will persist for an extended time. 
As  vaccines  become  available,  the  world  will  be  looking  forward  to  an 
economic  recovery,  and  given  the  market’s  abundant  liquidity  supply,  there 
has been a shift in preference towards risky assets. This increased demand for 
investments is favorable to the growth of wealth management services.Due  to  restrictions  of  prevailing  laws  and  the  investment  environment, 
the  Company  will  focus  on  promoting  the  protective  features  of  insurance. 
Meanwhile,  customers’  needs  will  have  to  be  analyzed  in  greater  detail  and 
addressed with total asset allocation solutions in order to increase attachment, 
revenue contribution, and product penetration.(3)  Competitive advantageGiven the saturation and high degree of homogeneity within the domestic 
financial market, the Bank will be forming alliances and integrating resources 
with partners from different industries to develop innovative practices that are 
different from traditional banking. With a vast customer base and data analysis 
technologies,  the  Bank  is  able  to  take  the  initiative  in  offering  investment 
solutions  that  meet  customers’  needs,  and  promote  a  healthy  investment 
concept  that  emphasizes  principal  protection  and  asset  appreciation.  By 
assisting customers with total asset allocation and reducing volatility and risks 
of  the  markets  they  invest  in,  the  Bank  is  able  to  earn  customers’  trust  over 
time.The Bank’s overseas market expansion efforts have been largely focused 
on corporate financing and related products, such as: syndicated lending, trade 
financing and cross-border corporate Internet banking; all of which have been 
well-received  by  local  corporate  customers.  Consumer  behaviors  have 
changed to the point where more than 60% of transactions in the target market 
are completed online, and the Bank offers a multitude of digital campaigns in 
the  consumer  banking  segment,  from  iCare  Benefit  (a  salary-based  cash 
lending  service),  Finaxar  Credit  Line  (FCL)  (and  automated  personal  loan 
service),and Cellcard (an innovative  micro loan), that can take advantage of 
this development while at the same time realize its vision towards inclusive 
finance.1362.  Future opportunities, threats, and response strategies(1)  Opportunities, threats, and response strategies in Taiwan  Opportunities①  The  Bank  has  access  to  analytical  talents  and  diversity  of  financial 
products  both  within  and  outside  the  financial  group,  and  has  had  great 
success  delivering  digital  financial  services  to  customers  using  modern 
technologies and a digital platform in recent years. The ongoing pandemic, 
extreme  volatility  of  the  financial  market,  and  investors’  shift  towards 
online  trading  have  presented  the  Bank  with  the  opportunity  to  further 
improve  customer  relations  and  experience  by:  offering  accurate  and 
timely  market  information  and  investment  advice,  optimizing  online 
trading  features,  and  delivering  relevant,  suitable,  and  useful  financial 
services to customers.②  In  addition  to  the  existing  online  insurance  platform,  the  Bank  will 
continue improving its digital security service to provide customers with 
greater digital experience and added value.③  Electronic payment services from leading companies such as Shopee, PX 
Mart, and Familymart are helpful to the growth of the credit card market 
as they contribute additional payment scenarios. Increasing percentage of 
non-cash payments works in favor of creating a payment ecosystem that 
benefits  banks,  merchants,  and  consumers,  whereas  development  of  a 
comprehensive  consumption  data  model  provides  insight  to  customers’ 
spending  habits  and  precise  marketing  is  applied  to  better  satisfy 
customers’ financial needs.④  The  credit  card  market  continues  to  grow  and  consumers  are  already 
accustomed  to  paying  with  plastic  currency.  The  spread  of  COVID-19 
further compelled merchants to accept electronic payment and sell online, 
which creates opportunities of a stronger bond between banks, merchants, 
and consumers. Online transactions also provide abundant data that can be 
analyzed to explore customers’ needs with greater precision.⑤  Mobile payment activities continued to grow throughout Taiwan in 2020 
due to new services introduced by electronic/third-party payment service 
providers and retail chains, which ultimately accelerate market maturity in 
competition..  Intensive  competition  among  mobile  payment  service 
providers should persist in 2021, and through credit card/account linkage, 
the  Bank  expects  to  expand  application  and  broaden  the  reach  of  its 
financial services.⑥  The  Bank  operates  a  broad  network  of  automated  equipment  with 
extensive  customer  coverage.  Future  deregulations  will  open  up 
opportunities for financial service providers to grow.⑦  Outlook of domestic consumption turns strong for 2021, and the central 
bank’s expansionary monetary policy combined with relief and stimulus 
measures should provide adequate support for economic growth. However, 
conservative outlooks published by research institutions around the world 
coupled  with  uncertainties  regarding  the  pandemic,  the  slowdown  in137China’s  growth,  and  U.S.A.–China  trade  conflict,  and  geopolitical  risks 
will all affect the strength of growth. The Bank continues to monitor credit 
risks and industry changes, and offers diverse financial services without 
compromising asset quality as a means to improve business performance.  Threats①  Some  banks  are  offering  new  cards  packaged  with  high  rewards  or 
privileges in an attempt to maintain market share and retain cardholders, 
which  increases  competition  of  the  banking  service.  Meanwhile,  credit 
cards  are  now  used  mostly  as  payment  tools,  and  low  utilization  of  the 
credit function caused a decline in profits.②  The market is saturated with payment solutions and competitors, and fastshifts in payment preference increases equipment acquisition cost.③  Mobile  payment  services  from  competing  platforms  and  incentives 
offered  by  payment  service  providers,  financial  institutions,  and  retail 
chains in an attempt to attract merchants and customers have made it more 
competitive and challenging to collaborate with payment service providers.④  The  financial  market  is  already  overwhelmed  with  information  and 
homogeneous competition among peers; the arrival of online-only banks 
poses an even greater challenge to digital wealth management services.⑤  The  authorities  have  tightened  supervision  over  guaranteed  payment 
products and forced an increased in premiums that may adversely affect 
sales.  It  would  be  more  challenging  to  develop  new  investment-linked 
products that meet customers’ needs.⑥  It is difficult for banks to enjoy excess profit margin due to saturation of 
the domestic financial market and the prevailing low-interest environment. 
Furthermore,  given  the  rapid  changes  in  financial  products  and  the 
banking  environment,  banks  have  to  constantly  adjust  and  adapt,  which 
presents major challenge to future operations.  Response measures①  With the support of big data analysis, the Bank will aim to introduce new 
products  and  campaigns  that  give  consumers  the  option  to  choose 
depending  on  their  needs  and  preferences,  and  in  doing  so  improve 
marketing yields, customer satisfaction, and attachment.②  More  attention  will  be  directed  towards  digitalization  of  product  and 
service  offerings  to  deeply  develop  young    digital  group.  For  this 
category  of  customers,  the  Bank  will  emphasize  on  the  relevance  of 
service to customers’ lifestyles, segment differentiation, innovation, and 
customers’ overall experience and service satisfaction without the use of 
excessive rewards.③  Make  timely  adjustments  in  response  to  the  pandemic,  and  actively 
provide financial services with differentiated and identifiable innovations 
as  means  to  raise  brand  image  and  competitiveness.  Make  early 
preparation  for  post-pandemic  opportunities  and  avoid  succumbing  to 
price competition of the banking industry.138④  Continue collaboration with channel partners and assist them in managing 
member relations; strive to satisfy channel members’ and the Bank’s needs 
while at the same time explore innovative applications.⑤  Continually  provide  financial  advisors  with  new  product  knowledge  as 
well as skills to help customers adjust investment strategies and build up 
a  strong  portfolio;  actively  monitor  customers’  existing  investment 
positions and enhance risk management over customers’ exposures.⑥  Embrace the challenges of digitalized wealth management service with a 
“customer-centric”  philosophy;  design  investment  products  and  wealth 
management  services  with  the  goal  of  delivering  the  best  end-to-end 
transaction experience for customers.⑦  Integrating  across  devices,  platforms  and  physical/virtual  channels, 
provide digital cash flow service and enhance account collection/payment 
functions to become the customers’ primary banker.⑧  Make  optimal  use  of  existing  customer  base  and  physical  channels,  and 
intensify intra-group business referral in ways that improve the depth and 
breadth of relationship with top customers.⑨  The  financial  industry  remains  highly  competitive  whereas  the  nation’s 
first online-only bank is scheduled to begin its trial run in 2021. Given the 
ongoing  changes  in  the  business  environment,  banks  are  compelled  to 
transform  and  adopt  a  higher  level  of  digitalization  and  agility,  which 
gives rise to higher demand for financial data analysts and strategy talents. 
In response, the Bank will continue its talent training efforts and strive to 
secure competitive advantage by exploring new applications for available 
information technologies.(2)  Opportunities, threats, and response strategies in overseas markets  OpportunitiesThe  Bank’s  target  markets  still  presents  significant  business  opportunities 
given  the  upcoming  infrastructures,  high  demographic  dividend,  strong 
growth potentials and favorable conditions.  ThreatsSupervisory  standards  have  tightened  around  the  world,  increasing  overall 
compliance  costs,  whereas  uncertainties  regarding  the  pandemic  ,  the  US–
China  trade  conflict  and  geopolitical  risks  will  all  affect  the  strength  of 
growth.  Response measures①  The ongoing pandemic has reduced GDP growth across the Greater China 
Region  and  ASEAN  members,  and  negatively  impacted  all  professions 
and  industries  around  the  world.  Face  to  this  situation,  The  Bank  takes 
advantage  of  its  expansive  global  network  by  having  overseas  offices 
support, back up, and cooperate with each other for maximal synergy.②  The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly changed people’s working and 
spending  habits.  Faced  with  customers’  desperate  needs  for  financial139service,  the  Bank  has  responded  with  progressive  digitalization  and 
enforced “localization strategies” at offices where the pandemic is better 
controlled.  By  consolidating  resources  across  non-life  insurance,  life 
insurance, banking, and other subsidiaries of the group, projects such as 
data-driven  customer  service,  smart  investment,  automated  process,  and 
Equator Principles-compliant financing have been undertaken to enhance 
product  development  skills  and  satisfy  customer’  needs  with  greater 
precision.  By  consistently  delivering  values  and  experiences  above 
customers’ expectation, the Bank has secured its place as customers’ best 
overseas partner and the leading bank in Asia Pacific.(V)  Research and development of new financial instruments1.

energy development and actively promotes greenhouse gas survey, ISO certification for 
energy  and  environmental  management  systems,  and  carbon  footprint  for  personal 
unsecured  lending  services/products;  these  initiatives  are  duly  enforced  in  various 
aspects of its operations.The Bank was the first in the industry to contribute to the field of art, starting with 
the establishment of Culture and Charity Foundation of the Cathay United Bank in 1980 
followed by the founding of Cathay United Art Center in 2000. Driven by its mission to 
“give  back  to  society,”  the  Bank  has  since  been  active  in  charitable  causes  including 
offering of study aid, charity sponsorship, cultural/arts performance, and consignment 
charity. The Bank is highly committed in fulfilling corporate social responsibilities. It 
organizes charity events through Cathay United Bank Foundation, and a list of major 
events organized by the Foundation in 2020 is presented as follows:1.  “Elevated Tree Program－  Grow A Big Tree From A Shoot” series:①  Elevated Tree Program Scholarship:In April  and  October,  the  Foundation  made  2  donations  under  the  Elevated 
Tree Program totaling NT$10 million. These donations were intended to cover 
tuition fees for students from financially disadvantaged families and those who 
fell victim to tragic events. Donations were made to 963 elementary and junior 
high  schools  in  Miaoli  County,  Yunlin  County,  Chiayi  County,  Pingtung 
County, Taitung County, and Yilan County to a total of 7,432 beneficiaries.②  Donation of “charity coats” in collaboration with business:Chairman Jin-Zhu Shen of Ever Shine Y&F and Chairman Shu-Li Yeh of Ever

the previous year. The new venue offers more than 300 square meters of floor 
space,  thereby  allowing  visitors  to  approach  and  admire  the  beauty  of  art 
comfortably up close. While many exhibitions were postponed in 2020 due to 
the  pandemic,  Cathay  United  Art  Center  still  organized  9  exhibitions  of148varying  themes  including  oil  painting,  calligraphy,  and  sculpture,  and  three

trigger  for  charitable  actions,  the  art  center  hopes  to  inspire  kindness  and 
beauty in everyone.②  “Art Talk Lectures” held at Cathay United Art Center:Driven by the mission to promote art education, Cathay United Art Center had 
been  hosting  free  sessions  of  “Art  Talk  Lecture”  at  night.  The  number  of 
sessions organized this year was reduced to 3 due to the pandemic, and during 
these three sessions, Director Chun-Lan Liu of Taoyuan Museum of Fine Arts 
was invited to speak on “The Three Lessons of Visual Art.” Through these free 
seminars,  the  art  center  hoped  to  provide  the  public  with  the  opportunity  to 
learn about arts and attract more people to art and cultural exhibitions.③  Charity auction of specially designed calendar:In 2020, Cathay United Art Center created a calendar that comprised artworks 
of 10 artists, including Hsien-Fa Su. With this calendar, the art center hoped to 
bring art into people’s lives and promote a sense of joy and warm atmosphere.

Standalone 
1. 
2.[Asset growth rate] increased: Mainly attributed to a NT$105.5 billion increase (about 7.09%) in “Discounts and loans” as of the end of 2020.[Profit growth rate] decreased: Mainly attributed to a NT$1.5 billion increase (about 32.84%) in “Loan loss expense and guara ntee liability provision” in 2020 compared to 2019, which reduced 
net profit before tax. 
[Cash flow ratio], [cash flow adequacy ratio], and [cash flow coverage ratio] decreased: Due to negative growth in net cash i nflow (outflow) from operating activities in 2020 compared to 2019.3. 
Consolidated: 
1.[Interest expense as a % of yearly average deposit balance] decreased: Mainly due to a reduction in the market interest rate  combined with a NT$184.691 billion increase (about 8%) in deposit 
balance in 2020.2. 
3.4.[Asset growth rate] increased: Mainly attributed to a NT$108.1 billion increase (about 6.96%) in “Discounts and loans” as of the end of 2020. 
[Profit growth rate] decreased: Mainly attributed to a NT$2.7 billion increase in “Loan loss expense and guarantee liability  provision” in 2020 compared to 2019, which reduced net profit before 
tax. 
[Cash flow ratio], [cash flow adequacy ratio], and [cash flow coverage ratio] decreased: Due to negative growth in net cash i nflow (outflow) from operating activities in 2020 compared to 2019.*  Companies that prepare standalone financial statements are also required to provide financial analysis on a standalone basis. 
*  Companies that prepare IFRS-compliant financial information for less than 5 years are also required to complete Table (2) below and report financial information using financial accounting standardsof the R.O.C.Note 1:  Data from 2016 to 2020 have been audited and certified by the independent auditors. 
Note 2:  As of the publication date of this annual report, no financial information of 2021 had been audited or reviewed by CPAs. 
Note 3:  Formulas of various analyses are defined below:1.  Operational ability(1)  Deposit to loan ratio = total loan / total deposit 
(2)  NPL ratio = total non-performing loan / total loan 
(3)  Interest expense as a % of yearly average deposit balance = total interest expense on deposits / yearly average deposit balance 
(4)  Interest revenue as a % of yearly average loan balance = total interest revenue from loans / yearly average loan balance 
(5)  Total assets turnover = net profit/average total assets 
(6)  Revenues per employee (Note 7) = net revenue / total employees 
(7)  Average earnings per employee = corporate earnings / total number of employees2.  Profitability(1)  Return on tier 1 capital = profit before tax / average tier 1 capital. 
(2)  Return on assets = after-tax profit / average total assets. 
(3)  Return on equity = after-tax profit / average total shareholders’ equity. 
(4)  Net profit margin = corporate earnings/net income162(5)  Earnings per share (EPS) = (attributable to shareholders’ equity of the parent – preferred stock dividends) / weighed average quantity of outstanding shares. (Note 5)3.  Financial structure(1)  Debt to asset ratio = total liabilities / total assets. 
(2)  Property, plant, and equipment to equity ratio = net property, plant and equipment / net shareholders’ equity.4.  Growth rate (%)(1)  Asset growth rate = (total assets in current year – total assets in previous year) / total assets in previous year. 
(2)  Profitability growth rate = (earnings before taxation in current year – earnings before taxation in previous year) / earnings before taxation in previous year.5.  Cash flows (Note 8)(1)  Cash flow ratio = net cash flow from operating activities / (interbank borrowing and overdraft + commercial papers payable +  financial liability at fair value through income statement+ RP bill and bond liabilities + accruals payable within one year).(2)  Net cash flow adequacy ratio = net cash flows from operating activities in the last five years / (capital expenditure + cash  dividend) in the last five years. 
(3)  Cash flow coverage ratio = net cash flow from operation / net cash flow from investment.6.  Liquidity reserve ratio = liquid assets mandated by The Central Bank / mandatory liquidity reserves. 
7.  Scale of operation(1)  Market share of assets = total assets / total assets of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activities (Note 6) 
(2)  Market share of net worth = net worth / total net worth of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activities 
(3)  Market share of deposits = total deposit / total deposit of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activities 
(4)  Market share of loans = total loan / total loan of all financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan related activitiesNote 4:  Total liabilities are net of provisions for guarantees and accidental losses. 
Note 5:  Attention to the following is required when the aforementioned equations for the calculation of EPS are applied to assessment:1.  The weighted average quantity of outstanding common shares shall be used as the standard, not the quantity of outstanding shares at the end of the year. 
2.  In case of raising capital through issuing new shares or transactions of treasury stocks, calculate also the weighted average quantity of outstanding shares in the period of circulation. 
3.  In case of capitalization of retained earnings or capitalization of capital surplus into new shares, adjustment shall be made in retrospect to the size of capitalization for each instance whencalculating the earnings per shares annually or semi-annually. The time of issuance can be neglected.4.  If the preferred shares are non-convertible accumulated preferred shares, the dividend declared in current period (whether paid or unpaid) shall be deducted from corporate earnings or asaddition to earnings after taxation.5.  If the accumulated preferred shares are not accumulative in nature, dividend for preferred shares shall be deducted from corporate earnings, if any. In case of loss, no adjustment shall bemade.Note 6:  Financial institutions eligible to perform deposit and loan-related activities include local banks, Taiwanese branches of Mainland banks, Taiwanese branches of foreign banks, credit cooperativeassociations, and credit departments of farmers / fishermen associations.Note 7:  Revenue refers to the sum of interest and non-interest revenues. 
Note 8:  The cash flow analysis takes into account the following:1.  Net cash flow from operating activities is taken from the amount of net cash flow from operating activities presented in the  cash flow statement. 
2.  Capital expenditure refers to the amount of annual cash outflow for capital investments. 
3.  Cash dividends include cash dividends to both common shares and preferred shares. 
4.  Gross property, plant, and equipment refers to the amount before deducting accumulated depreciation.163Capital adequacy ratioUnit: NT$ thousandYearCapital adequacy ratio for the most recent yearAnalysis Item20202019201820172016ConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneConsolidatedStandaloneCapitalCommon share equity212,526,568204,572,808193,317,039186,226,591173,805,139166,969,563151,860,690149,392,107145,012,403142,855,418Tier 1 non-common share equity33,205,55327,227,00733,059,26127,099,09334,304,20628,371,34333,690,07331,871,91720,424,62018,882,425Tier 2 capitalCapital58,452,82745,000,99561,447,60648,554,79764,789,65951,801,63868,268,77664,210,86855,891,56652,872,412304,184,948276,800,810287,823,906261,880,481272,899,004247,142,544253,819,539245,474,892221,328,589214,610,255Standardized approach1,513,501,089  1,393,921,824    1,546,548,347  1,458,022,891  1,525,409,836  1,445,220,093  1,373,772,064  1,315,254,831  1,390,674,252  1,333,208,675Credit

(Analysis is not required for changes of less than 20%) 
Standalone and Consolidated 
[Asset securitization] decreased: Mainly attributed to decreased positions of securitized and re-securitized assets. 
[Operational risk – standardized approach] increased: Mainly attributed to higher required capital for operational risk that FSC has imposed as a penalty for misconduct involving the Bank’s financial advisor. 
[Market risk – standardized approach] decreased: Mainly attributed to lower RWA from general market risk of interest rate and interest rate options calculated using the simplified approach. The Bank adopted the swaptransaction advanced approach and the Swaption Delta Plus approach in 2020, which resulted in a lower amount of RWA being cal culated using the simplified approach on 
general market risk of interest rates and interest rate options compared to 2019.Note:1.  All financial information from 2016 to 2020 has been verified by CPA. 
2.  Capital, risk-weighted assets and total risk exposure shown in this table have been calculated according to “Regulations Governing the Capital Adequacy and Capital Category of Banks” and “Calculation Explanation and Form for Bank Regulatory Capital and Risk-WeightedAssets.”3.  Below are the formulas used for the calculations in this table:(1)  Capital = common share equity + Tier 1 non-common share equity + Tier 2 capital.

accordance with Article 74 of the Banking Act with the authority’s approval, both out of 
business requirement and in support of the government’s economic development plans.

individuals  and  financial  institutions)  becoming  unable  to  fulfill  contractual 
obligations,  which  includes  credit  risks  arising  from  credit  service,  investment 
activities, financial products, and contracts.Credit risk management system2020ItemDetails1. Credit risk strategies,(1)  Strategies: Develop and maintain effective credit riskgoals, policies and

strategies.(2)  Goals: Measure and control credit risks associated withbusiness activities, and aim to maximize risk-adjusted profit 
and shareholders’ value under tolerable risks.(3)  Policy: The Bank adopts a credit risk management system thatdivides responsibilities among departments. The Bank develops 
organization-wide risk management culture and incorporates it 
into daily operations. Through dynamic analysis, the Bank 
constantly assesses risks and undertakes response measures to 
optimize asset quality while ensuring the integrity of its capital 
structure.(4)  Procedures: The Bank complies with business-relatedregulations and implementation rules, and implements levels of 
approval authority to assess and review incoming cases for 
rigorous control of asset quality prior to lending. Through 
credit review and credit reporting, the Bank monitors credit 
conduct of its borrowers or counterparties over the period of 
loan or investment, and undertakes response measures at times 
deemed appropriate. Debt security measures are undertaken as 
soon as possible in the event of the borrower’s or 
counterparty’s default/overdue.The board of directors is the ultimate decision maker for the Bank’s 
credit risk strategies and major risk policies. The Bank has 
independent and specialized departments and functional teams to 
oversee management, planning, execution and control of credit risks 
associated with credit, investment and financial products.The credit risk reporting and assessment system covers credit 
approval procedures, limit management, credit rating, collateral 
information, regular credit review, and NPL management. In 
addition to making ongoing improvements to risk quantification 
technologies and risk assessment models, the Bank also refines its 
stress testing methodology for better control of asset quality, and 
takes precautionary measures as deemed necessary.170Item4. Credit risk avoidance

requirementsDetailsBorrowers and counterparties are regularly analyzed for credit risk 
profil and severity of losses in order to determine appropriate 
measures for risk avoidance or mitigation, including: rejection of 
service, conditional service, collateral or credit guarantee. With the 
help of systems such as interim credit review and collateral 
management, the Bank is able to monitor all types of mitigation 
tools used in business.Standardized approachExposure and accrued capital charge upon risk reduction under credit riskstandardized approachType of Risk ExposureSovereignsNon Central -Government Public Sector

Operational risk management and the required capital.Operational risk refers to the risk of loss attributed to inappropriate or failed 
internal process, personnel error, system malfunction, or external event. It includes 
legal risks but excludes strategy risks and reputation risks.Operational risk management system2020ItemDetailsThe Bank has effective operational risk management 
framework and systems in place to manage banking 
operations, improve efficiency, reduce risk exposure, and 
secure assets. 
Apart from converting operational risk strategies into 
feasible policies and procedures, the Bank also conducts 
operational risk self-assessment, reports operational risk 
incidents, and uses key risk indicators to help identify, 
assess, and monitor risks: 
(1)  Operational risk self-assessment: To identify risksassociated with operational activities as well as the 
underlying cause, control methods and risk exposure, 
and thereby enable response plans.(2)  Operational risk incident reporting: The reporting 
process is triggered whenever an operational risk 
incident occurs, so that the underlying cause can be 
identified, assessed, and discussed for improvement.(3)  Key risk indicators: Develop indicators for thepotential risks identified to facilitate evaluation of 
changes in exposure.The board of directors is the Bank’s ultimate decision-
making authority in regards to operational risk 
management. The risk management framework has 
specialized units established to help plan and implement 
operational risk management system, assist departments in 
the establishment of standard operating procedures, and 
consolidate/analyze/monitor operational risks for the entire 
bank with reports made to the board of directors and senior 
management. The Internal Audit Department is responsible 
for auditing the appropriateness and implementation of 
operational risk management systems by all departments 
within the Bank.The Bank has implemented an operational risk incident 
database, and regularly enforces its operational risk self-
assessment and key risk indicators. Operational risk self-
assessments and key risk indicators are used to classify risk 
exposures into high, medium and low level. Response 
measures have been devised for the different levels of risk1811. Operational riskmanagement strategy

database is tracked, analyzed and reported regularly; 
procedure and system optimizations are proposed based on 
the analysis report.The Bank conducts risk self-assessment prior to launching 
new financial products (including new business categories, 
products and service models). Depending on the extent and 
frequency of exposure impact, the Bank uses insurance and 
engages external parties to mitigate or transfer potential 
exposures. The Bank has business continuity policies and 
rules in place to address risk events that are likely to cause 
disruption to business operations. Drills are conducted 
from time to time to minimize possible losses and improve 
employees’ response. Through regular monitoring, 
management reports and review on the use of tools, the 
Bank is able to ensure the effectiveness of its risk 
avoidance and mitigation tools.4. Operational riskavoidance or mitigation

including: limit control, regular reporting, internal audit 
system, independent monitoring department and executive 
committees to effectively measure and control market risks 
associated with business activities, and to maximize risk-
adjusted profit and shareholders’ value under tolerable 
risks. The Bank has an internal market risk management 
unit that develops relevant guidelines and standards, 
executes market risk management, and prepares 
management information and reports regularly to 
accountable managers for effective management of market 
risk.The board of directors is the Bank’s ultimate decision-
making authority in regards to risk strategy and major risk 
policies. The Bank has a specialized market risk 
management unit that operates independently from the 
trading department, as well as an Asset and Liability 
Management Committee and a Risk Management 
Committee that are responsible for supervising market 
risks. The Market Risk Management Department or market 
risk limit controller within overseas branches are 
responsible for the identification, evaluation and control of 
market risk within the Bank, as well as executing routine 
management practices and ensuring the correctness and 
rationality of valuation principles, tools, methods and 
market information used in the assessment.The market risk reporting and assessment system performs 
a number of functions including position valuation, limit 
control, gain/loss monitoring, position management and 
calculation, stress testing and scenario analysis, pricing 
model, qualitative/quantitative risk reporting and VaR 
analysis. Furthermore, the Bank continually develops a 
Basel-compliant quantitative market risk management 
model to ensure compliance with New Basel Capital 
Accords, and thereby connect financial supervisory 
practices with the rest of the world.Proprietary trading positions undertaken by the Trading 
Department are monitored with net positions and exposures 
calculated on a daily basis. For derivative trading positions, 
risk exposure is calculated using product sensitivity 
indicators after taking into consideration the effectiveness 
of hedging positions.Standardized approach183Market risk capital requirementDecember 31, 2020; Unit: NT$ thousandType of RiskAccrued capital chargeInterest rate riskEquity riskForeign exchange riskCommodity riskOptions accounted using the simple methodTotal5,500,2412,368,305901,46012,31426,5588,808,8775.

to finance additional assets or repay liabilities when due, and therefore giving rise 
to possibility of losses.184Liquidity risk management system2020ItemDetails1. Liquidity risk managementstrategies and procedures2. Liquidity risk managementorganization and framework(1)  The Bank manages liquidity risk by placingstability at the top priority. For this reason, capital 
estimates are made conservatively and the Bank 
focuses on developing diversity and stability in its 
funding sources. Furthermore, uses of capital are 
balanced between safety and profitability, with 
steps taken to diversity liquidity risks.(2)  Business units are required to notify the Financeand Accounting Department and Market Risk 
Management Department of any material changes 
in liquidity position, whether actual or anticipated; 
Asset & Liability Management Committee 
meetings can be convened on an ad-hoc basis to 
discuss responses first and seek board of directors’ 
approval afterwards.(3)  The Bank has liquidity risk tolerance limits andalert indicators in place to manage liquidity risks. 
The Bank adopts a quantitative management 
approach and prepares monthly liquidity 
management reports for view by Asset & Liability 
Management Committee.(1)  The Asset & Liability Management Committee isresponsible for the strategic planning and 
supervision of liquidity risk management within 
the Bank. Routine funding and trading are executed 
by the Treasury Department. Factors that have an 
adverse effect on liquidity are to be analyzed and 
addressed with involvement from the Finance and 
Accounting Department and the Treasury 
Department in order to mitigate liquidity risk 
impacts upon occurrence of an unexpected event.(2)  The Bank has a set of “Liquidity Risk Management 
Guidelines” available to manage liquidity position 
and liquidity risks, and support business risk 
management by maintaining solvency.185ItemDetails3. Scope and features of theliquidity risk reporting and

strategies and procedures for 
monitoring the effectiveness 
of risk mitigation tools(1)  Scope of liquidity risk assessment may include:highly liquid assets, funding diversity and stability, 
balance sheet indicators, other liquidity factors and 
liquidity stress tests.(2)  The Bank manages liquidity risk by preparing“Liquidity Reserve Requirement Report,” “NTD 
Maturity Analysis Report,” “Liquidity Gap 
Analysis Report,” “Foreign Currency Liquidity 
Coverage Ratio Report,” and “Net Stable Funding 
Ratio Report” on a regular basis. These reports are 
used to monitor liquidity indicators and ensure that 
figures are within limit.(3)  In addition to monitoring liquidity risk throughmonthly reports, the Bank also conducts quarterly 
liquidity stress tests as means to assess its debt 
servicing capabilities. Outcomes are reported to the 
board of directors every six months.(1)  Deposit concentration is examined on a regularbasis. The Bank prepares “NTD Maturity Analysis 
Report” on a monthly basis, and a “Foreign 
Currency Liquidity Gap Analysis” is prepared for 
any foreign currency that accounts for more than 
5% of total liability. This report monitors negative 
gap in foreign currency assets and liabilities for 
each interval, and provides decision makers with 
an indication of how to diversify capital source and 
maturity.(2)  Overseas branches are required to discuss capitalplans with the Head Office based on asset/liability 
allocation and outcomes of liquidity and interest 
rate sensitivity analysis. Sourcing and use of 
capital shall comply with rules of the local 
authority and take into account factors such as 
safety and revenue potentials. Any mismatch in the 
maturity of assets and liabilities also have to be 
properly managed.(1)  The Bank has implemented “Business CrisisResponse Measures and Management Guidelines” 
to prevent solvency and liquidity crises that may 
arise in relation to occurrences such as abnormal 
deposit withdrawal, substantial loss of capital or 
liquidity shortage. The Guidelines not only ensure 
timely and effective crisis handling, but also 
mitigate impact from major or sudden occurrences 
to the protection of deposit holders, investors,186ItemDetails6. Explanation to execution ofstress testing7. Summary of emergencyliquidity response plantraders and market discipline.(2)  The Asset and Liability Management Committee 
convened meetings to devise responses whenever 
liquidity reserve falls below a certain level.The Bank performs stress tests on liquidity risk at least 
on a quarterly basis to assess the Bank’s debt-serving 
capacity should a liquidity crisis occur, and thereby 
measure and manage liquidity risks . Results of the 
stress test are reported to the board of directors every 
six months.(1)  Source adequate cash support. 
(2)  Balance sheet adjustment: recover funds or explorealternative sources of capital or funding channel.(3)  Issue official statements to clarify facts. 
(4)  Maintain order in the business lobby. 
(5)  Prevent peers from over-drawing deposits, andcontact foreign banking partners to secure existing 
credit facilities.(6)  Take necessary legal actions against offenders forcrises that arise as a result of fraud.(II)Impact  on  the  Bank’s  financial  standing  and  business  operations  due  to  changes  in 
domestic  or  foreign  policies  and  laws,  and  corresponding  countermeasures  to  such 
changes:Through compliance and internal control systems, the Bank continues to improve and 
optimize response to legal changes. Various measures have been put in place to ensure 
compliance with laws when performing financial service.The following is a summary of key compliance-related actions undertaken during the 
year:1.  Bank-wide compliance risk management assessmentThe Bank has adopted a compliance risk management and supervision framework, 
and  conducts  compliance  risk  assessments  regularly  for  all  business  activities 
throughout the Bank with enhancement actions taken accordingly.2.  AML and CTF plansThe  Bank  has  developed  AML  and  CTF  plans  along  with  standard  operating 
procedures based on applicable laws, risk assessment outcomes and business size. 
Both plans are being implemented to manage and reduce identified risks.3.  Continual enhancement of information securityThe Bank follows information security roadmap of the parent company  – Cathay 
Financial Holding as guiding principles and implements cybersecurity protections 
as  part  of  internal  control  in  line  with  industry  trends,  new  technologies,  cloud 
applications,  laws  and  self-governing  rules.  The  unit  is  also  responsible  for187maintaining  certification  with  global  cybersecurity  standards  (such  as  ISO  27001 
and PCIDSS). Furthermore, the Bank engages external professional consultants and 
white hat hackers to perform security assessments and tests on a yearly basis, so that 
improvements  can  be  made  as  necessary  to  enhance  and  keep  cybersecurity 
protections up to date.4.  Promotion of Financial Information Security Action PlanThe Bank has devised a 4-year program in support of FSC’s “Financial Information 
Security  Action  Plan”  introduced  on  August  6,  2020.  The  action  plan  aims  to 
strengthen  the  financial  industry’s  protection  against  security  threat,  thereby 
ensuring the security, convenience, and continuity of services rendered. Out of the 
nine objectives to be completed by financial institution, the Bank has accomplished 
five  of  them,  including  adoption  of  international  cybersecurity  standards  and 
obtaining  certification,  effectiveness  assessment  on  cybersecurity  governance, 
establishment  of  cybersecurity  monitoring  service  center,  encouragement  to 
cybersecurity  personnel  for  obtaining  international  certification,  and  assembly  of 
emergency  response  team  for  cybersecurity  incidents  in  coordination  with  the 
financial holding company.5.  Enforcement  of  supervisory  measures  for  domestic  systemically  important  banks(D-SIBs)(1)  The  Bank  has  also  amended  its  “Business  Crisis  Response  Measures  and 
Management Guidelines” to include response measures when capital adequacy 
ratio falls short of requirement. The amended guidelines will be reported to the 
authority along with Pillar II in 2021 to complement the Bank’s management 
efforts on capital adequacy.(2)  The Bank calculates capital adequacy ratio and leverage ratio under stressed 
scenarios  based  on  details  of  the  “Stress  Test  Plan  for  Local  Banks,”  the 
updated probabilities of default published by Joint Credit Information Center 
(JCIC),  and  the  stress  testing  scenarios  outlined  in  FSC’s  correspondence. 
Stress tests are conducted over a 2-year interval, and as a D-SIBs, the Bank 
would be required to propose response measures when submitting stress test 
results  if  it  fails  to  meet  the  minimum  capital  requirements  and  annual 
additional capital requirements under stressed scenarios.(III)  Impact on the Bank’s financial standing due to technological or industrial changes, andcorresponding countermeasures:1.  The  Bank  has  taken  progressive  steps  to  perfect  its  wholesale  banking  data 
infrastructure in recent years as part of its digitalization effort. An integrated visual 
platform  has  been  developed  to  assist  RMs  in  identifying  business  opportunities, 
overseeing risks, and improving internal operating efficiency. In the future, the Bank 
will  continue  adopting  new  analytical  techniques  to  broaden  applications  of 
available data.2.  Mobile  investment  platforms  introduced  by  online-only  banks  and  Fintech 
companies  present  strong  competition  to  the  Bank.  In  response,  the  Bank  will 
continue to perfect the end-to-end digital transaction process while at the same time 
upgrade its online banking webpage and App with investment-related features that 
not only empower customers, but promote good user experience as well. Meanwhile,188a wealth management service platform featuring data analysis technologies will be 
developed to gain accurate insight to customers’ preference and investment needs. 
The  platform  will  suggest  products  and  investment  strategies  for  individual 
customers,  monitor  risks  of  customers’  positions,  and  recommend  position 
adjustments in a timely manner to deliver a seamless, undisrupted online to offline 
(O2O) investment customization service.3.  Digital technologies, insurance digital application, and electronic security are being 
introduced to physical channels to fully digitalize the sales process. With the support 
of  automated  system  checks,  customers  are  given  access  to  a  diverse  range  of 
financial  services  as  well  as  faster  and  more  simplified  insurance  application 
processes.4.  In light of the government’s support for financial innovations (such as deregulation 
on  new  banking  services)  and  Fintech  development,  the  Bank  not  only  plays  an 
active  role  in  policy-making,  but  will  also  work  with  partners  from  within  and 
outside the group to develop innovative digital products and services. By providing 
customers an exceptional and unique experience, the digital channel has the potential 
to become users’ main channel for various services offered by the Bank.5.  Growth of digital banking and electronic payment reduces people’s dependency on 
cash.  Together,  they  create  a  cashless  environment  and  give  rise  to  new  payment 
channels  that  not  only  change  customers’  shopping  needs  and  behaviors,  but  also 
enable  gathering  of  transaction  information  for  the  creation  of  a  banking 
environment that conforms with people’s needs. This integration between payment 
service and mobile device allows merchants to develop new ways to interact with 
customers and presents banks with new profit models.6.  The  Bank  has  taken  progressive  steps  to  perfect  its  wholesale  banking  data 
infrastructure in recent years as part of its digitalization effort. An integrated visual 
platform  has  been  developed  to  assist  RMs  in  identifying  business  opportunities, 
overseeing risks, and improving internal operating efficiency. In the future, the Bank 
will  continue  adopting  new  analytical  techniques  to  broaden  applications  of 
available data.(IV)  Impact from a change of image and response measures:1.  Change of social responsibilities, image and other major events:(1)  Support for Cathay United Bank Foundation’s “Elevated Tree Program”①  The Elevated Tree Program has long been caring for underprivileged children. 
The program escalated its promotion efforts last year, using videos, social medial, 
and  news  coverage  to  convey  the  message  of  “changing  the  future  through 
education” and to rally public support.②  The program won Social Inclusion Awards in the 2020 TCSA (The 13th TaiwanCorporate Sustainability Awards).(2)  Support  for  “2020  Cathay  United  Xucun  Cup  International  SoccerCompetition”①  The Bank has been sponsoring Xucun Cup for 4 consecutive years since 2017with the hope of helping local teams secure a place in world’s top 100.②  The Bank supports sports development for children in remote areas in ways that189improve its public image. Videos, printed advertisements, social media posts and 
news coverage are used to direct the public’s attention to the issue.(3)  Sponsorship for National Geographic Channel’s Earth Day RunThe  Bank  has  been  supporting  the  environmental  protection  values  of  this 
program for three consecutive years. Global warming was selected as the main 
theme this time round, which the Bank became a named sponsor of to promote 
its  green,  sustainable  reputation 
in  TV  shows,  advertisements,  press 
conferences, and the actual run.2.

merger and acquisition.(3)  The Company will undertake rigorous reviews and carefully select its targets 
to  avoid  possible  risks  associated  with  mergers  and  acquisitions.  Detailed 
assessments  such  as  environmental  change,  capacity  limit,  competitiveness, 
competitors,  industry,  domestic/foreign  economy,  sensitivity  analysis  and 
M&A regulations will be performed during the planning stage. For any merger

and  evaluates  them  on  a  regular  basis  to  avoid  excessive  concentration  when 
carrying out banking services. For every  application submitted, both the business 
unit and the approver are required to examine utilization of the concentration limit 
and exercise concentration management of different aspects if appropriate. In terms 
of concentration monitoring, the Bank has adopted systematic practices to alert limit 
breach  on  a  daily  basis.  Limit  monitoring  reports  are  presented  to  the  Risk 
Management  Committee  on  a  regular  basis  to  facilitate  management  of 
concentration risks. For overly concentrated assets, the Bank may choose to suspend 
certain business activities or reduce concentration through sale or securitization of 
excess assets.(VIII) Effect  and  risk  caused  by  the  changes  of  the  right  to  manage  to  the  Bank,  and  thecountermeasures thereof:There had been no change of management in 2020.(IX)  Impacts,  risks  and  response  measures  following  a  major  transfer  of  shareholding  bydirectors, supervisors, or shareholders with more than 1% ownership interest:There had been no major transfer of ownership between shareholders in 2020.(X)  Major  litigations,  non-contentious  cases,  or  administrative  litigations  involving  the 
Bank  or  any  director,  supervisor,  President,  or  major  shareholder  with  more  than  1%

significant  impact  to  deposit  holders  or  shareholders  or  security  prices  of  the  Bank. 
Disclose the nature of dispute, the amount involved, the date the litigation first started, 
the key parties involved, and progress as of the publication date of this annual reportAs of December 31, 2020, the Bank had the following unresolved major litigation that 
arose in relation to normal business activities:Lee  &  Li, Attorneys-at-Law  (hereinafter,  “Lee  &  Li”)alleged  that  the  embezzlement194case  of Wei-Chieh  Liu  (a  former  employee  of  Lee  &  Li),  which  occurred  in  October 
2003, was caused by the negligence of the Bank, and Lee & Li claimed damages from 
the Bank in the amount of approximately NT$991,002,000. The case was brought to the 
court  since  July  2007,  and  Cathay  United  Bank  won  favorable  decisions  in  both  first 
instance  and  second  instances. At  present,  the  original  second-instance  judgment  was 
reversed by the Supreme Court. Now the case is remanded to the Taiwan High Court for 
further  review.  The  Bank  and  its  attorney  expect  no  material  adverse  impact  on  the 
Bank’s financial position due to the above litigation.(XI)  Other material risks and corresponding measures:None.VII.  Special Event Management(I)  The Bank complies with Cathay FHC’s “Incident Resolution Policy” and outlines the 
incident  reporting  and  response  procedures  to  be  followed  for  the  resolution  of 
exceptional occurrences, and thereby minimize impact of major incidents on the Bank. 
If  a  major  incident  occurs,  the  Bank  will  have  to  take  response  measures  in  a  timely 
manner, whereas the unit that is affected by the incident shall notify the line manager in 
the shortest time possible. If the incident raises any special concern that requires all units 
to be notified of its occurrence, the contact has to be made to prevent the incident from 
escalating.(II)  The Bank has implemented “Emergency Credit Risk Incident Reporting Guidelines” to 
minimize the impacts that a major or unexpected credit incident (whether it involves a 
borrower  or  an  investment  project)  may  have  on  the  Bank,  and  to  establish  proper 
reporting procedures.(III)  Emergency response to disastersThe Bank has implemented a disaster recovery and rescue system and adopted measures 
and  facilities  to  protect  itself  against  major  disasters.  These  systems  and  practices 
provide  the  Bank  with  the  versatility  to  respond  to  major  disasters  in  a  manner  that 
minimizes losses while maintaining capital flow, so that victims may receive relief and 
the society may quickly restore order and economic activities.The term “disaster” may refer to natural disaster (natural occurrences such as Typhoon, 
earthquake, flood, fire, landslide, tidal wave, blizzard and volcano eruption), manmade 
disaster (manmade occurrences such as protest, strike, riot, war and act of terrorism), 
and  other  forms  of  major  disaster  (spread  of  disease,  nuclear  incident,  explosion, 
communication/information  system  malfunction,  damage  of  operating  equipment  and 
incidents caused by other factors).The following actions are taken in response to disasters:1.  Disasters such as Typhoon, earthquake, flood, and fire are to be reported according 
to “Cathay United Bank Natural Disaster Reporting Guidelines”; all other disasters 
are to be announced and reported on a case-by-case basis.2.  Business hours during and after disaster are subject to the latest announcements ofthe authority, which are updated onto the Bank’s portal.1953.  The Bank has implemented the following emergency response measures to address 
situations where any of the abovementioned disasters causes damage or loss to Bank 
premise,  operating  equipment  or  key  files  (data),  renders  employees  unable  to 
perform duty, or renders business activities unsustainable to the extent that the Bank 
is compelled to rely on external support:(1)  Before incident:①  Assemble an Emergency Response Team②  Designate disaster contacts③  Organize disaster prevention training and drill④  Enhance facility safety maintenance and inspection⑤  Identify source and extent of impact(2)  During/after incident (once the situation has stabilized):①  Initiate emergency contact②  Convene Emergency Response Team meeting③  Confirm safety of employees and customers④  Draft an announcement to customers⑤  Assess damage and evaluate capital/resource requirements(IV)  Emergency response in the event of a strike:The Bank has a “Business Continuity Plan for Strike” and a strike response team in place 
to  coordinate  internal  departments  for  the  resolution  of  such  an  incident. The  team  is 
responsible for making decisions and conducting analysis on any sudden occurrence that 
may  affect  the  company,  and  undertaking  effective  measures.  Any  occurrence  of 
emergency event has to be notified immediately to the team secretary, who then informs 
the  convener  and,  depending  on  the  current  situation,  escalates  to  the  Chairman. The 
convener is required to host a team meeting as soon as possible after being notified, or 
instruct  departments  to  undertake  appropriate  responses  to  prevent  service  disruption 
while protecting customers’ interest and the Bank’s reputation.(V)  Emergency response for liquidity risk:The  Bank  may  undertake  the  following  methods  to  adjust  assets  and  liabilities  if  its 
liquidity is compromised by an emergency event:1.

by third parties).8.  Draw from central bank’s discount window: The Bank may place securities held in 
possession, including government bonds, treasury bills, central bank time deposit or 
NCD, as collateral to borrow from the central bank, or apply for secured short-term 
loan to cover liquidity shortage.9.  Other funding methods that comply with laws or are consistent with market customs.(VI)  Disease prevention:The Bank has “Communicable Disease Control and Reporting Guidelines” in place, and 
has developed “COVID-19 SOP” and “Levels of COVID-19 Response” specifically for 
COVID-19 to help identify the severity of epidemic so that proper disease controls can 
be adopted. The Bank adopts robust control and reporting practices for suspected and 
confirmed cases, and has preventive and recovery measures in place to respond to the 
disease.(VII) Major incidents:1.  Occurrence  of  robbery,  grand  larceny,  vandalism  of  office  premise  or  equipment,threat or natural disaster are handled as follows:(1)(2)If  the  incident  occurs  during  business  hours,  the  manager  or  staff  on-site

terms of the “Security Service Agreement” that the Bank has signed with the 
security service provider.(3)  Proper responses of personnel on site:①  When under threat of armed robbers, employees must refrain from any attempt 
of  resistance  and  should  remain  calm  and  take  note  of  suspects’  appearance, 
accent, age, hair, clothing, height, personal traits, tools and vehicles  including197color and license registration. Activate alarm where possible.②  Evacuate  personnel  on  site  through  emergency  broadcast  in  the  event  of  fire

outlined in the Notes.4.  Each  unit  is  required  to  develop  an  emergency  contact  system  to  ensure  timely 
reporting across employees of different grades. A list of at least 3 always-available 
contact  persons  including  the  unit  head  and  self-audit  officer  shall  also  be 
maintained on the “Audit Application System.” Any changes to the list of contact 
persons must be updated within 3 days from the effective date of change.VIII. Other Major EventsNone.198Eight.Special ItemsI.Information on Affiliates.See Attachment VI and VII.II.

CATHAY UNITED BANK CO., LTD. 
 
By: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
March 10, 2021219INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 
 
 
The Board of Directors and Stockholder 
Cathay United Bank Co., Ltd. 
 
Opinion 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Cathay United Bank Co., 
Ltd. (the “Bank”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”), which comprise the 
consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the consolidated statements of 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies 
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). 
 
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, its 
consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the years then ended in 
accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Public Banks, 
Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Firms, and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International Accounting Standards (IAS), IFRIC 
Interpretations (IFRIC), and SIC Interpretations (SIC) endorsed and issued into effect by the 
Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic of China. 
 
Basis for Opinion 
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the Regulations Governing Auditing and Attestation of 
Financial Statements by Certified Public Accountants and auditing standards generally accepted in 
the Republic of China. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with The Norm of Professional Ethics for 
Certified Public Accountant of the Republic of China, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
 
Key Audit Matters 
 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters.220Key audit matters for the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
December 31, 2020 are as follows: 
 
Impairment Assessment of Loans 
 
The domestic loans of the Bank which amounted to $1,510,492,015 thousand was considered 
material to the financial statements as a whole. As the assessment of impairment of loans involves 
accounting estimates and management’s significant judgment, and as the amount of impairment 
assessed on loans under the relevant regulations issued by the authorities is substantially larger than 
that assessed under IFRS 9, hence, we determined the impairment of the loans assessed under the 
relevant regulations prescribed by the authorities as a key audit matter. 
 
The Bank’s management regularly assesses its loans for impairment. Recognition of impairment 
loss on loans is based on compliance with regulations issued by the authorities regarding the 
classification of credit assets and provision of impairment loss. For the accounting policies and 
relevant information on the impairment assessment of loans, refer to Notes 4, 5 and 14. 
 
The main audit procedures we performed in response to the key audit matter described above are as 
follows: 
 
1.  We understood and tested the internal controls of impairment assessment of loans. 
 
2.  We tested the classification of the credit assets into their respective categories out of the totalfive categories to see if it complies with the relevant regulations issued by the authorities.3.  We performed the test on selected samples to ensure the appropriateness of impairment by thelength of the overdue period and the value of the collateral of each respective loan.4.  We calculated the provision of impairment loss by classifying the credit assets into theirrespective category to see if it complies with the relevant regulations issued by the authorities.Other Matter 
 
We have also audited the separate financial statements of the Bank as of and for the year ended 
December 31, 2020 on which we have issued an unmodified opinion. 
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the ConsolidatedFinancial StatementsManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by 
Public Banks, Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Firms, and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International Accounting Standards (IAS), 
IFRIC Interpretations (IFRIC), and SIC Interpretations (SIC) endorsed and issued into effect by the 
Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic of China, and for such internal control as 
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to 
liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
Those charged with governance, including the supervisors, are responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.221Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards 
generally accepted in the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. 
 
As part of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of 
China, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also: 
 
1.Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.2.  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design auditprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.3.  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accountingestimates and related disclosures made by management.4.  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accountingand, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to 
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.5.  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.6.  Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities 
or business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the group 
audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.222From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended December 31, 2020 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our 
auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication. 
 
The engagement partners on the audits resulting in this independent auditors’ report are Cheng-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 
(In Thousands of New Taiwan Dollars, Unless Stated Otherwise) 
 
 
  1.  INFORMATION ON THE BUSINESSCathay  United  Bank  Co.,  Ltd.  (“the  Bank”),  originally  named  United  World  Chinese  Commercial  Bank 
(“UWCCB”), was established in December 1974 after obtaining approval from the Ministry of Finance, Republic 
of China (“ROC”) and officially started operations on May 20, 1975. The Bank is mainly engaged in the following 
operations:  (1)  all  commercial  banking  operations  authorized  by  the  ROC  Banking  Act  (“Banking  Act”);  (2) 
international  banking  business  and  related  operations;  (3)  trust  business;  (4)  off-shore  banking  business;  and  (5) 
other financial operations related to the promotion of investments by overseas Chinese. The Bank’s registered office 
and main business location is at No. 7, Songren Rd., Xinyi District, Taipei City, Republic of China (ROC). 
 
The Bank’s stock was originally trading on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (the “TWSE”) until December 18, 2002, 
where it was delisted after becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cathay Financial Holding Co., Ltd. (“Cathay 
Financial Holdings”) on the same date through a share swap. Under the Financial Institutions Merger Act, the Bank 
merged  with  the  former  Cathay  Commercial  Bank,  a wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Cathay  Financial  Holdings  on 
October 27, 2003, with UWCCB as the surviving entity and was renamed Cathay United Bank Co., Ltd. 
 
The Bank merged with Lucky Bank on January 1, 2007. The Bank was the surviving entity after this merger and 
Lucky Bank was the extinguished entity. In addition, the Bank acquired specific assets, liabilities, and business of 
China United Trust & Investment Corporation (“CUTIC”) on December 29, 2007. 
 
Cathay Financial Holdings is the Bank’s parent company and ultimate parent company. 
 
The Bank’s consolidated financial statements are presented in the New Taiwan dollar.2.  APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Bank  and  its  subsidiaries  (“the  Company”)  were  approved  by  the 
Bank’s board of directors and authorized for issue on March 10, 2021.3.  APPLICATION OF NEW, AMENDED AND REVISED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONSInitial application of the amendments to the Regulations Governing the Preparation of 
Financial Reports by Public Banks and the International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS), International Accounting Standards (IAS), Interpretations of IFRS (IFRIC), and 
Interpretations of IAS (SIC) (collectively, the “IFRSs”) endorsed and issued into effect by 
the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)a.Except  for  the  following,  the  initial  application  of  the  amendments  to  the  Regulations  Governing  the 
Preparation of Financial Reports by Public Banks and the IFRSs endorsed and issued into effect by the FSC 
did not have a material impact on the Company’s accounting policies:1)  Amendments to IFRS 3 “Definition of a Business”The Company applies the amendments to IFRS 3 to transactions that occur on or after January 1, 
2020. The amendments clarify that to be considered a business, an acquired set of activities and232assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute 
to the ability to create outputs. To determine whether an acquired process is substantive, different criteria 
apply, depending on whether there are outputs at the acquisition date. In addition, the amendments introduce 
an  optional  concentration  test  that  permits  a  simplified  assessment  of  whether  or  not  an  acquired  set  of 
activities and assets is a business.2)  Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 “Interest Rate Benchmark Reform”Upon  retrospective  application  of  the  amendments,  the  Company  complied  with  the  hedge  accounting 
requirements under the assumption that the interest rate benchmark (such as the London Interbank Offered 
Rate or LIBOR) on which the hedged cash flows and cash flows from the hedging instrument are based will 
not be altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.3)  Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 “Definition of Material”The  Company  adopted  the  amendments  starting  from  January  1,  2020.  The  threshold  for  materiality 
influencing  users  has  been  changed  to  “could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence”  and,  therefore,  the 
disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial  report  have  been  adjusted  and  immaterial  information  that  may 
obscure material information has been deleted.b.IFRSs endorsed by the FSC for application starting from 2021New, Revised or Amended Standards and InterpretationsAmendments to IFRS 4 “Extension of the Temporary Exemptionfrom Applying IFRS 9”Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16“Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2”Effective DateAnnounced by IASBEffective immediately uponpromulgation by the IASBEffective for annual

    Benchmark Reform - Phase 2” 
 
 
“Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2” primarily amends IFRS 9, IFRS 7 and IFRS 16 to provide practical 
relief from the impact of the interest rate benchmark reform. 
 
Changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows as a result of 
    interest rate benchmark reform 
 
The changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities or lease 
liabilities are accounted for by updating the effective interest rate at the time the basis is changed, provided the 
changes are necessary as a direct consequence of the reform and the new basis is economically equivalent to the 
previous basis. 
 
As  of  the  date  the  consolidated  financial  statements  were  authorized  for  issue,  the  Company  is  continuously 
assessing  the  possible  impact  that  the  application  of  other  standards  and  interpretations  will  have  on  the

continuously assessing the possible impact that the application of other standards and interpretations 
will have on the Company’s financial position and financial performance and will disclose the 
relevant impact when the assessment is completed.2344.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESStatement of Compliance 
 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Regulations  Governing  the 
Preparation of Financial Reports by Public Banks, Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by 
Securities Firms and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International Accounting Standards 
(IAS), Interpretations of IFRS (IFRIC), and Interpretations of IAS (SIC) (collectively, the “IFRSs”) endorsed and 
issued into effect by the FSC. Disclosure information included in the consolidated financial statements is less than 
that required in a complete set of annual financial statements. 
 
Basis of Preparation 
 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  the  historical  cost  basis  except  for  financial 
instruments and investment property which are measured at fair value, and net defined benefit liabilities which are 
measured at the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets. 
 
The fair value measurements are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value measurement 
inputs  are  observable  and  the  significance  of  the  inputs  to  the  fair  value  measurement  in  its  entirety,  which  are 
described as follows:   
 
a.  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;b.  Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); and 
 
c.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
 
Basis of Consolidation 
 
Principles for preparing the consolidated financial statements 
 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Bank and the entities controlled 
by the Bank (Indovina Bank, CUBC Bank and CUBCN Bank). 
 
The accounting policies of the consolidated entities are same.   
 
All  intercompany  transactions,  balances,  income  and  expenses  are  eliminated  in  full  upon  consolidation.  Total 
comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Bank and to the non-controlling interests 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. 
 
Changes in the Company’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Company losing control over 
the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the interests of the Company and 
the  non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes  in their relative  interests in the subsidiaries. Any 
difference  between  the  amount  by  which  the  non-controlling  interests  are  adjusted  and  the  fair  value  of  the 
consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Bank. 
 
The Bank’s financial statements include the accounts of the head office, all branches, and OBU, in addition to the 
subsidiaries’ accounts. All intercompany transactions and accounts balances have been eliminated for consolidation 
purposes.235Entities included in the consolidated financial statements 
 
See Note 16 for detailed information on subsidiaries (including percentages of ownership and main businesses). 
 
Foreign Currencies 
 
In preparing the financial statements of each entity in the group, transactions in currencies other than the Company’s 
functional  currency  (foreign  currencies)  are  recognized  at  the  rates  of  exchange  prevailing  at  the  dates  of  the 
transactions. 
 
At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing at that date. Exchange differences on monetary items arising from settlement or translation are recognized 
in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for exchange differences on monetary items receivable from 
or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part 
of the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognized initially in other comprehensive income and 
reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal of the net investments.   
 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of 
non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the period  except for exchange  differences arising from the 
retranslation  of  non-monetary  items  in  respect  of  which  gains  and  losses  are  recognized  directly  in  other 
comprehensive  income,  in  which  cases,  the  exchange  differences  are  also  recognized  in  other  comprehensive 
income. 
 
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate 
at the date of the transaction. 
 
For  the  purposes  of  presenting  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  Company’s 
foreign  operations  (including  subsidiaries,  associates,  joint  ventures  and  branches  in  other  countries  that  use 
currencies which are different from the currency of the Company) are translated into the presentation currency, the 
New Taiwan dollar, as follows: Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the 
reporting period; and income and  expense items are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the time  of the 
transactions  or  the  average  exchange  rates  for  the  period.  The  resulting  currency  translation  differences  are 
recognized in other comprehensive income (attributed  to the owners of the Bank and non-controlling interests as 
appropriate). 
 
Current and Non-current Assets and Liabilities 
 
Since  the  operating  cycle  in  the  banking  industry  cannot  be  reasonably  identified,  accounts  included  in  the 
consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Company  were  not  classified  as  current  or  non-current.  Nevertheless, 
accounts were properly categorized in accordance with the nature of each account and sequenced by their liquidity. 
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
In the consolidated balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-
term,  highly  liquid  investments  that  are  readily  convertible  to  a  known  amount  of  cash  and  are  subject  to  an 
insignificant  risk  of  changes  in  value.  In  the  consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows,  cash  and  cash  equivalents 
comprise cash and cash equivalents, due from the Central Bank, call loans to other banks, and securities purchased 
under resell agreements as reported in the consolidated balance sheets that correspond to the definition of cash and 
cash equivalents under IAS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows,” as endorsed and issued into effect by the FSC.236Financial Instruments 
 
Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  recognized  when  the  Company  becomes  a  party  to  the  contractual 
provisions of the instruments. 
 
Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  initially  measured  at  fair  value.  Transaction  costs  that  are  directly 
attributable  to  the  acquisition  or  issue  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  (other  than  financial  assets  and 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial 
assets  or  financial  liabilities,  as  appropriate,  on  initial  recognition.  Transaction  costs  directly  attributable  to  the 
acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately 
in profit or loss. 
 
a.  Financial assetsAll regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date basis. 
 
1)  Measurement categoryFinancial assets are classified into the following  categories: financial assets at FVTPL, financial assets at 
amortised cost, and investments in debt instruments and equity instruments at FVTOCI. 
 
a)  Financial asset at FVTPLA  financial  asset  is  classified  as  at  FVTPL  when  the  financial  asset  is  mandatorily  classified  or 
designated  as at FVTPL. Financial  assets  mandatorily  classified  as at  FVTPL  include  investments  in 
equity instruments which are not designated as at FVTOCI and debt instruments that do not meet the 
amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria. 
 
Financial assets at FVTPL are subsequently measured at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on 
remeasurement recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates 
any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset. 
 
Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 49.b)  Financial assets at amortised costFinancial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortised cost: 
 
i.  The  financial  asset  is  held  within  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  to  hold  financial  assets  inorder to collect contractual cash flows; andii.  The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solelypayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets at amortised cost, including cash and cash equivalents, 
due from the Central Bank and call loans to banks, investments in debt instruments at amortised cost, 
receivables and discounts and  loans, are measured at amortised cost, which  equals the  gross carrying 
amount determined by the effective interest method less any impairment loss. Exchange differences are 
recognized in profit or loss.237Interest income  is calculated by applying the  effective interest rate to the  gross carrying amount of a 
financial asset, except for: 
 
i.  Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, for which interest income is calculated byapplying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset; andii.  Financial  assets  that  are  not  credit-impaired  on  purchase  or  origination  but  have  subsequently 
become credit-impaired, for which interest income  is calculated by applying the  effective interest 
rate to the amortised cost of such financial assets in subsequent reporting periods.A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more of the following events have occurred: 
 
i.  Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower; 
 
ii.  Breach of contract, such as a default; 
 
iii. It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or undergo a financial reorganization;oriv.  The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.c)  Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCIDebt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at FVTOCI: 
 
i.  The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both the collectingof contractual cash flows and the selling of the financial assets; andii.  The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solelypayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.Investments  in  debt  instruments  at  FVTOCI are  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value.  Changes  in  the 
carrying  amounts  of  these  debt  instruments  relating  to  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates, 
interest  income  calculated  using  the  effective  interest  method  and  impairment  losses  or  reversals  are 
recognized  in  profit  or  loss.  Other  changes  in  the  carrying  amount  of  these  debt  instruments  are 
recognized in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to profit or loss when the investment 
is disposed of.d)  Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCIOn initial recognition, the Company may make an irrevocable election to designate investments in equity 
instruments as at FVTOCI. Designation as at FVTOCI is not permitted if the equity investment is held 
for trading or if it is contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination. 
 
Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and 
losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
other  equity.  The  cumulative  gain  or  loss  will  not  be  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  on  disposal  of  the 
equity investments; instead, they will be transferred to retained earnings. 
 
Dividends  on  these  investments  in  equity  instruments  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  when  the 
Company’s right to receive the dividends is established, unless the dividends clearly represent a recovery 
of part of the cost of the investment.2382)  Impairment of financial assetsThe Company recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets at amortised cost, 
and investments in debt instruments measured at FVTOCI.   
 
The Company always recognizes lifetime expected credit losses (ECLs) for accounts receivable and lease 
receivables. For all other financial instruments, the Company recognizes lifetime ECLs when there has been 
a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  since  initial  recognition.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  credit  risk  on  the 
financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Company measures the loss 
allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs. 
 
For receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, the allowance for losses is recognized 
at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.   
 
Expected  credit  losses  reflect  the  weighted  average  of  credit  losses  with  the  respective  risks  of  a  default 
occurring as the weights. A 12-month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECLs that is expected to result 
from  default  events  on a financial instrument that are  possible  within 12  months after the reporting date. 
Lifetime ECLs represent the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the 
expected life of a financial instrument. 
 
The definition of the financial assets in default is described in Note 50. 
 
The  impairment  loss of all financial assets is recognized  in profit or loss by a reduction in their carrying 
amounts through a loss allowance account, except for investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI, for which 
the loss allowance is recognized in other comprehensive income and the carrying amounts of such financial 
assets are not reduced. 
 
According  to  the  Regulations  Governing  the  Procedures  for  Banking  Institutions  to  Evaluate  Assets  and 
Deal  with  Non-performing/Non-accrual  Loans,  the  Bank  assesses  the  customers’  financial  position,  the 
overdue payments of the principal and interest, and the value of collateral to classify credit assets into normal 
credit assets (excluding loans to the ROC government) and unsound assets which should be further classified 
as special mention, substandard, doubtful and losses, for which the minimum provisions are 1%, 2%, 10%, 
50%, and 100% of the outstanding balance, respectively. Furthermore, the FSC stipulates that banks should 
recognize  provision  of  at  least  1.5%  of  normal  credit  assets  in  mainland  China  (including  short-term 
advances  for  trade  finance)  and  loans  for  mortgage  and  construction  loans  that  have  been  classified  as 
normal assets, and further determine the allowance for losses based on the higher of the above-mentioned 
provision and the assessment of the expected credit losses. 
 
The Company writes off credits deemed uncollectable after the write-off is proposed and approved by the 
board  of  directors.  Recoveries  of  credits  written  off  are  recognized  as  a reversal  of  loss  provision  in  the 
current period.3)  Derecognition of financial assetsThe Company  derecognizes a financial asset only  when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the asset to another party. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of 
a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognize the financial asset and also recognizes a 
collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received.239On  derecognition  of  a  financial  asset  at  amortised  cost  in  its  entirety,  the  difference  between  the  asset’s 
carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. On 
derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument at FVTOCI, the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had 
been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition 
of an investment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized 
in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained earnings, without recycling through profit 
or loss.b.  Equity instrumentsDebt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in 
accordance  with  the  substance  of  the  contractual  agreements  and  the  definitions  of  a  financial  liability  or an 
equity instrument. 
 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
 
Repurchase of the Company’s own equity instruments is recognized and deducted directly in equity. No gain or 
loss  is recognized  in  profit  or  loss  on  the  purchase,  sale,  issue  or  cancellation  of  the  Company’s  own  equity 
instruments.c.  Financial liabilities1)  Subsequent measurementExcept for the cases stated below, all financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method: 
 
a)  Financial liabilities at FVTPLFinancial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial liabilities are either held for trading 
or designated as at FVTPL. 
 
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement 
recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any interest 
paid on the financial liability.   
 
A financial liability is classified as designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if: 
 
i.  Such  designation  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  a  measurement  or  recognition  inconsistencythat would otherwise arise; orii.  The financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which 
is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Company’s 
documented  risk  management  or  investment  strategy,  and  information  about  the  grouping  is 
provided internally on that basis; oriii.  The  contract  contains  one  or  more  embedded  derivatives  so  that  the  entire  hybrid  (combined)contract can be designated as at fair value through profit or loss.For  a  financial  liability  designated  as  at  FVTPL,  the  amount  of  changes  in  fair  value  attributable  to 
changes in the credit risk of the liability is presented in other comprehensive income, and it will not be 
subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. The gain or loss accumulated in other comprehensive income 
will be transferred to retained  earnings  when the financial liabilities are derecognized. The change in 
fair value of the outstanding liabilities are recognized in profit or loss. If this accounting treatment related 
to credit risk would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch, all changes in fair value of the liability240are presented in profit or loss. 
 
Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 49.b)  Financial guarantee contractsFinancial guarantee contracts issued by the Company, if not designated as at FVTPL, are subsequently 
measured at the higher of: 
 
i.  The amount of the loss allowance reflecting expected credit loss; and 
 
ii.  The  amount  initially  recognized  less,  where  appropriate,  the  cumulative  amount  of  incomerecognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policies.2)  Derecognition of financial liabilitiesThe  difference  between  the  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  liability  derecognized  and  the  consideration 
paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss.d.  DerivativesDerivatives  are  initially  recognized  at  fair  value  at  the  date  the  derivative  contracts  are  entered  into  and  are 
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in 
profit or loss immediately. When the fair value of a derivative financial instrument is positive, the derivative is 
recognized as a financial asset; when the fair value of a derivative financial instrument is negative, the derivative 
is recognized as a financial liability. 
 
Derivatives embedded in hybrid contracts that contain financial asset hosts within the scope of IFRS 9 are not 
separated;  instead,  the  classification  is  determined  in  accordance  with  the  entire  hybrid  contract.  Derivatives 
embedded in non-derivative host contracts that are not financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9 (e.g. financial 
liabilities)  are  treated  as  separate  derivatives  when  they  meet  the  definition  of  a  derivative,  their  risks  and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at 
FVTPL.Investments in Associates 
 
An associate  is an  entity  over which the  Bank  has significant  influence and  which  is neither a subsidiary nor an 
interest in a joint venture. 
 
The Bank uses the equity method to account for its investments in associates. Under the equity method, investments 
in an associate are initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Bank’s share of the profit or 
loss and other comprehensive income of the associate. The Bank also recognizes the changes in the Bank’s share of 
the equity of associates attributable to the Bank. 
 
Any  excess  of  the  cost  of  acquisition  over  the  Bank’s  share  of  the  net  fair  value  of  the  identifiable  assets  and 
liabilities of an associate at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying 
amount of the investment and is not amortised. Any excess of the Bank’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities over the cost of acquisition is recognized immediately in profit or loss.241When  the  Bank  subscribes  for  additional  new  shares  of  an  associate  at  a  percentage  different  from  its  existing 
ownership  percentage,  the  resulting  carrying  amount  of  the  investment  differs  from  the  amount  of  the  Bank’s 
proportionate interest in the associate. The Bank records such a difference as an adjustment to investments with the 
corresponding  amount  charged  or  credited  to  capital  surplus  -  changes  in  capital  surplus  from  investments  in 
associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method. If the Bank’s ownership interest is reduced due 
to  its  additional  subscription  of  the  new  shares  of  the  associate,  the  proportionate  amount  of  the  gains  or  losses 
previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate is reclassified to profit or loss on 
the same basis as would be required had the investee directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. When the 
adjustment should be debited to capital surplus, but the capital surplus recognized from investments measured by 
equity method is insufficient, the shortage is debited to retained earnings. 
 
When the Bank’s share of losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interest in that associate (which includes any 
carrying amount of the investment accounted for using the equity method and long-term interests that, in substance, 
form part of the Bank’s net investment in the associate), the Bank discontinues recognizing its share of further loss, 
if any. Additional losses and liabilities are recognized only to the extent that the Bank has incurred legal obligations, 
or constructive obligations, or made payments on behalf of that associate. 
 
The  entire  carrying  amount  of  an  investment  (including  goodwill)  is  tested  for  impairment  as  a  single  asset  by 
comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized is not allocated to any 
asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment 
loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases. 
 
The Bank discontinues the use of the equity method from the date on which its investment ceases to be an associate. 
Any retained investment is measured at fair value at that date, and the fair value is regarded as the investment’s fair 
value on initial recognition as a financial asset. The difference between the previous carrying amount of the associate 
attributable to the retained interest and its fair value is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal 
of  the  associate.  The  Bank  accounts  for  all  amounts  previously  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  in 
relation to that associate on the same basis as would be required had that associate directly disposed of the related 
assets or liabilities. If an investment in an associate becomes an investment in a joint venture or an investment in a 
joint venture becomes an investment in an associate, the Bank continues to apply the equity method and does not 
remeasure the retained interest. 
 
Profits  or  losses  resulting  from  downstream  transactions  are  eliminated  in  full  only  in  the  Bank’s  financial 
statements.  Profits  and  losses  resulting  from  upstream  transactions  and  transactions  between  associates  are 
recognized only in the Bank’s financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associates that are not related 
to the Bank. 
 
Nonperforming Loans 
 
Under  the  “Regulations  Governing  the  Procedures  for  Banking  Institutions  to  Evaluate  Assets  and  Deal  with 
Nonperforming/Nonaccrual Loans” issued by the authorities, loans and other credits (including the accrued interest) 
that remain unpaid on their maturity are transferred immediately to nonperforming loans if the transfer is approved 
by the board of directors.   
 
Nonperforming loans transferred from loans are recognized as discounts and loans, and those transferred from other 
credits are recognized as other financial assets.242Repurchase and Resale Transactions 
 
Securities purchased under resell agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements are generally treated 
as  collateralized  financing  transactions.  Interest  earned  on  reverse  repurchase  agreements  or  interest  incurred  on 
repurchase agreements is recognized as interest income or interest expense over the life of each agreement. 
 
Property and Equipment 
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. 
 
Freehold  land  is  not  depreciated.  Depreciation  of  property  and  equipment  is  recognized  using  the  straight-line 
method. Each significant part is depreciated separately. If the lease term of an item of property and equipment is 
shorter than its useful life, such asset is depreciated over its lease term. The estimated useful lives, residual values 
and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effects of any changes in the 
estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. 
 
On derecognition of an item of property and equipment, the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset is recognized in profit or loss. 
 
Investment Properties 
 
Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation. Investment properties also 
include land held for a currently undetermined future use. 
 
Investment  properties  are  measured  initially  at  cost,  including  transaction  costs,  and  are  subsequently  measured 
using the fair value model. Changes in the fair value of investment properties are included in profit or loss for the 
period in which they arise. 
 
On  derecognition  of  an  investment  property,  the  difference  between  the  net  disposal  proceeds  and  the  carrying 
amount of the asset is included in profit or loss. 
 
The Bank decides to transfer assets to or from investment property based on the actual use of assets. 
 
For  a transfer  from  the  property  and  equipment  classification  to  investment  property  based  on  the  actual  use  of 
assets, any difference between the fair value of the property at the transfer date and its previous carrying amount is 
recognized in other comprehensive income. 
 
Goodwill 
 
Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the 
business less accumulated impairment loss. 
 
For the purposes  of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to  each of the Company’s cash-generating units or 
groups  of  cash-generating  units  (referred  to  as  “cash-generating  units”)  that  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the 
synergies of the combination. 
 
A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or more frequently 
when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired, by comparing its carrying amount, including the attributed 
goodwill, with its recoverable amount. However, if the goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit was acquired 
in a business combination during the current annual period, that unit shall be tested for impairment before the end 
of the current annual period. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then 
pro rata to the other assets of the unit based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss 
is recognized directly in profit or loss. Any impairment loss recognized on goodwill is not reversed in subsequent 
periods.243If goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and the entity disposes of an operation within that unit, the 
goodwill  associated  with  the  operation  which  is  disposed  of  is  included  in  the  carrying  amount  of  the  operation 
when determining the gain or loss on disposal and is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation 
disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained. 
 
Foreclosed Collateral 
 
Collateral  assumed  (recorded  in  other  assets)  are  recognized  at  cost,  which  includes  the  assumed  prices  and any 
necessary repairs to make the collateral saleable, and evaluated at the lower of cost or net realizable value as of the 
balance sheet date. 
 
Intangible Assets (Excluding Goodwill) 
 
a. Intangible assets acquired separatelyIntangible  assets  with  finite  useful  lives  that  are  acquired  separately  are  initially  measured  at  cost  and 
subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization 
is recognized on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful lives, residual values, and amortization methods are 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in the estimates accounted for on a 
prospective basis.b. DerecognitionOn  derecognition  of  an  intangible  asset,  the  difference  between  the  net  disposal  proceeds  and  the  carrying 
amount of the asset is recognized in profit or loss.Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment, Right-of-use Asset and Intangible Assets (ExcludingGoodwill)At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment, 
right-of-use asset and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets  have  suffered  any  impairment  loss.  If  any  such  indication  exists,  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  asset  is 
estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. Corporate assets are allocated to cash-generating 
units on a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation. 
 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. If the recoverable amount of 
an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or 
cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount, with the resulting impairment loss recognized in profit or 
loss. 
 
When an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the corresponding asset, cash-generating 
unit or assets related to contract costs is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the 
extent  of  the  carrying  amount  that  would  have  been  determined  had  no  impairment  loss  been  recognized  on  the 
asset,  cash-generating  unit  or  assets  related  to  contract  costs  in  prior  years.  A  reversal  of  an  impairment  loss  is 
recognized in profit or loss. 
 
Leasing 
 
At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease.a.  The Company as lessorLeases  are  classified  as  finance  leases  whenever  the  terms  of  a  lease  transfer  substantially  all  the  risks  and 
rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
 
Lease payments (less any lease incentives payable) from operating leases are recognized as income on a straight-244line  basis  over  the  terms  of  the  relevant  leases.  Initial  direct  costs  incurred  in  obtaining  operating  leases  are 
added to the carrying amounts of the underlying assets and recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis over 
the lease terms. Lease modification that resulted from a negotiation with a lessee is accounted for as a new lease 
from the effective date of modification. 
 
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index  or a rate are recognized as income  in the periods in 
which they are incurred. 
 
When a lease includes both land and building elements, the Company assesses the classification of each element 
separately as a finance  or an operating lease based on the assessment as to whether substantially all the risks 
and rewards incidental to ownership of each element have been transferred to the Company. The lease payments 
are allocated between the land and the building elements in proportion to the relative fair values of the leasehold 
interests in the land element and building element of the lease at the inception of a contract. If the allocation of 
the lease payments can be made reliably, each element is accounted for separately in accordance with its lease 
classification. When the lease payments cannot be allocated reliably between the land and building elements, 
the entire lease is generally classified as a finance lease unless it is clear that both elements are operating leases; 
in which case, the entire lease is classified as an operating lease.b.  The Company as lesseeThe Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases at the commencement date of the 
lease, except for short-term leases and low-value asset leases accounted for applying a recognition exemption 
where lease payments are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. 
 
Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities 
adjusted for lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and 
an estimate of costs needed to restore the underlying assets, and less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use 
assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for 
any remeasurement of the lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are presented on a separate line in the consolidated 
balance sheets. 
 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to the earlier 
of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. 
 
Lease  liabilities  are  initially  measured  at  the  present  value  of  the  lease  payments,  which  comprise  fixed 
payments, in-substance fixed payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate, residual 
value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that 
option, and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the  lease term reflects such termination, less any 
lease incentives receivable. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in a lease, if that 
rate  can  be  readily  determined.  If  that  rate  cannot  be  readily  determined,  the  Company  uses  its  incremental 
borrowing rate. 
 
Subsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest 
expense  recognized  over  the  lease  terms.  When  there  is  a  change  in  a  lease  term,  a  change  in  the  amounts 
expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, a change in the assessment of an option to purchase an 
underlying  asset,  or a  change  in  future  lease  payments  resulting  from  a  change  in  an  index  or  a rate  used  to 
determine those payments, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the 
right-of-use-assets. However, if the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets is reduced to zero, any remaining 
amount of the remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in 
the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the periods in 
which they are incurred.245Provisions 
 
Provisions are recognized when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.   
 
Provisions  are  the  best  estimate  of  the  consideration  required  to  settle  a  present  obligation  at  the  consolidated 
balance sheet date, taking the risks and uncertainties on the obligation into account. Provisions are measured using 
the discounted cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation. 
 
Employee Benefitsa.  Short-term employee benefitsLiabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of 
the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related services.b.  Retirement benefitsPayments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognized as an expense when employees have 
rendered services entitling them to the contributions. 
 
Defined  benefit  costs  (including  service  cost,  net  interest  and  remeasurement)  under  the  defined  benefit 
retirement benefit plans are determined using the projected unit credit method. Service cost (including current 
service cost and past service cost) and net interest on the net defined benefit liabilities (assets) are recognized 
as employee benefits  expense  in the period  in  which they  occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains 
and  losses,  the  effect  of  the  changes  to  the  asset  ceiling  and  the  return  on  plan  assets  (excluding  interest),  is 
recognized  in other comprehensive income  in the period in  which they  occur. Remeasurement recognized  in 
other comprehensive  income  is reflected immediately  in other  equity and  will  not be reclassified to profit  or 
loss.   
 
Net  defined  benefit  liabilities  (assets)  represent  the  actual  deficit  (surplus)  in  the  Company’s  defined  benefit 
plan. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any refunds from the plans or 
reductions in future contributions to the plans.c.  Termination benefitsA liability for a termination benefit is recognized at the earlier of when the Bank can no longer withdraw the 
offer of the termination benefit and when the Bank recognizes any related restructuring costs.d.  Employee preferential interest rate depositsThe Bank offers preferential interest rate deposits for its current employees, which include preferential deposits 
and post-retirement preferential deposits for its current employees as well as preferential deposits for its retired 
employees, limited to a certain amount. The difference between the preferential interest rate and the market rate 
is considered as employee benefits. 
 
In  accordance  with  Article  30  of  the  Regulations  Governing  the  Preparation  of  Financial  Reports  by  Public 
Banks, the excess of the interests incurred in post-employment preferential interest deposits over those imputed 
at  the  market  rate  should  qualify  as  post-employment  benefits  under  IAS  19  “Employee  Benefits”  since  the 
beneficiaries are retired employees. The retirement benefits should be accrued by actuarial method.246Income Tax 
 
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.a.  Current taxAccording to the Income Tax Act, an additional tax on unappropriated earnings is provided for as income tax 
in the year the stockholders approve to retain earnings. 
 
Adjustments of prior years’ tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year’s tax provision. 
 
Since 2002, in accordance with Article 49 of the Financial Holding Company Act, the Bank’s financial holding 
company,  as  the  taxpayer,  and  the  Bank  elected  to  jointly  declare  and  report  income  tax  of  profit-seeking 
enterprise  and  tax  surcharge  on  surplus retained  earnings  of  profit-seeking  enterprise  in  accordance  with  the 
relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act. Additional tax payable or tax receivable due to the joint declaration 
of income tax is recognized under the payables or receivables for allocation  of integrated income tax  system 
account.b.  Deferred taxDeferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.   
 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are 
generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences and unused loss carryforwards to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be 
utilized.   
 
Deferred  tax  liabilities  are  recognized  for  taxable  temporary  differences  associated  with  investments  in 
subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Bank can control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests 
are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to 
utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and these differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable 
future. 
 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset 
to  be  recovered.  A  previously  unrecognized  deferred  tax  asset  is  also  reviewed  at  the  end  of  each  reporting 
period and recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred 
tax asset to be recovered.   
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which 
the  liabilities are settled or the assets are realized, based  on tax rates and tax laws that have been  enacted  or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets 
should reflect the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the 
end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.c.  Current and deferred taxesCurrent and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized 
in  other  comprehensive  income  or  directly  in  equity;  in  which  case,  the  current  and  deferred  taxes  are  also 
recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.247Recognition of Interest Revenue and Expense 
 
Except for the financial assets and  liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the interest revenue and interest 
expense arising from all interest-bearing financial instruments are calculated using the effective interest method in 
accordance  with the relevant regulations and standards and recognized  in the  consolidated statement of profit or 
loss under “interest revenue” and “interest expense” items. 
 
Recognition of Service Fee Revenue and Expense 
 
The service fee revenue and expense are generally recognized upon completion of the service to the customer for 
loan or other services; the service fee earned by the execution of the major project is recognized at the completion 
of the major project; the service fee revenue and expense related to subsequent lending services are either recognized 
over the service period or included in the calculation of the effective interest rate on loans and receivables. 
 
Customer Loyalty Program 
 
The points earned by customers under loyalty programs are treated as multiple-element revenue arrangements, in 
which consideration is allocated to the goods or services and the award credits based on their fair values through 
the eyes of the customer. The consideration is not recognized as earnings at the time of the original sales transaction 
but at the time when the points are redeemed and the obligation is fulfilled.5.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTYIn  the  application  of  the  Company’s  accounting  policies,  the  Company’s  management  is  required  to  make 
judgments,  estimates  and  assumptions  about  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  not  readily 
apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other 
factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of 
the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
 
Assessment of Impairment of Loans 
 
The assessment of impairment of loans is based on the value of the collateral, amount of principal and interest due, 
and the length of the overdue period. Changes in credit ratings on individual assets and the status of the collection 
are also considered during classification of the loans. The Company uses judgment  in  making these assumptions 
and in selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the Company’s historical experience, existing 
market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period. The inputs include risk 
of default and expected loss rates. For details of the key assumptions and inputs used, refer to Note 50.2486.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTSCash on hand

million; as of October 8, 2014, the issued subordinated financial debentures were US$660 million (perpetual) and 
US$330 million (fifteen years) with a fixed interest rate of 5.10% and 4.00%, respectively, and the interest is payable 
annually. The Bank is authorized by the authorities to redeem the US$660 million of bonds at book value after 12 
years and after fulfilling the specified conditions. 
 
In December 2014, the  Bank  was authorized to issue  unsubordinated financial  debentures amounting to US$180 
million (thirty-years), which were subsequently issued on March 30, 2015. In addition to the redemption of bonds 
by the exercise of call options, the bonds are redeemable on maturity; the bonds were issued in the form of zero-
coupon bonds, and the internal rate of return is 4.20%. The bonds have been fully redeemed on March 30, 2020. 
 
In March 2017, the Bank was authorized to issue unsubordinated financial debentures amounting to US$195 million 
(thirty-years), which  were subsequently  issued on  April 11, 2017. In addition to the redemption  of bonds by the

the fair value risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, such 
interest rate swaps were valued with a net gain of $1,921,169 thousand and $4,094,478 thousand, respectively.2519.  FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME20202019Investments in equity instrumentsDomestic listed shares

31,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  Those  related  to  investments  held  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2019  were 
$803,011 thousand and $609,463 thousand, respectively, and the remaining amounts were related to investments 
derecognized for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

The  Company  monitors  the  external  credit  rating  information  and  price  movements  of  their  investments  in  debt 
instruments in order to assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. 
 
The Company takes into consideration the multi-period default probability table for each credit rating supplied by 
external rating agencies, the current financial condition of debtors, industry forecasts, rating of securities issued by 
credit  rating  agencies  and  recovery  rates  of  different  types  of  bonds  to  assess  the  12-month  or  lifetime  expected 
credit losses.

Some of the Bank’s properties are held for earning rental income or for capitalappreciation, while some are for self-use. When the part held for self-use is less than5% of the individual real estate, the real estate is classified as investment properties.c.  The fair values of the Bank’s investment properties were based on the valuationscarried out by qualified real estate appraisers in Taiwan in accordance with the“Regulations on Real Estate Appraisal”. The valuation dates were December 31,2020 and 2019, respectively.Appraiser OfficeREPro KnightFrank Real Estate Appraiser Firm265December 312020Xiang-Yi, Hsu; 
You-Xiang Cai2019Hong-Xu, Wu; 
You-Xiang CaiThe fair value is supported by observable evidence in the market. The main appraisal approaches applied include 
the  income  approach  (such  as  discounted  cash  flow  model  and  direct  capitalization  approach),  comparison 
approach and cost approach. The significant unobservable inputs mainly include discount rates and the related 
adjustments, and categorized as level 3 of fair value hierarchy. 
 
1)  As office buildings have  market  liquidity and the rentals are similar to those  of comparable properties in 
neighboring  areas,  the  fair  values  have  been  mainly  determined  using  the  comparison  approach  and  the 
income approach. 
 
Net rental income is based on current market practices, assuming an annual rental increase between 0% to 
1.5% to extrapolate the total income of the underlying property, excluding losses as a result of idle and other 
reasons and related operation costs. 
 
According to the ROC Real Estate Appraisers Association Gazette No. 5, the house tax is determined based 
on the reference tables  of current house  values provided by  each city/county to  estimate the total current 
house value considering the area of the subject property and related public utilities. House tax is calculated 
based on the tax rates in the House Tax Act and the actual payment data. 
 
Land value tax is calculated based on the changes in the announced land values of the underlying property 
in the past years and the actual payment data. 
 
According  to  the  ROC  Real  Estate  Appraisers  Association  Gazette  No.  5,  replacement  allowance  for 
significant renovation cost is calculated based on 10% of construction costs and amortised over its estimated 
useful life of 20 years. 
 
The main inputs used are as follows:Direct capitalization rates 
Overall capital interest rate2020December 311.93%-3.79%    1.98%-5.76% 
  0.67%-1.93%    0.76%-2.89%20192)  The fair values of hillside conservation zones, farmlands and scenic areas had been determined mainly by 
the land development analysis and comparison approaches due to fewer market transactions in such areas 
as a result of legal restrictions and furthermore, no significant changes are expected in these areas that will 
affect the market in the near future.20202019$For the Year Ended December 31-

     $ 8,153,189(Concluded)The Bank acquired China United Trust & Investment Corporation on December 29, 2007 and recognized 
goodwill amounting to $6,673,083 thousand.   
 
The Bank acquired 70% of the shares of CUBC Bank on December 13, 2012 and recognized goodwill 
amounting to US$10,570 thousand, then further acquired the remaining 30% of shares on September 16, 
2013.   
 
During impairment testing of goodwill, the Bank treated individual business units as cash-generating units (CGUs). 
Goodwill resulting from the merger was allocated to the relevant CGUs. The recoverable amount was determined 
by the value in use of each CGU and was calculated at the present values of the cash flow forecast for the next five 
years based on the going-concern assumption. Future cash flows were estimated on the basis of present operations 
and will be adjusted depending on the business outlook and economic trends.December 312020$

contribution  plan.  Under  the  LPA,  the  Bank  makes  monthly  contributions  equal  to  6%  of  each  employee’s 
monthly salary to employees’ pension accounts in the Bureau of Labor Insurance. 
 
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized expenses of $413,783 thousand and 
$401,391  thousand  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  comprehensive  income  in  accordance  with  the  defined 
contribution plan, respectively.b.  Defined benefit planThe defined benefit plan adopted by domestic branches of the Bank under the Labor Standards Law is operated 
by the government of the ROC. Pension benefits are calculated on the basis of the length of service and average 
monthly salaries of the 6 months before retirement. The Bank contributes a fixed proportion of total monthly 
salaries  and  wages  to  a  pension  fund  administered  by  the  pension  fund  monitoring  committee.  Pension 
contributions are deposited in the Bank of Taiwan in the committee’s name.  Before the end of each year, the 
Bank assesses the balance in the pension fund. If the amount of the balance in the pension fund is inadequate to 
pay retirement  benefits  for  employees  who  conform  to  retirement  requirements  in  the  next  year,  the  Bank  is 
required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be  made before the end of March of the next 
year. The pension fund is managed by the Bureau of Labor Funds, Ministry of Labor (the “Bureau”); the Bank 
had no right to influence the investment policy and strategy.

1)  Investment  risk:  The  plan  assets  are  invested  in  domestic  and  foreign  equity  and  debt  securities,  bank 
deposits,  etc.  The  investment  is  conducted  at  the  discretion  of  the  Bureau  or  under  the  mandated 
management. However, in accordance  with relevant regulations, the return generated by plan assets shall 
not be below the interest rate for a 2-year time deposit with local banks.2)  Interest  risk:  A  decrease  in  interest  rate  will  increase  the  present  value  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation;however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plans’ debt investments.3)  Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated using the future salaries of plan 
participants. As such, an increase in the salaries of the plan participants will increase the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation.272December 31The  actuarial  valuations  of  the  present  value  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  were  carried  out  by  qualified 
actuaries. The significant assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 
 
 
 
 
Discount rate(s) 
Expected rate(s) of salary increase   
 
If  possible  reasonable  changes  in  each  of  the  significant  actuarial  assumptions  will  occur  and  all  other 
assumptions  will  remain  constant,  the  present  value  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  would  have  increased 
(decreased) as follows:

Under Order No. 10110000850 issued by the FSC, effective March 15, 2012, the actuarial assumptions for the 
employee benefits expense of the post-employment preferential interest rate deposit were as follows: 
 
 
 
 
Discount rate(s) 
Return on deposits   
Withdrawal rate of post-employment preferential rate 
deposits 
 
If  possible  reasonable  changes  in  each  of  the  significant  actuarial  assumptions  will  occur  and  all  other 
assumptions will remain constant, the present value of obligations on the post-employment preferential interest

    $ 38,687,276c.  Legal reserveRetained earnings are appropriated to legal reserve until the amount of legal reserve equals the Bank’s paid-in-
capital.  The  legal  reserve  may  be  used  to  offset  deficit.  If  the  Bank  has  no  deficit  and  the  legal  reserve  has 
exceeded 25% of its paid-in capital, the excess may be transferred to capital or distributed in cash. In addition, 
based on the Banking Act, if the legal reserve is less than the Bank’s paid-in capital, the amount that may be 
distributed in cash should not exceed 15% of the Bank’s paid-in-capital. In the event that the accumulated legal 
reserve  equals  or  exceeds  the  Bank’s  paid-in  capital  or  the  Bank  is  sound  in  both  its  finance  and  business 
operations  and  had  already  set  aside  a  legal  reserve  in  compliance  with  the  Banking  Act,  the  restrictions 
stipulated above shall not apply.d.  Special reserveAccording to Rule No. 1030006415 issued by the FSC, on the first-time adoption of the fair value  model for 
investment properties, the Bank should appropriate as special reserve an amount equivalent to the amount of 
the  net  increase  in  fair  value  transferred  to  retained  earnings.  In  the  subsequent  fair  value  measurement  of 
investment properties, the incremental fair value of investment properties is recognized in profit or loss and the 
same  amount  is  appropriated  from  retained  earnings  to  the  special  reserve.  For  any  subsequent  reversal  of 
accumulated  incremental  fair  value  of  investment  properties  upon  disposal  of  investment  properties,  the 
reversed amount can be distributed accordingly.276According to Rule No. 1010012865, Rule No. 1010047490 issued by the FSC and the directive titled “Questions 
and Answers for Special Reserves Appropriated Following Adoption of IFRSs,” the Bank should appropriate 
to  or  reverse  from  its  special  reserve  certain  specified  amounts.  Any  special  reserve  appropriated  may  be 
reversed to the extent that the net debit balance reverses, and thereafter distributed. 
 
The above special reserve may be used to offset a deficit; if the reserve has reached at least 50% of the paid-in 
capital, half of this special reserve may be capitalized.   
 
According to Rule No. 10510001510 issued by the FSC, the Bank should appropriate between 0.5% and 1% of 
net income after tax to the special reserve during the appropriation of earnings from 2016 through 2018. Since 
2017, the Company is allowed to reverse special reserve at the amount of the costs of employee transfer and 
arrangement in connection with the development of financial technology.

first utilized for paying taxes and offsetting deficits of prior years, if any. If the legal reserve is less than the 
paid-in capital, profit shall be appropriated to legal reserve and special reserve in accordance with the laws and 
regulations, and then any remaining profit together with any undistributed retained  earnings shall be used by 
the Bank’s board of directors as the basis for proposing a plan for the distribution of dividends and bonuses to 
shareholder, which should be resolved by the shareholder. 
 
In  consideration  of  the  competitive  environment,  business  growth,  and  capital  adequacy,  the  Bank  adopts  a 
residual dividend policy. According to the Bank’s business plan, except for a necessary amount of earnings to 
be reserved for dividend distribution, the remainder shall be distributed as cash dividends in principle. However, 
the maximum cash dividend may not exceed the regulatory limit.

185,19648.  IMPLEMENTATION OF CROSS-SELLING MARKETING STRATEGIES BETWEEN THE BANK,CATHAY FINANCIAL HOLDING CO., LTD., AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES 
 
The Bank has entered into cross-selling marketing contracts with Cathay Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Cathay Century 
Insurance Co., Ltd. and Cathay Securities Co., Ltd. The contracts cover joint use of operation sites and facilities as 
well as cross-selling marketing personnel. 
 
The Bank has entered into cooperation contracts with Cathay Financial Holding Co., Ltd., Cathay Life Insurance 
Co.,  Ltd.,  Cathay  Century  Insurance  Co.,  Ltd.,  and  Cathay  Securities  Co.,  Ltd.  for  the  joint  use  of  information 
equipment and the development, operation, maintenance and management of information systems. 
 
The related expenses are allocated to each subsidiary directly by the business nature or to the cooperating companies 
by other reasonable methods.49.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSa.  Information on fair value hierarchyFair value is the price that a market participant can receive from selling an asset or pay for settling a liability in 
an orderly transaction on a measurement date. 
 
Financial instruments are accounted for at fair value on original recognition, and in many cases, usually refers 
to the transaction price. On subsequent measurement, except for some financial instruments that are measured 
at amortised cost, they are measured at fair value. The best evidence of fair value is the open quotation in an 
active market. If there is no active market for the financial instruments, the Bank uses an evaluation model or 
refers to Bloomberg, Reuters or counterparty quotes to measure the fair value of financial instruments.b.  The definitions of each level of the fair value hierarchy are shown below:1)  Level 1Level 1 financial instruments are traded in an active market in which there are quoted prices for identical 
assets and liabilities. An active market has the following characteristics: 
 
a)  All financial instruments in the market are homogeneous. 
 
b)  There are willing buyers and sellers in the market all the time. 
 
c)  The public can access the price information easily. 
 
The products in this level, such as listed stock and beneficiary securities, usually have high liquidity or are 
traded in the exchanges.3012)  Level 2The products in this level have fair values that can be inferred either directly or indirectly through observable 
inputs other than quoted prices in an active market. The observable inputs are as follows: 
 
a)  Quoted prices of similar products in an active market. This means the fair value can be derived from the 
current trading prices of similar products, and whether they are similar products should be judged on the 
characteristics and trading rules. The fair price valuation in this circumstance  may be adjusted due to 
time differences, trading rule differences, transaction prices involving related parties, and the correlation 
of price between the product itself and similar goods;b)  Quoted prices for identical or similar financial instruments in inactive markets; 
 
c)  For the marking-to-model method, the inputs to the model should be observable (such as interest rates, 
yield curves and volatilities). The observable inputs mean that they can be obtained from the market and 
can reflect the expectation of market participants;d)  Inputs that are derived from observable market data through correlation or other means. 
 
The fair values of products categorized in this level are usually calculated using a valuation model generally 
accepted by the market; such products are forward contracts, cross-currency swap contracts, simple interest 
bearing bonds, convertible bonds and commercial paper.3)  Level 3The fair values of the products in this level are typically based on management assumptions or expectations 
other  than  the  direct  market  data.  For  example,  historical  volatility  used  in  valuing  options  is  an 
unobservable  input  because  it  cannot  represent  the  entire  market  participants’  expectation  on  future 
volatility. 
 
The  products  in  this  level  are  part  of  emerging  stocks,  unlisted  shares,  investment  properties,  complex 
derivative  financial  instruments  or  products  with  prices  that  are  provided  by  brokers,  such  as  complex 
foreign exchange options.302c.  Measured at fair value on a recurring basis1)  The fair value hierarchies of the Company’s financial instruments, which are measured at fair value on arecurring basis, were as follows:ItemMeasured at fair value on a recurring basis

transaction between willing market participants with full understanding of the sale or transfer transaction. 
The  fair  values  of  financial  instruments  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  financial  assets  at  fair  value 
through other comprehensive income and hedging derivative financial instruments with quoted prices in an 
active  market  are  based  on  their  market  prices;  financial  instruments  with  no  quoted  prices  in  an  active 
market are estimated by valuation methods. 
 
a)  Marking to marketThis method should be considered first when determining fair value. The following are the principles to 
follow when marking to market: 
 
i.  Ensure the consistency and integrity of market data. 
 
ii.  Market data should be obtained from publicly available, easily accessible and independent sources. 
 
iii.  Listed securities with tradable prices should be valued at closing prices. 
 
iv.  Evaluation  of  unlisted  securities  that  lack  tradable  closing  prices  should  use  quoted  prices  fromindependent brokers and comply with the rules issued by the authorities.b)  Marking to modelThe use of marking to model is suggested if marking to market is infeasible. This valuation method is 
based upon model inputs that are used to derive the value of the trading positions. The Bank uses the 
same estimations and assumptions as those used by market participants to determine the fair value. 
 
The Company uses the forward rates provided by Reuters to estimate the fair values of forward contracts, 
foreign exchange swap contracts, interest rate swap and cross-currency swap contacts and the discounted 
cash flow method to calculate the fair value of each contract. For foreign exchange option transactions, 
the Company uses the option pricing models which are generally used by other market participants (e.g., 
the Black-Scholes model) to calculate the fair value of the contract.3)  Fair value adjustmentsCredit risk valuation adjustments 
 
Credit risk valuation adjustments refer to the fair value of the Over The Counter (OTC) derivative financial 
commodity  contracts,  which  also  reflects  the  credit  risk  of  both  parties,  and  can  be  mainly  divided  into 
“credit value adjustments” and “debit value adjustments”: 
 
a)  Credit value adjustments (CVA): Adjustment to a transaction in a non-concentrated trading market, that 
is,  the  adjustment  of  a  derivatives  contract  evaluation  in  the  OTC  transaction,  which  reflects  the 
possibility that the Company may not be able to collect the full market value or the counterparty may 
default on the repayment of the fair value.304b)  Debit value adjustments (DVA): Adjustment to a transaction in a non-concentrated trading market, that 
is,  the  adjustment  of  a  derivatives  contract  evaluation  in  the  OTC  transaction,  which  reflects  the 
possibility that the Company may not be able to pay the full market value or the Company may default 
on the repayment of the fair value. 
 
Both  CVA  and  DVA  are  concepts  of  estimated  loss,  calculated  as  the  probability  of  default  (PD) 
multiplied by the loss given default (LGD) and multiplied by the exposure at default (EAD). 
 
The Bank uses the fair value of OTC derivatives to calculate the amount of exposure at default (EAD).  
 
The Bank uses 60% as the loss given default based on the recommendation of “IFRS 13 CVA and DVA 
Related  Disclosure  Guidelines”  of  the  stock  exchange.  The  Bank  may  use  other  loss  given  default 
assumptions based on the nature of risk and available figures. 
 
The  Company  incorporates  the  credit  risk  assessment  adjustment  into  the  fair  value  calculation  of 
financial instruments to reflect the counterparty’s credit risk and the Company’s credit quality.4)  Transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the periodThere were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for the  years ended December 31, 2020

measurements and ensuring that the results of the valuation are in line with market conditions, 
based on independent and reliable inputs which are consistent with other information, and 
represent exercisable prices. The department analyzes the movements in the values of assets and 
liabilities which are required to be re-measured or re-assessed as per the Company’s accounting 
policies at each reporting date.d.  Financial instruments that were not measured at fair value1)  Information on fair valueExcept as detailed in the following table, the management considers the carrying amounts of financial assets

instruments that are not measured at fair value are as follows: 
 
a)  Cash and cash equivalents, due from the Central Bank and call loans to other banks, securities purchased 
under resell agreements, receivables, other financial assets, due to the Central Bank and  other banks, 
call loans from the Central Bank and other banks, securities sold under repurchase agreements, payables, 
deposits and remittances whose maturity date is very near or the future payment price approximates the 
carrying amount take the amount in the book on the balance sheet date as the fair value.307b)  Discounts and loans, deposits, financial debentures and structured commodity principals are all interest-
bearing financial assets/liabilities whose carrying amount is taken as the current fair value. The carrying 
amount of nonperforming loan is the estimated recoverable amount after deduction of allowance for bad 
debts, hence its carrying amount is used as its fair value.c)  If an investment in a debt instrument at amortised cost has a public quoted price in an active market, the 
market price is used as its fair value; if no market price is available for reference, a valuation method is 
used to estimate the fair value. The estimates and assumptions used by the Bank in the valuation method 
are consistent with the information and assumptions used by market participants in the estimation of the 
fair value of financial products.50.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTThe  Bank’s  risk  control  and  hedging  strategy  follow  the  requirements  of  the  customer  service-oriented  banking 
industry and regulatory  environment. In  order to comply with the above requirements, the Bank adopts different 
risk management methods to identify its risks and the Bank follows the spirit and regulation of the “Basel Accord” 
to keep strengthening its assets and the practices of capital management to maintain the best capital adequacy ratio.   
 
The Bank has set up its risk management committee, whose responsibilities are as follows:a.  To amend the risk management policies, risk appetite or risk tolerance and report the above issues to the boardof directors for approval;b.  To manage and decide the strategy about the Bank’s credit risk, market risk and operational risk; 
 
c.  To report the significant risk management issues, such as credit ratings, market assessment and risk indicators; 
 
d.  To analyze the issues that the Bank’s business unit brought up for discussion; 
 
e.  Other issues.The Bank organized a risk management group to monitor, lead, develop, and establish the integral risk management 
framework.a.  Credit riskCredit risk represents the risk of loss that the Bank would incur if a counterparty fails to perform its contractual 
obligations. Sources of credit risk cover both on and off balance sheet accounts. 
 
The Bank, Indovina Bank and CUBCN Bank 
 
The  approval  unit  of  Cathay  United  Bank,  Indovina  Bank  and  CUBCN  Bank’s  credit  risk  strategies  and 
significant  risk  policies  is  the  board  of  directors.  Cathay  United  Bank’s  Risk  Management  Division  and  its 
subdivisions assist in reviewing and monitoring risk tolerance ability and risk control procedures; and establish 
credit approval processes, credit limit  management, credit rating information, collateral information, periodic 
reviews and remedial management systems. The subdivisions include the Market Risk Management Division, 
Credit  and  Operational  Management  Division,  Consumer  Finance  Credit  Management  Division,  Corporate 
Finance  Credit  Management  Division,  and  International  Credit  Management  Division.  Indovina  Bank 
established the credit risk management department to perform risk management. The credit risk departments for 
loans, investments, and financial instruments or contracts implement credit risk controls. Cathay United Bank 
and Indovina Bank perform periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its lending portfolios to identify credit 
risks and to assess the overall collectability of those portfolios.308The Bank, Indovina Bank and CUBCN Bank maintain a strict policy to evaluate customers’ credit ratings when 
providing  loan  commitments  and  commercial  letters  of  credit.  Certain  customers  are  required  to  provide 
appropriate collateral for the related loans, and the Bank, Indovina Bank and CUBCN Bank retain the legal right 
to foreclose or liquidate the collateral, which effectively reduces the credit risk of the Bank, Indovina Bank and 
CUBCN Bank. The disclosure of the maximum credit exposure shall not take into account any collateral held 
or other enhancements. 
 
CUBC Bank 
 
The approval unit of CUBC Bank’s credit risk policies is the board of directors, who sets the counterparty credit 
limits that are then implemented by the risk management department. These credit risk policies form the basic 
principles for all credit risk situations faced by CUBC Bank and also serve as the basis for the development of 
CUBC Bank’s various businesses in Cambodia. 
 
The loan committee is the top lending authority within CUBC Bank, and is composed of CUBC Bank’s senior 
management.  It  is  in  charge  of  approval  of  all  credit  in  excess  of  CUBC  Bank’s  lending  authorities.  Certain 
customers are required to provide appropriate collateral for the related loans, and CUBC Bank retains the legal 
right to foreclose or liquidate the collateral, which  effectively reduces Cathay United Bank’s credit risk. The 
disclosure of the maximum credit exposure shall not take into account any collateral held or other enhancements. 
 
Judgment of significant increase in credit risk after initial recognition 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank assess the movements in default risk during the expected lifetime of various types 
of credit assets at each reporting date to determine if the credit risk has increased significantly since the initial 
recognition. For the assessment, the Bank and CUBCN Bank consider reasonable and corroborative information 
(including prospective information) that indicates a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. 
The key indicators for consideration include: 
 
1)  Quantitative indicatorsa)  Changes in credit ratingWhen the credit rating at the reporting date has decreased to some extent compared with that on initial 
recognition  and  the  credit  rating  is  not  investment  grade,  credit  risk  is  deemed  to  have  increased 
significantly since initial recognition.b)  Information on the overdue status of a contractWhen the contract payment is overdue for 30 days to 89 days at the reporting date, credit risk is deemed 
to have increased significantly since initial recognition.2)  Qualitative indicatorsWhen the information observed at the reporting date meets the following conditions, credit risk is 
deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition. 
 
a)  Bounced checks are reported. 
 
b)  Auditors have expressed significant doubt on the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
c)  Auditors’ opinion - adverse opinion.309d)  Auditors’ opinion - disclaimer of opinion. 
 
e)  The stock was placed in full-cash delivery stock. 
 
f)  Other changes in the internal or external information on judging the credit quality changes. 
 
The Bank established Stage 1 and Stage 2 for debt instruments based on bonds ratings. Bonds rated above 
investment grades are classified as low credit risks. Credit risks are deemed significantly increase if credit 
ratings decreased over specific level after initial recognition date.Indovina Bank 
 
Indovina Bank assesses the movement in default risk during the expected lifetime of various types of financial 
assets at each reporting date to determine if credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition: 
 
1)  Notch downgradeA notch downgrade of obligor’s internal or external ratings between the current grade and the grade at initial 
recognition greater than a specific threshold would be classified as a significant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition.2)  Low credit risk criteriaAn  exposure rated below Moody’s investment  grade  (i.e., the credit rating is  lower than the credit rating 
Baa3  of  Moody’s,  an  international  credit  rating  agency)  at  the  reporting  date  would  be  classified  as  a 
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.3)  Past due informationThe contract payment over 30 days past due would be classified as a significant increase in credit 
risk since initial recognition.4)  Internal credit assessment indicatorsFor financial assets whose internal credit assessment indicators show a weaker credit quality 
compared to that upon initial recognition, credit risk is deemed to have increased significantly 
since initial recognition.CUBC Bank 
 
CUBC Bank assesses if the credit risk of financial assets at each reporting date has increased significantly since 
initial recognition based on the following indicators: 
 
1)  Past due informationAs of the reporting date, contractual payments more than 30 days past due for long-term loans or more than 
15  days  past  due  for  short-term  loans  would  indicate  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  since  initial 
recognition.2)  Loan classification from National Bank of CambodiaA  loan  contract  with  special  mention  position  at  the  reporting  date  would  be  classified  as  a  loan  with 
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.3103)  Internal credit assessment indicatorsFor financial assets whose internal credit assessment indicators show a weaker credit quality 
compared to that upon initial recognition, credit risk is deemed to have increased significantly 
since initial recognition.Default and credit impairment of financial asset 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank 
 
The  Bank’s  and  CUBCN  Bank’s  criteria  for  determining  that  a  financial  asset  is  in  default  is  the  same  for 
evaluating credit impairment  of financial assets. Where  one or  more  of the following conditions are met, the 
Bank determines the financial assets to be subject to default and credit impairment. 
 
1)  Quantitative indicatora)  Changes in credit ratingWhen  the  credit  rating  at  the  reporting  date  fell  into  the  default  level,  it  is  determined  as  credit 
impairment.b)  Information on the overdue status of a contractWhen the contract payment was overdue for more than 90 days at the reporting date, it is determined as 
credit  impairment.  Debt  instruments  that  do  not  pay  principal  and  interest  according  to  issuance  or 
transaction condition are determined to be credit impaired.2)  Qualitative indicatorWhen the information observed at the reporting date indicates the following conditions, it is 
determined as credit impairment. 
 
a)  Bailout, reorganization, individual agreement due to debtor’s financial difficulties; 
 
b)  Lawsuit action has been taken; 
 
c)  Debt settlement, debt negotiation; 
 
d)  Other internal or external information on judging the deterioration in credit quality. 
 
The aforementioned definition of default and credit impairment applies to all financial assets held 
by the Bank, and is consistent with the definition applied on the significant financial assets for the 
purpose of internal credit risk management, and is also applied in the relevant impairment 
assessment model.Indovina Bank 
 
Indovina Bank assesses the movement in default risk during the expected lifetime of various types of financial 
assets at each reporting date to determine if the credit risk signals default: 
 
1)  Notch downgradeAn obligation of one who has failed to pay one or more of its financial obligations or is rated as 
default at the reporting date is considered to be credit-impaired.3112)  Past due informationA loan with contract payment over 90 days past due would be classified as a credit-impaired loan.3)  Internal credit assessment indicatorsAssets that show credit deterioration according to the internal credit risk management indicators 
at the reporting date would be recognized as credit-impaired assets.CUBC Bank 
 
CUBC Bank assesses default risk during the expected lifetime of various types of financial assets based on the 
following indicators at each reporting date: 
 
1)  Past due informationLoan contract with payment more than 90 days past due for long-term loans or more than 30 days past due 
for short-term loans would be classified as a credit-impaired loan.2)  Loan classification from National Bank of CambodiaA loan contract with specific positions, such as substandard, doubtful and loss, at the reporting date would 
be classified as loan with a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.3)  Internal credit assessment indicatorsThe credit information used for internal credit risk management purpose that indicated credit 
deterioration at the reporting date would be recognized as indicator of credit-impaired assets.Measurement of expected credit loss 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank 
 
For the purpose of assessing the expected credit losses, the Bank and  CUBCN Bank classify the credit assets 
into the following  groups based  on credit category, credit rating, risk characteristics, enterprise size, product 
category and so on.Credit CategoryDefinitionEnterprise loanGrouped by risk characteristics, enterprise size and internal/external creditratingGrouped by product category and internal credit rating 
Grouped by product category and internal credit ratingConsumer loan 
Credit card 
 
When the credit risk of the financial instrument has not increased significantly after the initial recognition (Stage 
1), the Bank and CUBCN Bank will measure the allowance for losses at the 12-month expected credit losses. 
When the credit risk of the financial instrument has increased significantly (Stage 2) or credit impairment has 
existed (Stage 3) after the initial recognition, the Bank and CUBCN Bank will measure the allowance for losses 
at the lifetime expected credit losses. 
 
For the measurement of the expected credit losses (“ECL”), the Bank and CUBCN Bank calculate the 12-month 
ECL  and  lifetime  ECL  by  multiplying  three  factors,  i.e.,  probability  of  default  (“PD”),  loss  given  default 
(“LGD”) and exposure at default (“EAD”) of the borrower over the next 12 months and the life time.312The PD and LGD applied in the impairment assessment of the credit business of the Bank and CUBCN Bank 
are adjusted and calculated based on the internal and external information of each group of assets as well as the 
currently observable data and the forward-looking macroeconomic information (such as economic growth rate, 
etc.). 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank assess the EAD of loan at the reporting date. According to internal and external 
information, the Bank and CUBCN Bank consider the portion of the loan commitment that is expected to  be 
drawn within 12 months after the reporting date and for the lifetime, to determine the EAD for calculating the 
expected credit losses. 
 
The  Bank and CUBCN Bank perform  impairment assessment of  debt instruments  measured at FVTOCI and 
those measured at amortised cost in accordance with related requirements: 
 
1)  The EAD is measured at the amortised cost of a financial asset plus its interest receivable. 
 
2)  The  PD  is  based  on  the  information  regularly  published  by  Moody’s,  and  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the 
adjusted historical data according to the currently observable data and the forward-looking macroeconomic 
information (e.g., gross domestic product and economic growth rate, etc.).3)  The LGD is selected according to the type of debt instrument based on the information regularly publishedby Moody’s.The valuation techniques or significant assumptions for assessing the expected credit losses have no significant 
change for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Indovina  Bank  has  grouped  its  exposures  on  the  basis  of  shared  credit  risk  characteristic,  including  product 
category, counterparty type and enterprise size as follows:Category 
Loan portfolio 
Bond portfolio 
 
1)  Loan portfolioGrouped by counterparty type and enterprise size 
Grouped by product category, external credit rating and payment ranksDescriptionThe measurement of expected credit loss of Indovina Bank’s loan portfolio is based on its credit category, 
risk characteristics and product category, and is estimated by three main parameters, including probability 
of  default,  loss  given  default  and  exposure  at  default.  The  probabilities  of  default  and  loss  given  default 
were  built  by  the  Bank’s  historical  delinquent  information  and  recovery  data  and  calibrated  by  selected 
macroeconomic factors for forward-looking adjustment. The estimated amounts of exposure at default were 
calculated by the amortised cost and interest receivable. At each financial reporting date, if the above criteria 
for  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  since  initial  recognition  are  not  met,  the  loss  allowance  shall  be 
measured on the basis of the 12-month expected credit loss method. If financial assets meet the foregoing 
conditions  of  significant  increases  in  credit  risk  or  credit  deterioration  since  initial  recognition,  the  loss 
allowance shall be  estimated according to the respective  methods on the basis of lifetime  expected credit 
losses.3132)  Bond portfolioThe measurement of expected credit loss of Indovina Bank’s bond portfolio is based on its issuer’s category, 
issuer’s credit rating and risk characteristics. The probabilities of default and loss given default were built 
by  the  delinquent  information  and  calibrated  by  selected  macroeconomic  factors  for  forward-looking 
adjustment. At each financial reporting date, if the above criteria for a significant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition are not met, the loss allowance shall be measured on the basis of the 12-month expected 
credit loss method. If financial assets meet the foregoing conditions of significant increases in credit risk or 
credit deterioration since initial recognition, the loss allowance shall be estimated according to the respective 
methods on the basis of lifetime expected credit losses.CUBC Bank

The  measurement  of  expected  credit  loss  of  CUBC  Bank’s  loan  portfolio  is  based  on  its  credit  category, 
counterparty type and product category. The probabilities of  default and  loss given  default  were built by the 
internal  and  external  historical  delinquent  information,  LGD  supervised  under  Basel  II  and  calibrated  by 
selected macroeconomic factors for forward-looking adjustment. The estimated amounts of exposure at default 
were  calculated  by  the  amortised  cost  and  interest  receivable.  At  each  financial  reporting  date,  if  the  above 
criteria for a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are not met, the loss allowance shall be 
measured  on  the  basis  of  the  12-month  expected  credit  loss  method.  If  financial  assets  meet  the  foregoing 
conditions  of  significant  increases  in  credit  risk  or  credit  deterioration  since  initial  recognition,  the  loss 
allowance shall be estimated according to the respective methods on the basis of lifetime expected credit losses. 
 
Write-off policy 
 
If any of the  following conditions  exist, the Company writes  off  its non-performing and nonaccrual loans as 
uncollectible, less the estimated recoverable amount.   
 
The Company cannot reasonably expect to collect the financial assets with the following indications: 
 
1)  The recovery activity has stopped. 
 
2)  The borrower is assessed to have no sufficient assets or sources of income to pay the overdraft. 
 
The  Company  continues  to  pursue  recovery  of  written-off  amounts  according  to  policies  on  litigation 
proceedings. 
 
Consideration of forward-looking information 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank 
 
The Bank and CUBCN Bank use historical data to analyze and identify the significant economic 
factors that affect the credit risks and expected credit losses of each group of assets, and use the 
regression model to estimate the impairment parameter after the prospective adjustment. The 
significant economic factors and their impact on PD differ depending on the type of financial 
instruments.314The significant economic factors identified by the Bank and CUBCN Bank at December 31, 2020 are 
as follows:Credit CategoryEnterprise loanConsumer loanCredit CardProbability of Default (PD)Consumer Price Index

The category of credit asset and the grade of credit quality are described as follows: 
 
1)  Category of credit assetThe credit risk of the Bank is classified into five categories. Normal credit assets are classified as “Category 
One.” The remaining unsound credit assets are evaluated based on the status of the loan collateral and the 
length of time the asset is overdue. Assets that require special  mention are classified as “Category Two,” 
assets  that  are  substandard  are  classified  as  “Category  Three,”  assets  that  are  doubtful  are  classified  as 
“Category  Four,”  and  assets  for  which  there  is  loss  are  classified  as  “Category  Five”.  For  managing  the 
default credits, the Bank established the regulations governing the procedures to deal with non-performing 
loans, non-accrual loans and bad debts.2)  Grade of credit qualityThe  Bank  sets  the  grade  of  credit  quality  based  on  the  characteristics  and  scale  of  business  (such  as 
establishing the internal rating model of credit risk, setting the credit rating table or relevant rules to classify) 
to proceed with risk management.   
 
In order to measure the credit risk of the clients, the Bank develops the rating model of business credit by 
employing statistical methods and the professional judgment of the experts as well as considering the clients’ 
relevant information. The model is reviewed periodically to verify if the calculated results conform to the 
reality and make necessary revision to the parameters to optimize the results. 
 
With respect to consumer credit assets such as mortgages, credit cards, and small-amount credit loans, the 
Bank also evaluates default risk of clients by using the credit rating scores developed by the Bank and the 
external due diligence services. 
 
The credit quality of the Bank’s corporate borrowers is classified as excellent, good, average, or bad. 
 
To  ensure  the  reasonableness  of  the  estimated  values  of  the  credit  rating  system’s  design,  process,  and 
relevant risk factors, the Bank executes the relevant verification and tests the model according to the actual 
default every year so that the calculated results will be close to actual default. 
 
The Bank evaluates the counterparties’ credit quality before transactions are made and refers to the domestic 
and foreign credit rating agencies, when rendering different lines of credit based on the credit quality.3)  Hedge of credit risk and easing policya)  CollateralThe Bank adopts a series of policies to lower the credit risk, and one of the frequently-used methods is 
requesting borrowers to provide  collateral. To ensure the creditor’s rights, the Bank sets the scope of 
collateral  and  the  procedures  for appraising,  managing,  and  disposing  of  the  collateral.  In  addition,  a 
credit  contract  stipulates  the  bases  for  credit  claims,  preservation  of  collateral,  and  offset  provisions 
when a credit loss event occurs; the Bank may reduce the limit, cut down the payback period, or deem 
all debts as due. Also, the Bank may use the deposits that the borrowers saved in the Bank to offset the 
liabilities to lower the credit risk. 
 
Other  non-credit  business  collateral  depend  on  the  characteristics  of  the  financial  instruments.  Only 
asset-backed securities and other similar financial instruments are secured by an asset pool of financial 
instruments.316b)  Limit of credit risk and control of credit risk concentrationTo avoid the excessive risk concentration, the Bank limits the credit amounts of single counterparties 
and groups; the Bank also sets the investment guide and regulation of risk control of equity investment 
to restrict the investment limits of single person (company) or related company (group). Furthermore, 
the Bank establishes relevant regulations to control the concentration risk of assets, and sets the credit 
limits by industry, group, country, and stock types to monitor the credit concentration risk.c)  Net settlement agreementThe Bank usually settles by the gross balance, but signs contract with some counterparties to settle by 
net balance. If a default happens, the Bank will terminate all transactions with the counterparty and settle 
by net balance in order to lower the credit risk.4)  Maximum exposures to credit riskWithout taking into account the collateral or other credit enhancement instruments, the maximum credit risk 
exposures  of  on-balance-sheet  financial  assets  equals  their  carrying  amounts.  The  maximum  credit  risk 
exposures  of  off-balance-sheet  items  (without  considering  the  collateral  or  other  credit  enhancement 
instruments) are as follows:

To reduce the risk from any businesses, the Bank conducts an overall assessment and takes appropriate 
risk  reduction  measures  before  undertaking  the  business,  such  as  obtaining  collateral  and  guarantors. 
For obtaining of collateral, the Bank  has set Guidelines Governing Collateral to ensure that collateral 
meet the specific criteria and has the effect of reducing the business risk. 
 
The management deems the Company is able to control and minimize the credit risk exposures in off-
balance-sheet items as the Company uses stricter rating procedures when extending credits and conduct 
reviews regularly.

engaging in similar business activities and sharing similar economic characteristics, and 
vulnerable to the same economic impacts or other changes, the credit concentration risk is 
apparent. 
 
Credit concentration risk of the Company derives from the assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet 
items, and arises from performing obligations or engaging in transactions or cross-line portfolio 
of risk exposures including credit extension, due from and call loans to other banks, securities 
investment, receivables and derivatives. The Company does not significantly concentrate on a 
single client or counterparty, and the transaction amount with a single client or counterparty 
relative to the Company’s total bills discounts and loans, including overdue loans, guarantees, 
bills purchased, and acceptances receivable is not significant. Credit concentration risk of the

22,877,127b.  Liquidity risk1)  Source and definition of liquidity riskLiquidity risk means the Bank cannot provide sufficient funding for business growth and for 
meeting obligations on matured liabilities or that it has to make late payments to counterparties or 
raise emergency funding to cover funding gaps.2)  Liquidity risk management strategy and principlesThe purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure the availability of funds to meet present 
and future financial obligations. The Asset and Liability Management Committee is responsible 
for the planning of liquidity risk management strategy and the Financial Trading Department is 
responsible for the implementation, including liquidity risk measurement, interest rate sensitivity 
analysis, scenario simulation analysis and continuous contingency planning with quantitative 
management requirements and systems. The Bank adjusts its liquidity gap according to its daily 
funds and market changes to ensure appropriate liquidity. When the liquidity has or expects 
significant changes, the Bank immediately reports to the board of directors.3193)  Analysis  of  financial  assets  held  to  manage  liquidity  risk  and  non-derivative  financial  liabilities  byremaining contractual maturities 
 
a)  Financial assets held to manage liquidity riskThe Bank holds highly marketable and diverse financial assets to meet payment obligations and to be 
easily  liquidated  in  the  event  of  an  unforeseen  interruption  of  cash  flow.  The  financial  assets  held  to 
manage  liquidity risk  include cash and cash  equivalents, due from the Central Bank and call loans to 
other banks, financial assets at FVTPL, financial assets at FVTOCI, investments in debt instruments at 
amortised cost, discounts and loans, and securities purchased under resell agreements.b)  Maturity analysis of non-derivative financial liabilities of the BankThe table below shows the analysis of the cash outflow of non-derivative financial liabilities based on 
the  number  of  days  remaining  from  the  balance  sheet  date  until  the  contractual  maturity  date.  The

17,454,164Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse movements of market price, such as interest 
rates, foreign exchange rates and equity securities. 
 
The Bank organized market risk management department and the committee of assets and 
liabilities management. The department and the committee periodically examine the Bank’s 
structure of assets and liabilities; plan the pricing principle of deposit and loan and financing, and 
uses medium and long term funding schemes. While executing the market risk management, the 
market risk management department periodically provides the related information of management 
and reports to the authorized managers of the Bank for the management system, such as 
evaluating position, risk limit management, calculation of profit and loss, pricing model and risk 
analysis, in order to control the overall market risk.2)  Market risk management strategy and processMarket risk management process 
 
a)  Identification and measurementThe  operations  department  and  risk  management  department  of  the  Bank  identified  the  market  risk 
factors  of  risk  exposure  position,  and  measured  the  market  risk  further.  Market  risk  factors  are  the 
components that could have an impact on value of financial instrument, such as interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates, equity securities price, etc., including position, gain and loss, stress testing, sensitivity 
(DV01, Delta, Vega, Gamma) and Value at Risk (VaR) etc., are used to measure the extent of investment 
portfolio loss that is influenced by interest risk, foreign exchange risk and price of equity securities.322b)  Monitoring and reportingThe risk management department periodically reports the execution of market risk management target, 
position  and  gain/loss  control,  sensitivity  analysis,  stress  testing,  and  VaR  of  equity  securities  to  the 
board  of  directors,  and  helps  the  board  of  directors  to  fully  understand  the  status  of  market  risk 
management. The Bank also establishes a clear reporting process. Each transaction has the requirements 
about limitation and stop-loss points. If the transaction reaches its stop-loss limitation, stop-loss process 
will  be  implemented  immediately.  If  the  stop-loss  process  is  not  implemented,  the  transaction 
department  should  document  the  reason  for  not  implementing  stop-loss  process  and  response  plan. 
Furthermore, the department shall report to the executive management for approval and reports to the 
board of directors regularly.3)  Risk management policy of the trading bookThe trading book is the portfolio of financial instruments and physical investments for the 
purpose of trading or the hedge on the trading book. Portfolio is held for trading for the purpose 
of earning profit from the bid-ask spread. Any positions aside from the above trading book will 
be in the banking book. 
 
a)  StrategyIn order to control market risk effectively and ensure flexibility in operating the transaction strategy, the 
Bank carries out various assessment and control. The portfolio of trading book has the risk limit for each 
investment portfolio which is set according to the transaction strategy, category of investment and the 
annual profit target.b)  Policy and procedureThe  Bank  sets  the  “Rules  of  Market  Risk  Management”  as  the  important  regulation  that  should  be 
complied with when holding trading portfolio.c)  Valuation policyIf the financial instruments of trading book have market values, they should be evaluated at least once 
each  day  based  on  information  from  independent  and  easily  accessible  sources.  If  the  financial 
instruments  are  evaluated  by  a  model,  a  mathematical  model  should  be  used  prudently,  and  the 
assumptions and parameters of the valuation model should be regularly reviewed and examined.d)  Method of measurementi.  The assumptions and calculation method are described in the VaR section. 
 
ii.  The Bank executes the stress testing monthly based on the following scenarios: The fluctuation of 
interest rate at 100bp, equity securities price at 15% and foreign exchange rate at 3%, and reports to 
the risk management committee regularly.4)  Interest risk management of trading booka)  Definition of interest riskInterest risk is the risk that the trading portfolios suffer losses or the fair value changes due to fluctuations 
in interest rates. The main instruments include the securities and derivatives that are related to interest 
rates.323b)  Interest risk management procedure of trading bookThe Bank prudently choose its investment target by studying the credibility and financial position of the 
securities issuers, and the sovereign risk and the trend of interest rates of the country. According to the 
operating strategy and the circumstances of the market, the Bank sets the transaction limit and stop-loss 
limit (including the limits  of  dealing room, traders, and  investment,  etc.) of the trading book that are 
reported to the executive management or the board of directors for approval.c)  Method of measurementi.  The assumptions and calculation method are described in the VaR section. 
ii.  The Bank measures the investment portfolio’s interest risk exposure with DV01 monthly.5)  Interest risk management of banking bookThe  main  objective  of  interest  risk  management  of  the  banking  book  is  to  enhance  the  interest  risk 
management, increase the operating efficiency of the fund and strengthen the business operation.   
 
a)  StrategyInterest risk management enhances the Bank’s ability to take responsive actions to measure, to manage 
and avoid the risk that the fluctuation of interest rate may cause on the profit and the economic value of 
assets or liabilities.b)  Management procedureWhen undertaking the operations relating to interest rate instruments, the Bank identifies the repricing 
risk  of interest rate, yield curve risk, basis risk and  options risk characteristics. In addition, the  Bank 
also measures the potential impact of interest rate changes on the profit and economic value of the Bank. 
The  Bank  analyzes  and  monitors  the  interest  risk  limits  and  each  target  of  interest  risk  management 
monthly. The results of analysis and monitoring are regularly reported to not only the risk management 
committee but also the board of directors. 
 
If any risk management targets are found to exceed the limit during the monitoring process, it will be 
reported to the risk management committee and a solution should be proposed.c)  Method of measurementThe interest risk of the Bank is mainly measured by the repricing risk that is caused by the difference 
between maturity date and repricing date of the assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items in banking 
book.  To  stabilize  long-term  profitability  and  ensure  business  growth,  the  Bank  sets  the  monitoring 
indicators of interest sensitivity in major terms and implements stress testing. Each interest risk indicator 
and the result of stress testing are reported to the executive management regularly for review.6)  Foreign exchange risk managementa)  Definition of foreign exchange riskForeign exchange risk is the gain/loss caused by two currencies exchange at different times. The Bank’s 
foreign exchange risk arises from the derivative instruments, such as spot exchange, forward exchange 
and foreign exchange option, etc. The Bank’s foreign exchange transactions are implemented daily to 
offset clients’ positions. Thus, the Bank is not exposed to significant foreign exchange risk.324b)  Policy, procedure and measurement method of foreign exchange risk managementIn order to control foreign exchange risk, the Bank sets the limits of transaction and stop-loss limits for 
the dealing room and traders. Meanwhile, the Bank also sets the maximum annual loss limit to control 
the loss within the tolerable extent. Foreign exchange risk is controlled based on VaR. The assumption 
and calculation of VaR are described in the VaR section. 
 
For  foreign  exchange  risk,  the  Bank  sets  the  scenario  at  3%  fluctuation  of  foreign  exchange  rates  of 
major currencies to execute the stress testing quarterly, and reports to the risk management committee.c)  The significant portfolio of foreign currency financial assets and liabilities are as follows:Financial assets

6,913,340As the Company has a large variety of foreign currencies, it is not possible to disclose foreign currency 
exchange gain or loss based on each foreign currency’s exposure to major impact. The foreign currency 
exchange gains were $1,237,639 thousand and $1,165,079 thousand for the years ended December 31, 
2020 and 2019, respectively.7)  Risk management of equity securities pricea)  Definition of risk of equity securities priceThe market risk of equity securities held by the Bank includes the individual risk from the fluctuation 
of individual equity securities’ market price and general market risk from the fluctuation of the overall 
price trend.b)  Purpose of risk management of equity securities priceThe  purpose  is  to  avoid  the  massive  fluctuation  of  equity  securities  price  that  worsens  the  Bank’s 
financial situation or earnings; to raise the  operating efficiency of capital and strengthen the business 
operation.c)  Procedure of risk management of equity securities priceThe  Bank  sets  investment  limits  on  industries,  using  the  β  value  to  measure  the  investment  portfolio 
affected by the systemic risk monthly. The stop-loss point must be authorized by the board of directors, 
and the  equity investment should be authorized by the executives if the stop-loss point is reached but 
the investment is not going to be disposed of.326d)  Measurement methodThe risk of equity securities price in trading book is mainly controlled by VaR.The Bank’s risk of equity securities prices from its non-trading portfolio should be controlled by the Bank 
according to its own business scale to develop a stress testing under appropriate scenarios and report to the 
risk management committee. 
 
The Bank adopts many methods to manage its market risk. Value-at-risk (VaR) is one of the methods. VaR 
is a statistical measure that assesses potential losses that might be caused by changes in risk factors over a 
specified  period  of  time  and  at  a  specific  level  of  statistical  confidence.  The  Bank  applies  historical 
simulation  with  a  statistical  confidence  of  99%  to  extrapolate  the  VaR  of  one-year  fluctuations.  The 
following form indicates the VaR which is the estimation of potential amount of loss within one day. The 
statistical confidence of 99% represents the possible fluctuations that would be included in assumed adverse 
market changes. Based on the assumption, the VaR may exceed the amounts listed in 1 of 100 days due to 
the  price  changes  in  the  market.  The  overall  VaR  in  the  market  may  be  less  than  the  aggregate  VaR  of 
individual market risk factors.Factors of Market Risk

During Cathay United Bank and its subsidiaries’ daily operations, transferred financial assets that do not meet 
the  criteria  for  full  derecognition  are  mostly  made  up  of  debt  securities  used  as  counterparty  collateral  for 
repurchase  agreements  or  equity  securities  lent  as  part  of  securities  lending  agreement.  The  nature  of  these 
transactions  are  secured  loans,  and  reflects  the  liability  where  the  Company  is  obligated  to  repurchase  the 
transferred financial assets according to a fixed price in future periods. With respect to such transactions, the 
Company  will  not  be  able  to  use,  sell  or  pledge  such  transferred  financial  assets  during  the  effective  period. 
However, the Company is still exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk, hence they are not derecognized.

agreements with counterparties, for example: Global master repurchase agreements, global securities 
lending agreements, or other similar agreements. Financial instruments subject to enforceable master 
netting arrangement or other similar agreements could be settled at net amount as chosen by the

Note 1:  Eligible capital and risk-weighted assets are calculated under the “Regulations Governingthe Capital Adequacy Ratio of Banks” and “Explanation of Methods for Calculating the 
Eligible Capital and Risk-Weighted Assets of Banks.”Note 2:  Formulas used were as follows:1)  Eligible capital = Common equity + Other Tier 1 capital + Tier 2 capital.3322)  Risk-weighted assets = Risk-weighted asset for credit risk + Capital requirements foroperational risk and market risk x 12.5.3)  Capital adequacy ratio = Eligible capital ÷ Risk-weighted assets. 
 
4)  Ratio of the common equity to risk-weighted assets = Common equity ÷ Risk-weightedassets.5)  Ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets = (Common equity + Other Tier 1 capital)÷ Risk-weighted assets.6)  Leverage ratio = Tier 1 capital ÷ Exposure measurement.The  Banking  Law  and  related  regulations  require  the  Bank  to  maintain  its  unconsolidated  and  consolidated 
CARs at a minimum of 10.5%, the Tier 1 Capital Ratio at a minimum of 8.5% and the Common Equity Tier 1 
Ratio at a minimum of 7%. In addition, if the Bank’s CAR falls below the minimum requirement, the authorities

The Board of Directors and Stockholder   
Cathay United Bank Co., Ltd.   
 
Opinion   
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Cathay United Bank Co., Ltd. (the “Bank”), which 
comprise the balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the statements of comprehensive income, 
changes in equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the notes to the financial statements, including 
a summary of significant accounting policies (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).   
 
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the Bank as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, its financial performance, and its cash flows for the 
years then ended, in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by 
Public Banks and Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Firms.   
 
Basis for Opinion   
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the Regulations Governing Auditing and Attestation of Financial 
Statements by Certified Public Accountants and auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of 
China. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with 
The Norm of Professional Ethics for Certified Public Accountant of the Republic of China, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.   
 
Key Audit Matters   
 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit 
of the financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2020. These matters were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.348The key audit matters of the Bank’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 are stated as 
follows:   
 
Impairment Assessment of Loans   
 
The domestic loans of the Bank which amounted to $1,510,492,015 thousand was considered material to the 
financial statements as a whole. As the assessment of impairment of loans involves accounting estimates and 
management’s significant judgment, and as the amount of impairment assessed on loans under the relevant 
regulations issued by the authorities is substantially larger than that assessed under IFRS 9, hence, we 
determined the impairment of the loans assessed under the relevant regulations prescribed by the authorities as 
a key audit matter.   
 
The Bank’s management regularly assesses its loans for impairment. Recognition of impairment loss on loans 
is based on compliance with regulations issued by the authorities regarding the classification of credit assets 
and provision of impairment loss. For the accounting policies and relevant information on the impairment 
assessment of loans, refer to Notes 4, 5 and 14.   
 
The main audit procedures we performed in response to the key audit matter described above are as follows:   
 
1. We understood and tested the internal controls of impairment assessment of loans.   
 
2. We tested the classification of the credit assets into their respective categories out of the total five categoriesto see if it complies with the relevant regulations issued by the authorities.3. We performed the test on selected samples to ensure the appropriateness of impairment by the length of theoverdue period and the value of the collateral of each respective loan.4. We calculated the provision of impairment loss by classifying the credit assets into their respective categoryto see if it complies with the relevant regulations issued by the authorities.Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements   
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance 
with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Public Banks and Regulations 
Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Firms, and for such internal control as 
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.   
 
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.   
 
Those charged with governance, including the supervisors, are responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial 
reporting process.- 349 -Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements   
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements.   
 
As part of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China, we 
exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:   
 
1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud orerror, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that areappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the Bank’s internal control.3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimatesand related disclosures made by management.4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, basedon the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related 
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including thedisclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.6. Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or businessactivities within the Bank to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the 
direction, supervision, and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that 
we identify during our audit.- 350 -From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
