NEW OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR THE FUTUREKorea Development Bank has been the backbone of the Korean economy and financial 
industry since its founding in 1954. Through the decades, we have continued to 
evolve in line with the demands of our markets and stakeholders, and we are now 
transforming from Korea’s leading policy finance institution into a financial platform of 
Korea leading to a bright future.As we usher in the new era of the 4th Industrial Revolution, KDB is providing a strong 
impetus, turning transactions into connections, connections into opportunities, 
and opportunities into powerful engines of new growth, thus fulfilling our role as an 
advanced policy bank at the forefront of Korea’s sustainable growth.004MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN & CEO005Message from the Chairman & CEODear Clients and Readers,
I would like to express my sincere appreciation to all our clients, partner 
organizations, and stakeholders for your unwavering support and trust.
In 2019, KDB, as an advanced policy bank, once again propelled Korea’s 
sustainable growth. In particular, we have sought to enhance the nation’s 
growth potential, promote balanced development, and improve people’s 
quality of life.
KDB has made great strides in restructuring deals amid economic 
challenges and trailblazed the path toward innovative growth in 
order to enhance its competitiveness. With the aim of supporting the 
government’s policy-making in the sectors of innovative growth, we 
conducted in-depth research on industries including material, parts, 
equipment and logistics and provided funds worth KRW 16 trillion to 
the related sectors in the year 2019. Furthermore, KDB NextRound, the 
unique venture investment platform set up by KDB in 2016 for initiating 
start-ups, is now thriving and has received positive feedback on its 
potential to be equally well-received in the global arena.
Our goal in 2020 is to raise KDB’s competitiveness to new heights 
through innovations that may require a radical departure from 
conventional practices. To this end, we plan to focus on the following 
objectives to create a better future and overcome any challenges that 
may arise in the course of our journey.First, KDB will strive to foster the next leading companies and 
new industries.
To solidify the foundation for future economic growth, KDB will discover 
and incubate new leaders who will bring about growth and innovation. 
We also commit to reinforcing our business operations to provide 
customized solutions for SMEs and MEs with greater support in terms of 
scope and size so that we may build a favorable environment for the birth 
of new unicorn companies. We plan to set up a special program that 
will ensure investments in early stage industries and innovative firms, 
and to offer new financial solutions that are designed to accommodate 
companies’ intellectual properties and data assets. Meanwhile, we will 
continue to lay the groundwork for nurturing newly emerging industries 
by conducting extensive research on promising industries.
To fulfill the plan more effectively, KDB undertook a slight reorganization. 
We established the Venture Finance Center at our head office in order 
to concentrate the resources and competence we want to direct to 
start-ups, and also introduced the Scale-up Banking Department 
within the Venture Finance Center for the purpose of helping promising 
start-ups unlock their full potential and blossom into scaleups. The 
Department will focus on providing large-scale financing to start-ups and 
comprehensive financial support to existing venture enterprises.Second, KDB will make active investments in its digitalization 
and innovation.
KDB is committed to carrying out bank-wide digital transformation and 
applying digital technologies to every part of our working processes. In 
fact, we opened KDB Digital Square, the second headquarters building 
located in Hanam city to serve as an IT center, in 2019. Within the 
new center, the newly established Digital Transformation Department 
will mastermind bank-wide digital transformation ― from drawing up 
strategic plans to overseeing execution.In addition to making bold investments, KDB plans to recruit and appoint 
talented staff with the requisite digital expertise to work on innovative 
projects. Our goal is to successfully redesign the overall business process 
by applying the latest technological developments, such as incorporating 
data science, into corporate banking, KDB’s key business area.
Alongside digital transformation, we are also pursuing a set of internal 
innovation. KDB has in part employed a smart office system to transform 
the workplace into an entirely tech-savvy business environment. Such 
schemes of internal innovation are being developed from various angles 
with the goal of improving our business processes and establishing a 
healthy organizational culture.Third, KDB will put the needs of its clients first.
“We heed voice of clients” is at the top of the list of KDB Way, a new set 
of guiding principles of the Bank. As such, KDB will pay a close attention 
to the opinions of our clients; empathize with their real-life concerns; 
put heads together to find the best solutions for them; and act as a 
messenger to the government to voice their problems and bring about 
policy reforms.
KDB NextRound will be diversified into Special Rounds focusing on a 
particular industry or sector, and Global Rounds specifically designed 
for firms that are seeking to do, or are already doing, business abroad. 
We will also introduce new modes of communication to facilitate active 
discussions among the participants of the Rounds. Likewise, we plan 
to expand our horizons to create new platforms similar to the KDB 
NextRound, with an aim to encourage various market players to create 
new ideas, and to build a strong supply chain for key industries.Lastly, KDB will secure stability and persistence in policy finance. 
We are now in an era in which constant exposure to risk, including the 
COVID-19 pandemic, has become the new normal. In these unprecedented 
times, KDB will ensure stability and continuity in performing the 
duties required of KDB as a policy bank by undertaking higher levels of 
preemptive risk management, and by proactively preparing effective 
countermeasures against risk.
In order to brace for after-effects of COVID-19, we will provide financial 
services to innovative industries so that we can enhance the industrial 
competitiveness of Korea and thus be ready for the very different future 
which awaits us. We will also reinforce the foundations of our business 
by expanding our global network, including in Southeast Asia.
To fulfill the policy financing mandate, KDB, as an advanced policy bank, 
will secure new growth engines by fostering industries and companies 
concentrated on innovative growth, and will also continue working to 
improve the fundamentals of major industries and companies. 
I ask for your on-going support and encouragement as KDB continues to 
tread new paths towards innovation.
Thank you.Lee, Dong Gull

REVIEW OF 2019   In 2019, growth in the global economy was limited by slowing production and investment 
from major economies, including China and the Eurozone, and by the deepening US-China trade dispute. On 
top of that, the trade conflict with Japan was also a grave risk factor specifically for the Korean economy.In response to such challenges, KDB provided preemptive financial support for small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs) and medium-sized enterprises (MEs), thereby bringing greater vitality to the whole 
economy. We also sought to solidify the foundations for the sustainable growth of the Korean economy by 
actively reaching out to SMEs and MEs in areas of innovative growth. In addition, we set up a task force to 
enhance Korea’s industrial competitiveness over mid-to long-term in response to the prolonged Korea-Japan 
trade conflict. The Bank thoroughly analyzed the impact on industrial sectors that have been most affected by 
the trade conflict, and has suggested effective countermeasures.As Korea’s leading policy finance institution and corporate banking specialist, KDB has increased financial 
support for basic industries, including materials, parts, and equipment, helping them improve their overall 
competitiveness. The Bank is also actively supporting business realignments through syndicated and 
leveraged finance. In addition, the Joint Support Council for Overseas M&A and Investments, composed of 14 
institutions including KDB, has been established, in order to provide comprehensive joint support for overseas 
M&A and investments by Korean companies. Moreover, KDB’s efforts also include supporting regional job 
programs, preemptive corporate restructurings, and the 4th Industrial Revolution.KDB plays an active role in shaping the economic and industrial policies of Korea in partnership with 
government agencies and other policy finance institutions. The Bank is at the forefront of creating an

financial services for SMEs and MEs. The Bank will use special loan programs to provide them with much-
needed liquidity, thereby invigorating the economy as a whole. In addition, KDB will overhaul its credit review 
practices by moving away from a focus on collaterals and adopting dynamic credit review methodologies 
based on the growth potential of a company, which will enable the Bank to actively support the growth 
and development of innovative SMEs and MEs. KDB will also boost the customized financing extended to 
advanced industries, and will help corporate clients with their business realignments and competitiveness 
improvements by offering syndicated and leveraged finance. Through these endeavors, we ultimately seek 
to secure the growth engine for the national economy and to expand our capabilities as the nation’s leading 
policy finance institution.Corporate Restructuring
REVIEW OF 2019   Based on its profound expertise in corporate banking, KDB has led many corporate 
restructuring cases in Korea since the Asian financial crisis of 1997. The Bank acts as a safety net for the 
Korean economy and its major industries by supporting principle-based and effective restructurings, focusing 
on the early recovery of target companies. In particular, the Bank responds promptly to potential insolvencies 
of major corporate groups which could have a major impact on the national economy, thereby playing its role 
as a market safety net and improving the fundamentals and competitiveness of Korean businesses.KDB strives to minimize the negative impact of the slowdown in core industrial sectors on the Korean 
economy, while helping individual companies improve their business fundamentals. Moreover, in the case of 
Dongbu Steel, we were able to attract a third-party investor in 2019, bringing the restructuring process which 
had lasted some five years to an end. The Bank also encouraged a voluntary M&A of Asiana Airlines in order 
to prevent insolvency and to create opportunities for a rebound.In addition, KDB has invested in the Corporate Restructuring Fund, in partnership with other financial 
institutions, with the goal of supplying liquidity to the market and encouraging voluntary and preemptive 
restructurings.PLANS FOR 2020   In 2020, KDB will continue to adhere to its practice of principle-based corporate 
restructuring in order to facilitate the early recovery of distressed companies and act as a market safety net. 
In particular, the Bank will leverage its extensive experience and expertise in corporate restructuring to help 
companies undertake voluntary structural realignments and make financial improvements, thus avoiding 
insolvencies and improving competitiveness. We will also take prompt and efficient measures to ensure 
the effective restructuring of financially distressed companies, which will not only enable those companies 
to revive their operations but will also contribute to revitalization of the Korean economy and industrial 
ecosystem.BUSINESS REVIEW027Capital MarketsDebt Capital Markets
REVIEW OF 2019   KDB is the only bank in Korea with a license to arrange corporate bond offerings. On the 
back of this privilege, the Bank arranges and/or underwrites the issuance of domestic securities, arranges 
the issuance of international bonds, and provides advisory services on structured finance.In 2019, KDB supplied a substantial amount of foreign currency to the Korean economy by arranging public 
offerings and private placements of corporate bonds in international markets. Specifically, we became the 
first Korean institution to arrange a public bond offering for Korea Gas Corporation in international markets. 
We also arranged the issuance of sustainability bonds of Mirae Asset Daewoo, which was the first of its kind 
from a Korean securities firm, and the issuance of green bonds of Hanwha Energy USA, thereby facilitating 
funding for social and green projects.In structured finance, KDB provided customized finance to SMEs and MEs through the securitization of 
accounts receivables, real estate, and other assets. In addition to typical structured finance based on 
accounts receivables, the Bank diversified its range of underlying assets for structured finance to include 
redeemable convertible preference shares (RCPS).Landmark deal of 2019

more bond issuances in non-USD currencies for clients who are sensitive to interest rates. In structured 
finance, the Bank will provide specialized financial products by diversifying its range of underlying assets 
to include RCPS, PF loans, and intellectual property rights, while continuing to provide existing structured 
finance products centered around private placement notes and accounts receivables.M&A
REVIEW OF 2019   KDB provides financial advisory and M&A services to domestic and overseas companies, 
while also arranging financing for corporate clients to enable them to secure necessary funding and improve 
their capital structures.There was an increase in transaction volumes in the Korean M&A market in 2019 as a result of active business 
reorganizations at large companies and increases in investments from major private equity funds (PEFs). 
KDB, first of all, provided M&A advisory services to the companies within its restructuring portfolio. For 
example, Dongbu Steel was able to close its M&A deal thanks to KDB’s efforts to attract a third-party investor 
and perform debt rescheduling despite the challenging environment caused by the stagnant steel industry. 
The Bank also advised on the sales of investment portfolios of PEFs, namely Panax Etec. In addition, it has 
strengthened its cross-border M&A advisory capacities through partnerships with major international advisory 
firms, including Perella Weinberg Partners in the US, thereby helping Korean companies grow overseas.PLANS FOR 2020   In 2020, large companies are expected to expand their businesses through the acquisition 
of overseas companies. In response to such a trend, KDB will boost its target-sourcing capacities by 
strengthening ties with relevant organizations and by establishing other global channels. This will strengthen 
support for overseas expansion of Korean companies through cross-border M&A.Moreover, KDB will expand its M&A advisory services in support of innovative growth and industrial 
reorganization, and will actively provide consulting services in conjunction with M&As. The Bank will provide 
comprehensive M&A advisory services to its SME and ME clients through the KDB M&A Consulting Platform1), 
and will also expand its post-merger integration (PMI) consulting connected to M&A advisory work.Consulting
REVIEW OF 2019   Since 2003, KDB has been involved in over 800 consulting projects across a wide range 
of sectors, including management & finance, public service & development, in-house, overseas, and corporate 
turnarounds. The Bank leverages its expertise and experience across industries, as well as its extensive 
corporate databases and partnerships with other institutions in order to provide the most optimal solutions to 
clients.1)   An online platform whichcovers extensive M&A-related

experts of KDBIn 2019, KDB focused on growth diagnostics and business strategy consulting for companies in their growth 
and maturity phases as a part of its efforts to offer the clients distinguished consulting service tailored to 
each phase of the business life cycle. We also offered corporate diagnostics and turnaround consulting for 
companies in financial distress. In addition, we established the KDB M&A Consulting Platform, based on 
which we actively responded to demand from SMEs and MEs for M&A advisory and consulting services. The 
scope of our consulting business has expanded to include consulting on overseas expansion of domestic 
companies and PMI consulting. Moreover, we launched the Corporate Growth Advisor Program2), and thereby 
offered SMEs and MEs expert financial advices in order to help them grow and innovate.BUSINESS REVIEW029PLANS FOR 2020   In 2020, KDB will proactively respond to rising demands for cutting-edge consulting 
services by utilizing its superior start-up support system, and will continue to offer well-customized solutions 
for each phase of the business life cycle. Against the backdrop of slowing global economic growth, and an 
urgent need to foster innovative start-ups and SMEs & MEs to boost the nation’s economic vitality, KDB will 
stand by them and offer the best solutions for innovation and growth.Private Equity
REVIEW OF 2019   Since the beginning of its private equity business in January 2005, KDB has set up 28 PEFs, and 
has built up an extensive track record in fund management, including buy-out, growth, and mezzanine financing. As 
of the end of 2019, total capital commitments amounted to KRW 3,293.6 billion, with 12 funds under management. 
KDB ranks fifth in Korea as measured by total funds committed, with a market share of approximately 3.9%.Total capital commitmentsCapital commitments                      Market share (%)(As of December 31, 2019; Unit: KRW billion)ABCDKDB9,850.69.311.77,805.16.33,633.93,293.65,309.84.33.9In a low interest rate environment, funds continued to flow rapidly into PEFs, chasing for higher rates of return. 
As a result, as of the end of 2019, the number of PEF managers in Korea had increased to 304, and total capital 
commitments amounted to around KRW 84 trillion. Consequently, large PEFs have become important players in 
major M&A transactions. In addition, new forms of transactions are being created, including secondary market 
transactions whereby investment targets are bought and sold amongst PEFs.In these market conditions, KDB has sought to increase rates of return by adjusting its portfolio of project funds, 
including the KDB-Trinity DHIC PEF and KDB Value PEF VI, and blind pool funds such as the KDB Value PEF VII 
and KDB Sigma PEF for Corporate Financial Stability II. In addition, the Bank has continued to discover and invest 
in innovative companies and promising environmental and energy companies through the existing KDB Small 
Medium Mezzanine PEF and Infrastructure Initiative 1st PEF. The Bank also participated as a major investor 
through the KDB Asia PEF in a fund managed by the International Finance Corporation, thus contributing to 
infrastructure and industrial projects in Asian developing economies, including Bangladesh and Myanmar.PLANS FOR 2020   Although the Korean PEF market is growing rapidly in size, it is becoming harder for the 
market participants to reap higher rates of return due to the fierce competition for profitable investment targets. 
Market liquidity is thus becoming highly concentrated to few top-tier managers, intensifying the competition 
among managers.KDB will seek out more investment opportunities into material, parts, and equipment sectors for its blind pool 
funds dedicated to SMEs and MEs, and will also form new blind pool funds which provide tailored equity financing 
to companies starting new businesses or expanding overseas, as well as to companies planning M&A deals. Over 
the longer term, the Bank will leverage its successful management know-how earned from the ECOREA PEF and 
Infrastructure Initiative 1st PEF, which have invested in infrastructure assets in the environmental and energy 
sectors, to build a network with major overseas institutions and form blind pool funds for investment in Southeast 
Asian infrastructure markets.030Corporate Banking &

Leading Innovative Growth
As the leading policy finance institution of Korea, KDB is strengthening its support system for innovative growth, 
with the Innovation & Growth Banking Division performing a central role in this task. The Division acts as the 
chief coordinator for innovative growth policy finance, nurturing an active start-up ecosystem and facilitating 
financial support for innovative growth.Establishing a System for the 4th Industrial Revolution
REVIEW OF 2019    In 2019, growth in the global economy slowed further and external business conditions 
deteriorated significantly. As a result, there has been an unprecedented emphasis in Korea on enhancing 
economic vitality through innovative growth in order to reduce the negative impact of global uncertainty and 
volatility. Such a trend led policy finance institutions to preemptively support innovative SMEs and start-ups 
in order to develop new drivers for growth for the Korean economy, and to help establish a robust economic 
system centered on SMEs and start-ups.In March 2019, New Growth Policy Finance Council, which comprised of 10 policy finance institutions, was 
upgraded to the Innovative Growth Policy Finance Council, which now includes four government ministries1) and 
11 policy finance institutions2). This action has greatly strengthened the support system for innovative growth 
policy finance.The Innovative Growth Policy Finance Center, a department of the Bank, acts as the secretariat for the 
Innovative Growth Policy Finance Council, and is in charge of proposing policies and establishing measures for 
collaboration so that the government, policy finance institutions, and private financial institutions can effectively 
support innovative growth and sectors connected to the 4th Industrial Revolution. The Center collects and shares 
model cases of successful innovative growth support with the aim of creating an environment that is more 
conducive to innovative growth. It also oversees and manages the Common Criteria for Innovative Growth, with 
the goal of providing effective financial support for innovative growth. The Criteria are the universal standards 
adopted by policy finance institutions for supporting innovative growth and the 4th Industrial Revolution, and 
are designed to remove any potential inefficiencies in policy support for innovative growth, such as omission, 
unequal distribution, and redundancy.The 2020 Common Criteria for Innovative Growth which is in effect from January 2020 classifies the innovative 
growth into 9 major themes, 46 sectors, and 300 items. This year’s revision was conducted by the Advisory 
Team on the Common Criteria for Innovative Growth, which consisted of leading experts from each industry and 
technology sector. New items were added to reflect the latest trends in technology and market demand, and 
existing items underwent a thorough verification process for more precise definitions. Moreover, some items 
were merged to make the classification more efficient.KDB will accelerate  
the innovative growth of  
the Korean economy by leading 
the response to rapid changes 
in the business environment 
and market needs.BUSINESS REVIEW031Breakdown of the 2020 Common Criteria for Innovative GrowthThemeNumber of

to collect and analyze innovative growth policy finance data. This is the first platform ever to integrate data 
among Korean policy finance institutions. The System collects from the institutions data on the implementation 
performance of innovative growth policy finance, along with corporate employment and financial data, and 
uses it to update the Criteria, assess the status of policy finance implementation, and analyze the number of 
jobs created and value-added. In addition, a wide range of in-house and external reports on innovative growth 
industries are offered through a comprehensive innovative growth information service platform.PLANS FOR 2020   KDB will continue to cooperate closely and actively with government ministries, including 
the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Financial Services Commission, in order to support innovative 
growth of the Korean economy. The Bank will update the Common Criteria for Innovative Growth as and when 
necessary so that they reflect the latest government policies, as well as global demand and technology trends. 
In addition, we will work to expand the user pool of the Criteria to include not only policy finance institutions, 
but also the government and private financial institutions. Moreover, KDB will strive to increase financial 
support to the areas of innovative growth, and thus serve as a catalyst for the transformation of the industrial 
structure of Korea into one which is centered on promising innovative companies with outstanding creativity and 
technological prowess.Indirect Investment
REVIEW OF 2019    KDB provides companies with customized funding according to the growth phase of each 
individual company. The funding is supplied via private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) funds managed by 
private fund managers. The Bank has established the Growth Support Fund and the Growth Ladder Fund in 
order to support government policy. It is also leading the VC market in Korea by forming impact and regional 
investment funds which support innovative start-ups and growth in areas where private participation is lacking. 
The Growth Support Funds are aimed at start-ups and SMEs & MEs in their growth or exit phases, and are 
expected to grow to KRW 8 trillion in size by 2020. KDB formed 18 Growth Support Funds totaling KRW 2.9 
trillion in 2018, and 19 more totaling KRW 2.8 trillion in 2019.In October 2019, KDB formed the YD-SK-KDB Social Value Fund, an impact fund which aims to invest in 
companies with sustainable business models, while simultaneously addressing social and environmental 
issues. This fund, worth KRW 50 billion, is one of the largest of its type in Korea, and KDB has committed KRW 
20 billion, along with SK Group, SKS PE, and Yellowdog as limited partners. In September, KDB formed the 
Moonlight Venture Fund worth KRW 25 billion in collaboration with local governments to promote the regional 
economy. This regional investment fund was formed to invest in SMEs and start-ups in Daegu and Gwangju, and 
is expected to contribute to balanced regional growth.032Corporate Banking &

to start-ups and SMEs, and support the 4th Industrial Revolution. In particular, the Bank plans to form a fund 
totaling KRW 400 billion dedicated to the materials, parts, and equipment industries in response to prevailing 
economic circumstances in Korea and overseas. Additional regional investment funds will be formed in order 
to spread innovative growth into regional economies, and new impact funds will stimulate the growth of 
the domestic impact fund ecosystem. KDB will thus actively perform its role as Korea’s leading investment 
institution, fostering an innovative start-up ecosystem through an ample supply of venture capital.On-lending
REVIEW OF 2019    On-lending is a market-friendly, indirect policy finance tool specifically developed for SMEs 
and MEs. Financial intermediaries request KDB for funds on behalf of their SME and ME clients, and then KDB 
supplies the intermediaries with long-term funds, after reviewing the qualifications of each client.In 2019, through the on-lending program, KDB supplied a total of KRW 7.6 trillion to 7,397 qualified SMEs and 
MEs. 41.1% of the supplied funds was directed to companies with low credit ratings, and 63.9% was provided 
with maturities of three years or longer, thus helping SMEs and MEs add more competitive edge. In addition, 
two programs specially designed to actively support government policies ― the Special On-lending for Innovative 
Growth Facility Investment and the Special On-lending for Biohealth ― were released in July and October, 
respectively.On-lending loans supplied by yearPLANS FOR 2020   In 2020, KDB will raise the on-lending loan limits on innovative growth and the 4th Industrial 
Revolution, in order to support of the future industries and innovative companies. It will also launch new programs, 
namely Special On-lending for Materials, Parts, and Equipment Industries, to help small businesses facing 
hardships from trade disputes get back on their feet. In addition, KDB will step up the total volume of special on-
lending programs aimed at creating jobs and boosting regional economies. The Bank will also build an online 
platform for on-lending users and end-borrowers which will improve online accessibility for financial intermediaries 
and corporate clients, and ultimately build a more user-friendly on-lending infrastructure.BUSINESS REVIEW033Venture Finance
Venture & Technology Banking
REVIEW OF 2019    KDB began to make direct investments in venture capital (VC) in 1997 which was the 
very beginning of Korea’s venture capital market. Since then, KDB has led the market by investing in equity, 
convertible bonds (CBs), and bonds with warrants (BWs) issued by promising start-ups and SMEs. The Bank has 
recently increased its investments in companies leading the 4th Industrial Revolution and those with outstanding 
technologies, in line with government policies discovering and developing new engines for innovative growth.In order to identify and foster potential unicorn start-ups in Korea, in April 2019, KDB formed the Mega-7 Club, 
a joint investment council consisting of KDB and Korea’s leading seven venture capital firms. The Club has so 
far arranged six rounds of investor relations (IR) opportunities for 10 companies which were hand-picked by the 
Club members.In May 2019, KDB formed the Alzheimer’s Open Innovation Alliance in order to support Korean biotech start-ups 
which experience difficulties during new drug development processes due to a lack of expertise in development, 
clinical studies, and commercialization. In October, the Alliance hosted a forum that was attended by around 
220 participants from companies, the academic sector, and the media. Attendees actively exchanged their 
fresh ideas on drug development from technical and managerial angles. In addition to forming the Alliance, 
KDB has invested KRW 14 billion in four start-ups that are conducting research on Alzheimer’s, thereby further 
strengthening its interest in promising new biotech start-ups.In 2019, KDB implemented Value Chain Pooling investments targeting companies in the major industries of 
the 4th Industrial Revolution. After identifying key companies in the value chains for various industry sectors 
including but not limited to hydrogen energy, smart factories, Alzheimer’s treatment, and next-generation 
mobility, new investments totaling KRW 44 billion were made. This achieved more than simply improving the 
value of individual companies, as it contributed to enhancing the overall value of each industry. In addition, 
investments were made into promising companies in the parts and materials industries, in order to infuse 
much-needed vitality into the Korean manufacturing sector and contribute to the balanced growth throughout 
the country.KDB has been a loyal 
partner of start-ups from 
the beginnings of the 
venture capital market 
in Korea, and is helping 
small giants grow into

REVIEW OF 2019    KDB NextRound is a market-driven venture investment platform that provides start-ups 
with the opportunity to attract investments, and investors with the opportunity to discover investment targets, 
thus connecting start-ups with investors. Since its launch in 2016, 325 IR rounds were held for a total of 
1,171 companies, introducing start-ups which had been identified by accelerators, venture capital firms, and 
government-funded research institutes to domestic and overseas venture capitals. Of these companies, 250 
successfully attracted investments totaling KRW 1,450.8 billion. In 2019, KDB NextRound held special global 
rounds in collaboration with overseas venture capitals, as well as special rounds targeting particular industries

Korea’s leading venture investment platform.KDB NextRound in ShanghaiThe Chairman delivering opening remarks at NextRise 2019, SeoulBUSINESS REVIEW035In addition, KDB hosted “NextRise 2019, Seoul” on July 23-24 to help ventures and start-ups attract investment 
and seek business cooperation opportunities. This B2B investment fair connected ventures and start-ups with 
domestic and overseas investors, and accelerated business cooperation between large companies, MEs, and 
start-ups. It was co-hosted by KDB, Korea International Trade Association, Korea Venture Business Association, 
Korean Venture Capital Association, and National Research Council of Science & Technology, with participation 
from domestic and overseas venture capitals, large companies, and MEs. There were around 13,000 visitors 
during the two days of the event, which saw participation from 194 start-ups and 47 domestic and overseas 
large companies and investors, making it one of the largest global start-up fairs ever to be held in Korea. It was 
thus a great success in helping to enhance the globalization and vitality of the Korean venture capital market.KDB operates special-purpose funds to support the development of the Korean venture capital market. In 2019, 
the Bank formed the Global Partnership Fund IV, to help innovative Korean start-ups enter global markets and 
attract overseas investments. The Fund provides Korean start-ups access to global venture capital networks. 
Moreover, the Fund was successful in attracting private capital as investors, making it an important example 
of win-win cooperation between large companies and start-ups. In addition, the KDB Open Innovation PEF II 
was formed to identify opportunities for joint growth between MEs in regional areas and start-ups and venture 
capitals in metropolitan areas. With the size totaling KRW 21.1 billion, the PEF acts as a bridge connecting 
regional MEs to the metropolitan start-up ecosystem. KDB also formed the LOTTE-KDB Open Innovation Fund 
worth KRW 62.7 billion, in collaboration with the LOTTE Group. This fund will help Korean start-ups grow into 
unicorns, and will also enable large companies to discover new growth drivers. Specifically, the Fund will ensure 
a strong partnership between large companies and start-ups, and will support growth of start-ups through new 
investments, technology alliances, distribution channels, M&As, and utilization of the global networks of large 
companies.KDB is also running a technology development-transfer-commercialization network for the industry-academia-
research sectors. By hosting the KDB TechConnect Days, the Bank connects technology suppliers, such as 
research institutes, universities, and start-ups, with those needing advanced technologies, including large 
companies and MEs, thereby facilitating technology transactions and M&As. KDB has also signed MOUs with 
research hospitals to support the commercialization of medical technologies, and to facilitate innovative start-
ups in the bio and health care sectors. There has been a total of 21 KDB TechConnect Days, with an average 
participation of around 40 organizations and 70 attendees each time. Moreover, KDB TechConnect Days have 
led to two technology innovation-oriented M&A deals, and new investments worth KRW 16.9 billion.PLANS FOR 2020    In 2020, KDB will focus on establishing a venture ecosystem which supports the 
government’s policies for developing innovative growth industries and facilitating start-ups. The Bank will 
continue to operate KDB NextRound, while making additional efforts to expand the venture ecosystem 
nationwide in response to the increasing and changing demands from both start-ups and investors. In addition, 
the Bank plans to join FRONT1, an innovation hub set to open in the first half of 2020, and work to incubate 
and accelerate early-stage start-ups as part of its efforts to foster the national innovative start-up ecosystem. 
Moreover, “NextRise 2020, Seoul” is expected to be double the size of the 2019 event as part of KDB’s 
commitment to supporting the growth of start-up companies in Korea, and making it one of the leading global 
start-up fairs in Asia over the long term.036Corporate Banking &

Domestic Project Finance
REVIEW OF 2019    KDB provides comprehensive financial solutions for project finance (PF), including 
social overhead capital (SOC), power, plants, and natural resources sector as well as regional development 
projects. The Bank also offers financial advisory and arrangement services for shipping and aviation financing. 
Since 1995, when it successfully arranged financing for the construction of the Incheon International Airport 
Expressway, KDB has led the development of the Korean PF market. It has always been at the forefront of 
the advances in Korea’s PF market, while fulfilling its policy roles in supporting the expansion of the national 
infrastructure, improving energy supply, and fostering the regional economies by leveraging the creative 
capabilities of the private sector, and by attracting long-term investments from other financial institutions.In 2019, KDB arranged project financing for 43 projects ― 13 SOC and 30 real estate projects ― totaling 
KRW 9.6 trillion. For the SOC sector, financing totaling KRW 4.4 trillion was arranged for new and refinancing 
projects, including Dongbuk Light Rapid Transit, Busan Mandeok-Centum Expressway, and the Gwangbaek 
100MW photovoltaic power generation and ESS project, thereby contributing to the vitalization of the domestic 
infrastructure market. In the real estate sector, KDB invigorated regional economies by arranging financing 
totaling KRW 5.3 trillion, including the Cheongju Technopolis general industrial complex project, the Goyang-
Jichuk cooperative-type commercial rental housing project, and the Yeongam-Haenam tourism & leisure-type 
enterprise city development project.PLANS FOR 2020    In the SOC sector, KDB plans to develop project schemes where financial investors and 
engineering firms take more initiatives in project development, in a sharp contrast to previous approaches 
whereby large construction firms took the central role. We will also fulfill the government’s new energy policies 
in the renewable energy market and lead sustainable finance by supporting small-to mid-sized photovoltaic 
projects and offshore wind farm projects. In the real estate sector, KDB will expand financial support to 
industrial complex, urban development, and logistics center construction projects. We will also increase our 
participation in environmental improvement projects, such as improving outdated industrial complexes and 
undertaking urban regeneration, as well as public housing projects in order to support government policies 
aimed at strengthening the national economy.KDB will continue to 
contribute to the robust 
growth of the Korean 
economy, and grow into 
a leading global PF house 
based on 25 years of 
experience and know-how.BUSINESS REVIEW037Overseas Project Finance
REVIEW OF 2019    KDB entered the overseas PF market in 2003, and has since created an overseas deal 
sourcing network by setting up PF desks headed by highly-skilled local experts in Singapore in 2011, in New 
York in 2015, and in London in 2016. After arranging financing for four projects in 2006, including Oman 
Aromatics Refinery, KDB fully launched its overseas PF business in 2011. As of the end of 2019, the Bank 
arranged financing for 144 overseas projects totaling USD 12.1 billion.In 2019, KDB arranged financing for 28 overseas PF projects, worth USD 2,285 million, and 48 projects, worth 
USD 5,640 million, in the shipping and aviation sectors. Financings in major developed economies included the 
Silvertown Tunnel Project in the UK and the America Oberon 1A Project in the US. In developing nations, the 
Bank led the post-delivery financing for Angolan Sonangol Drillship Project, and a UT-1 216MW Hydropower 
Project in Nepal. It also saw a solid performance in shipping and aviation financing by successfully providing 
finance for seven new LNG carriers in GasLog LNG Shipping Financing Project and arranging AerDragon Aviation 
Portfolio Financing for 10 aircrafts. In addition, Nitrogen 1.2GW Portfolio Financing in the US, the Silvertown 
Tunnel Project in the UK, the Saudi Arabian Dumat Al Jandal Onshore Wind Power Project, and ADNOC pipeline

F/X & Derivatives Trading
REVIEW OF 2019    KDB has been pioneering the Korean trading market since the 1980s when F/X and 
derivatives products were scarce in Korea. In 1998, KDB led the development of the KRW interest rate swap 
and KRW/USD currency option markets, and has been a leader in the KRW derivatives market ever since. Over 
some 30 years, we have built up broad expertise required to deal in a wide variety of products, ranging from F/X, 
swaps, options, and other basic derivatives to complex structured derivatives, which enables us to provide hedging 
solutions tailored to each client’s needs.2019 saw short- and long-term yield curve inversions in the US bond market, on the backdrop of the prolonged 
US-China trade dispute. This was widely interpreted as a sign of a potential economic downturn, and resulted 
in additional volatility in global financial markets. The Bank of Korea therefore cut its base rate twice in 2019, 
causing the USD/KRW exchange rate to exceed KRW 1,200 at one point.Despite this challenging environment, KDB leveraged its extensive experience and expertise to offer hedging 
products customized to the specific needs of its clients. Upon entering an agreement with the Korean government, 
the Bank became a market maker for greenhouse gas emissions trading, making its first transaction in June 
2019, and has since contributed to reductions in bid-offer spreads and price volatility. In addition, we offered 
derivatives, such as currency swaps, to overseas investment funds in order to facilitate domestic asset 
managers’ investments into offshore real estates, aircrafts, etc.Moreover, we provided training courses to working-level personnel at SMEs and MEs with the goal of boosting 
their F/X and interest rate risk management capabilities. We also offered interest rate swaps, which converted 
floating rate loans to fixed rate, along with F/X risk advisory services which helped SMEs and MEs improve their 
competitiveness. Besides that, KDB has actively played its role as a market maker by entering into currency 
swap transactions with foreign currency-denominated bond issuers and ultimately supplying foreign currency 
liquidity to the domestic currency swap market.KDB will contribute to the 
development of the national 
economy and sustain its 
growth momentum by 
leveraging the experience 
it has accumulated in the 
global trading market over 
many years.BUSINESS REVIEW039PLANS FOR 2020    Market conditions are forecast to remain highly volatile in 2020 with the global and 
domestic economy experiencing the worst downturn in decades. KDB will focus on expanding its sales network 
and providing a wider range of products and services customized to the needs of its clients in order to help them 
run their businesses smoothly. Besides increasing derivatives transactions with offshore non-residents, KDB will 
also offer structured products developed in-house to meet the specific needs of its clients. The Bank will also 
proactively respond to global changes in regulations and market rules. We will adopt a new calculation system 
in preparation for the new initial margin rules that are expected to take in effect from September 2020, and also 
prepare for the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates. Finally, KDB will continue to act as a market 
maker for the greenhouse gas emissions trading market, as well as engage in policy consultations and advisory 
services, while continuing to support SMEs and MEs with their risk management capabilities.Money Market & Capital Market Trading
REVIEW OF 2019    KDB leverages its overseas financial networks, namely New York and London Branches, 
to employ a round-the-clock trading system, enabling it to stay ahead of market volatility at home and abroad. 
Following the opening of the Chinese stock market to foreign investors, KDB became the first Korean bank to 
win Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) and RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) licenses 
in 2009 and 2015, respectively. This has helped the Bank to make active inroads into securities markets in 
China and other emerging markets. In addition, KDB was designated as a primary dealer (PD) for the Korea 
Treasury Bonds in 1999, and has since contributed to the healthy growth of primary and secondary markets. 
The Bank’s hard work and dedication towards the task was rewarded with five consecutive years (2015-2019) of 
commendation from the Minister of Economy and Finance.In 2019, KDB maximized returns and minimized risks from volatility by implementing flexible hedging and 
duration adjustment strategies. We also improved our liquidity management by increasing the proportion of our 
investments in AA or higher-rated corporate and sovereign bonds.PLANS FOR 2020    Global economy in 2020 is expected to be hit hard by a sharp drop in private consumption 
and investments as well as disruption in global supply chains. We also foresee heightened volatility within the 
global financial market until the world begins to recover from this economic turmoil. Against such backdrop, 
KDB will lock in sound profits through preemptive risk management and portfolio diversification by utilizing 
investment grade papers. Specifically, we will seamlessly collect and analyze global financial market data to stay 
ahead of the market and be prepared for any market disruption. In China, we will continue to keep our assets 
diversified in stocks, bonds, MMF, and CD, and work together with our local branches to respond flexibly to 
market changes. Moreover, KDB will continue to play a vital role in the domestic securities market by supporting 
the bond issuances of its clients and undertaking its privileged duty as a primary dealer.040Corporate Banking &

Active Overseas Expansion
KDB plays a leading role in the globalization of Korean financial institutions, and is leveraging its overseas 
networks in order to support the government’s New Southern Policy. The Bank supports domestic companies 
in their efforts to advance into global markets, and also offers its clients a comprehensive range of corporate 
banking services, including loans, bond issuance, PF, M&A, shipping & aviation financing, consulting, and 
derivatives, based on the know-how it has accumulated over many years in international financial market.KDB has 26 overseas locations across 19 countries ― one regional head office, nine branches, five subsidiaries, 
nine representative offices, and two expatriate employees ― and continues to pursue a globalization strategy 
by expanding its overseas network and diversifying its operations. In 2019, KDB increased its presence in 
Southeast Asia, a region with high growth potentials. As a part of its move to support New Southern Policy 
and expand its global presence, the Bank opened the Jakarta Representative Office in March. We also joined 
the ASEAN Plus Three Inter-Bank Cooperation Mechanism (APTIBCM), and entered into an MOU with the 
Vietnamese Ministry of Finance when the ASEAN-Republic of Korea Commemorative Summit took place in 
November. In addition, a new Sales & Syndicate Desk was set up at KDB Asia Ltd., located in Hong Kong, in 
order to better serve our Asian clients and further expand our global network. With the Asia Regional Head 
Office located in Singapore overseeing business strategies for the Asian region, we continued to expand our 
operations and move deeper into the Asian financial market.In 2020, KDB will leverage its global business capabilities to provide active support for the globalization of 
Korean financial institutions and the implementation of the government’s New Southern Policy. In particular, we 
will prioritize Southeast Asia, given that Korean companies are actively entering this fast-growing market and 
there is significant demand for PF and infrastructure investments. The Bank will, first of all, establish networks 
and strengthen its market presence in Indonesia and Myanmar.Backed by its strong 
global networks and 
business competencies, 
KDB will support the 
overseas expansion of 
Korean businesses and 
lead the globalization of 
Korea’s financial industry.The Launching Ceremony of Jakarta Representative OfficeBUSINESS REVIEW041Cross-Border Syndicated Loans
In 2019, KDB improved its profitability and increased its high-quality overseas assets by actively entering 
emerging markets. The Bank arranged deals for Ctrip.com (China), Reliance Industries (India), Emirates NBD 
Bank P.J.S.C. (U.A.E), Commercial Bank PSQC (Qatar), PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (Indonesia), and Doha Bank 
Q.P.S.C. (Qatar), thus leading Korean financial institutions into the global financial market. Of particular note 
was the arrangement of a USD 1 billion syndicated loan for PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara, an Indonesian state 
electricity corporation. This deal was structured through general syndication, involving sell-downs, with global 
top-tier investment banks, and enabled KDB to gain a strong foothold in Indonesian financial market.KDB will move forward to proactively support the New Southern Policy in 2020 by boosting its presence in global 
syndicated loan markets, with a particular focus on emerging economies in Asia. It will work in partnership with 
global financial institutions, and will develop specific strategies for each target country, with a focus on their 
growth industries. This will establish a strong overseas presence for KDB, and further enhance its reputation in 
global markets.Trade Finance
KDB offers comprehensive trade finance services to domestic companies through a wide range of products, 
including letters of credit (LC), documents against acceptance (DA), documents against payment (DP), and 
open account (OA). In addition to traditional export & import finance, the Bank trades with global banks in risk 
participation, and provides trade finance credit lines which are guaranteed by major international financial 
institutions to banks from emerging nations. The total trade loan volume more than quadrupled by the end of 
2019 since we first began our trade loans business in 2018. On the other hand, growth in the volume of exports 
and imports declined in 2019 due to uncertainties in the global economy. Under such a challenging environment, 
our overall export & import finance volume fell slightly year-on-year to USD 33 billion. However, KDB’s leading 
position in the domestic trade finance market was well marked by its strong market share, currently ranked fifth.Export and import financing supplied to Korean companies by year(Unit: USD billion)Import                     Export20192018201714.916.613.333.135.619.032.318.219.0Despite continued uncertainties at home and abroad, including the on-going US-China trade dispute and slowing 
growth in major economies, KDB will expand its trade finance business in 2020 by providing comprehensive 
trade finance services to its clients. We will also increase the volume of our risk participation trade, and diversify 
the pool of banks for trade loans business, thereby broadening our asset base and business scope.042Corporate Banking &

As of the end of 2019, KDB ranked 11th in terms of pension assets under management (AUM) among 43 
domestic pension operators in Korea. KDB’s pension AUM increased by 10.6% from 2018, reaching KRW 
6.4 trillion at the end of 2019. The pension market is expected to grow further on growing attention to post-
retirement finances in an era of aging population, low-growth, and low-interest rates.True to its mission and legacy, KDB is committed to government pension policies and the stable growth of 
Korea’s retirement pension market. Specifically, KDB will hone its strategies to respond effectively to the fast-
evolving retirement pension market as well as boost its pension asset management capabilities. Moreover, 
in 2020, KDB will continue to further expand its market share by launching new products, increasing rates of 
return through portfolio optimization, and enhancing online user experience through IT system upgrades.Pension assets under management10.6%201920182017(Unit: KRW billion)6,3815,7685,279The strength of KDB’s 
pension & trust operations 
lies in the expertise and 
know-how we have long 
accumulated as Korea’s 
leading corporate banking 
specialist.BUSINESS REVIEW043Trust
KDB began its money trust business in 1989, and then expanded into property trust and custody business over 
the years. The Bank guarantees post-retirement financial security to retail customers through stable rates of 
return and tax benefits. It also offers its corporate clients comprehensive money and property trust service 
aimed at efficient management of company assets. Moreover, through its custody business, the Bank actively 
supports funding activities of the corporate clients by acting as an agent bank.In 2019, in tandem with the active marketing of banks and product launches, total trust balance of the entire 
banking industry grew 8% year-on-year. For instance, KDB freshly rolled out USD-denominated money market 
trust (MMT), the first of its kind for the Korean banking industry. This new product was well received by the 
corporate clients, leading to a surge in corporate MMT balance. We facilitated funding operations of SMEs and 
MEs through accounts receivables trusts, while also actively carrying out policy financing roles by supporting 
distressed companies through the utilization of bankruptcy-remote trusts. As a result, KDB attracted KRW 
5.4 trillion in property trust from SMEs and MEs in 2019. For our custody business, we actively marketed to 
policy finance funds, resulting in a year-on-year increase of 8.0% in the average balance of investment fund 
assets. There was also a year-on-year increase of 20.2% in the average balance in the agency business, mainly 
attributable to the growth of syndicated loans.Trust assets balance14.3%201920182017Custody balance2.0%201920182017(Unit: KRW trillion)31.127.228.6(Unit: KRW trillion)26.1
25.622.6While the property trust market is expected to grow further in 2020, the money trust market is forecast to see 
slowing growth due to tightened regulations on equity linked trusts. Product development and marketing for 
money trust products will therefore be focused more on consumer protection, rather than on profitability.KDB plans to improve the IT system for its money market trust business, and expand the domestic and overseas 
sales networks for its property trust business. For the custody business, we will actively target investment funds, 
and will bring more proficiency and efficiency to the agency service by placing more emphasis on syndicated loans.044SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW045SUSTAINABILITY

KDB supports the stable growth and sustainable development of  
the national economy through flexible and timely funding in domestic 
and global markets.KDB Bonds
KDB issues Industrial Finance Bonds (KDB Bonds) in KRW and foreign 
currencies in order to procure necessary funding for the development 
and promotion of industries, expansion of social infrastructure, 
regional development, stabilization of financial markets, and facilitation 
of sustainable growth, etc., in accordance with the Korea Development 
Bank Act. As stipulated in the Act, KDB is protected against insolvency 
by the government as a state-owned policy bank, and its credit risk 
is treated equal to that of the government under Basel III. As a result, 
KDB Bonds are issued at the lowest spreads against the benchmarks 
compared to any other domestic special bonds (bonds issued by public 
organizations) or financial institution (FI) bonds.KRW-denominated    Despite the Bank of Korea’s base rate cuts in 
July and October, Korean bond market exhibited weak signs throughout 
the second half of 2019, mainly attributable to an upward yield trend 
driven by anticipation of a resolution to the US-China trade dispute, 
and the foreign investors’ shorting of Korean treasury bond futures. 
Notwithstanding this increased volatility, KDB successfully achieved 
its annual issuance target, thus securing the financial resources much 
needed for policy finance. In 2019, new KDB Bonds were issued for a 
total of KRW 46.6 trillion, and the outstanding balance stood at KRW 
94.9 trillion at the end of the year.The issuance volume of KDB Bonds has been increasing steadily, and 
the total outstanding balance is the third largest in Korea behind Korea 
Treasury Bonds and Monetary Stabilization Bonds, making KDB the 
largest issuer in the domestic bond market excluding government 
organizations. Moreover, the bond yield rates of KDB Bonds are widely 
used as benchmarks for domestic bonds, alongside those of Korea 
Treasury Bonds and Monetary Stabilization Bonds.KDB is also the largest issuer in the Korean structured note market, 
accounting for 56% of the market. In 2019, the Bank issued 22 
structured notes worth KRW 590 billion, leading to lower overall 
funding costs. In addition, KDB issued KRW-denominated sustainability 
bonds totaling KRW 400 billion, becoming the first domestic institution 
to issue all three types of ESG bonds ― green, social, and sustainability 
bonds. KDB also promoted socially responsible financing by issuing 
social bonds worth KRW 400 billion in support of job-creating 
companies.SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW047In 2020, KDB’s funding strategy will continue to focus on flexibility, 
bracing for potential volatility in the market caused by changes in base 
rates and geopolitical risks. As well as continuing to be active in USD-
denominated global bonds, KDB will constantly monitor markets in 
order to serve as Korea’s benchmark borrower across various markets, 
including EUR, JPY-denominated bonds, etc. The Bank will also make 
concerted efforts to improve funding conditions for Korean issuers by 
expanding the SSA investor base for Korean papers.Market interest rate of major domestic bonds

diversifying its products and broadening the investor pool. It will also 
keep supplying new ESG bonds to the market and help the domestic 
ESG bond market, which is still in its infancy, grow bigger. In addition, 
the Bank will ensure a stable supply of capital for the development and 
promotion of industries through flexible, timely funding.Foreign currency-denominated    Despite three rate cuts by the 
U.S. Federal Reserve and increased volatility in financial markets 
in 2019, KDB was able to secure foreign currency funds totaling 
USD 5.5 billion by actively identifying and meeting investor needs. 
In particular, the Bank issued global bonds and EUR-denominated 
green bonds, thus establishing benchmarks for other Korean issuers’ 
foreign currency funding. Moreover, the Bank diversified its funding 
channels by entering niche markets, including Kangaroo bonds and 
BRL-denominated notes. This has reduced our dependence on the USD 
market, and has attracted supranational, sub-sovereign, and agency 
(SSA) investors from different regions. On top of that, KDB promoted 
socially responsible finance by setting up the KDB Sustainable Bond 
Framework and issuing EUR-denominated green bonds worth EUR 
500 million in support of new & renewable energy projects. This deal 
was chosen as the “Best Green Bond ― Bank” at The Asset Triple 
A Sustainable Capital Markets Regional Awards 2019, thus further 
enhancing KDB’s reputation as a leading policy finance institution.Jan. 2017Jul. 2017Jan. 2018Jul. 2018Jan. 2019Jul. 2019048Liability Management

KDB ensures the efficient supply of policy funds by taking deposits to 
supplement KDB Bonds, which can be sensitive to market conditions. 
By attracting money market accounts and other low-cost deposits, the 
Bank diversifies away its funding risks and reduces its funding costs, 
thus enhancing its competitiveness as a policy bank.Despite increased global economic volatility and intensified 
competition among banks following the full implementation of open 
banking services in December, KDB’s total deposits rose by KRW  
1.7 trillion ― KRW 1.3 trillion from corporate and KRW 0.4 trillion from 
retail customers ― in 2019, thanks to the launch of distinctive non-
face-to-face products. In particular, the Bank attracted some 46,000 
new accounts through the KDB x T high5 Installment Savings product, 
launched in alliance with a fintech company.Banks are being required to reduce household loans and increase 
corporate loans due to the new loan-to-deposit ratio regulations 
which will come into force in 2020. However, considering limitations 
on adjusting their loan portfolios over such a short period, banks are 
attempting to attract more deposits, which in turn will lead to more 
intense competition in the deposit-taking market.Against this backdrop, KDB will leverage its strength as a corporate 
banking specialist to expand its deposit services and financial support 
for SMEs and MEs. The Bank will also expand its wealth management 
services for premier customers, and train more private banking 
(PB) specialists. In addition, in the face of a digital era, the Bank will 
strengthen its partnerships with fintech companies in order to provide 
high-quality non-face-to-face banking services.Liquidity Management
For effective liquidity management, KDB makes various investment 
decisions for its liquidity pool by closely monitoring market conditions 
and flexibly adapting to internal supply-and-demand swings. KDB 
undertakes preemptive risk management measures to minimize 
liquidity gaps and maintain an optimal level of liquidity. The Bank 
employs diverse short-term instruments, such as call loans and money, 
repo, MMF, and CP programs, to efficiently manage its excess liquidity. 
In addition, it maintains extensive USD Money Market Lines with 
numerous central banks and multiple Reciprocal Money Market Line 
Agreements with global financial institutions to secure stable sources

through the effective management of a diverse range of risks based on 
fundamental principles of risk management.Risk Management Methodologies
Credit risks    Credit risks refer to possible losses in the event that debts 
cannot be collected as a result of a failure of counterparties to make 
repayments or to fulfill their payment obligations in other ways. While 
monitoring all assets that are exposed to credit risk, we also measure 
and manage credit concentration risk, which can occur as a result of 
excessive exposure to individual companies or corporate groups.Market risks    Market risks refer to possible losses to the Bank’s 
assets resulting from fluctuations of interest rates, stock prices, F/X 
rates, and other variables. KDB measures and manages possible losses 
in trading positions, including positions in securities and derivatives 
held for trading, due to negative movements in market indices. 
Moreover, we classify the severity of market changes into three stages 
― precautionary, semi-crisis, and crisis stages ― and operate Market 
Risk Contingency Plans appropriate to each of the three stages. KDB 
also conducts stress tests to measure the potential scale of losses 
based on scenarios replicating significant fluctuations in major market 
indices over the last three years and the financial crisis in 2008.Interest risks    Interest rate risks refer to possible losses due to 
interest rate fluctuations that cause a decrease in net present value 
(NPV) or net interest income (NII) of rate-sensitive assets and an 
increase in interest expenses on rate-sensitive liabilities at the Bank’s 
accounts. KDB manages interest rate risks mainly through Value at 
Risk (VaR), and also employs Earnings at Risk (EaR), duration gap, and 
repricing gap as auxiliary management indices.Liquidity risks    Liquidity risk is defined as the possibility of potential 
loss due to a temporary shortage in funds caused by a maturity 
mismatch or an unexpected capital outlay. Liquidity risk soars when 
funding rates rise, assets are sold below a normal price, or a good 
investment opportunity is missed. KDB uses Basel III’s short-term 
liquidity regulation index, the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), and a mid to 
long-term liquidity regulation index, the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) 
to manage its liquidity risks and to meet regulatory requirements.KDB’s Risk Management Principles•   Risk must be managed in a manner that is independent,comprehensive, and uniform on a bank-wide basis;•   Risk must be accurately identified, measured and evaluated, andthen properly managed;•   Risk must be maintained at a level in balance to profit;
•   Risk must be diversified to prevent a buildup of assets concentratedin a specific category; and•   Risk must be managed within certain limits or guidelines in order toprevent undue exposure.Effective Risk Management  
by Specialized Councils
KDB operates independent risk management committee and council 
to ensure prompt and effective risk management decision-making. The 
Risk Management Committee (RMC) is KDB’s highest decision-making 
body that examines important matters such as yearly risk management 
plans and total risk limits for the Bank. The RMC members are mainly 
comprised of independent directors with extensive experience and 
knowledge in finance and economic matters. Chaired by one of the 
independent directors, the Committee is armed with a decision-making 
mechanism that ensures balanced views on critical risk management 
agenda. All agenda items resolved by the RMC are reported to the 
Board of Directors.In 2019, a total of 21 agenda items were presented for discussion to 
the Committee. Major agenda items adopted for resolution included 
the risk management plans for 2019, and the country exposure 
management plans. Other important risk management issues were 
also reported to the Committee, including the analysis report on bank-
wide stress test results and verification report on the BIS capital ratio.The Risk Management Council is comprised of Division Heads, and its 
roles and responsibilities include the monitoring of the Bank’s constant 
risk variables, and the orchestration of operations, so that risks can 
be effectively managed within each operation unit. Following the limits 
set by the Committee, the Council discusses and distributes the risks 
among Divisions, sets limits for trading losses and F/X positions. 
In 2019, the Council was convened nine times with agenda items 
including the credit portfolio management plans and the distribution of 
internal capital limits.050Liability Management

occur due to inadequate internal procedures, failed system, employee 
errors, as well as external events that disrupt business processes. 
Through a Control Self-Assessment (CSA) program implemented 
at three-month intervals, we make sure that the relevant staff at 
each department is fully aware of the potential operational risks 
associated with their job functions, and can properly manage those 
risks. We established business continuity plans for each job function 
to prepare for potential disruptions due to disasters, strikes, and 
other emergencies. Annual mock drills are held to ensure that major 
operations can be resumed within a target timeframe in the event of 
an emergency.Asset Soundness Management 
KDB  categorizes  the  soundness  of  its  assets  as  “normal”, 
“precautionary”, “substandard”, “doubtful”, or “estimated loss” based 
on an evaluation of the possibility of insolvency and sets loan loss 
provisions according to the categorization. Starting from 2018, the 
Bank makes reasonable estimates of the probability of defaults as 
well as loss given defaults, and sets aside adequate level of loan loss 
provisions using the expected credit loss (ECL) impairment model in 
line with the International Financial Reporting Standards 9 (IFRS 9).KDB constantly strives to minimize the insolvencies and puts 
necessary measures into place, including requiring additional collateral 
and the early collection of debts. If assets become non-performing, 
we seek possibilities for business recoveries, or manage the assets 
through sales or write-offs.Review of 2019    In 2019, KDB expanded its pool of high-quality assets 
under adequate risk control through the operation of its credit exposure 
limit system. It also overhauled designation criteria for Stressed Sectors 
so as to ensure effective risk management. In addition, the Bank 
established risk management measures for market making activities 
for the greenhouse gas emissions trading market, thereby improving 
its market risk management functions. It also established processes 
through which it can forecast future liquidity ratios and adjust its highly 
liquid asset portfolio in order to improve its liquidity risk management 
capacities. Moreover, the risk management infrastructure was upgraded 
by integrating the business continuity plan (BCP) centers into one, and 
improvements to IT systems made BCP implementations and mock 
drills more effective.Plans for 2020    In preparation for the Basel large exposures 
framework to be adopted in 2021, KDB will set appropriate credit 
exposure limits by each corporate group based on thorough analysis of 
unique risk factors of each group. In addition, the Bank will build a new 
system to ensure smooth adoption of new Basel regulations for the risk-
weighted assets which will come into force in 2023.KDB is verifying its evaluation models and strengthening internal 
controls in response to new initial margin requirements for non-
centrally cleared derivatives. Moreover, KDB will actively respond 
to changing regulations and market environments resulting from 
the adoption of the Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) 
standards in 2020. As such, we will continue to make practical and 
reasonable risk-based decisions based on timely risk analyses and 
efficient operations of risk management bodies.SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW051IT & Digital Transformation
KDB will fulfill its roles required for a policy finance institution  
in the digital era through digital innovation of its products and services, 
and through digital transformation of the way it works.Beginning of the Digital KDB Era
2019 saw the full launch of the digital finance era in Korea. Financial 
companies competed to become the first to launch financial services 
which make use of new information technologies, including big data, 
artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. In response to such a trend, 
KDB successfully completed its new Next Generation Information 
System. Moreover, it also constructed the KDB Digital Square on a 
16,784 m2 site in Hanam-si, Gyeonggi-do, which is another significant 
milestone indicating that the Bank has successfully completed its 
preparations for a digital era.Next Generation Information System
KDB embarked on its Next Generation Information System project in 
April 2017, for which the total workforce exceeded 1,600 engineers 
during the full project term of 26 months. 90% of the existing IT 
system was redeveloped, and the new system began operating in 
May 2019. Work productivity has been greatly improved, thanks to 
the streamlined workflow-based user interface, adoption of electronic 
forms, and systems integration. In addition, customer convenience 
has been increased significantly through the introduction of biometric 
authentication, integration of customer data, and 24/7 availability.KDB Digital Square
KDB began construction of its new data center in July 2017 in order 
to secure state-of-the-art IT capacities. The project was completed in 
June 2019 after 24 months, and the center was named “KDB Digital 
Square”, embodying the determination of KDB to transform to a digital 
bank. Located in Hanam-si, Gyeonggi-do, the center consists of a six-
story IT center and a nine-story office building.Integrated document

data capabilities, a key tool for digital transformation. In addition, 
to foster fintech companies and industry, KDB will work with other 
fintech companies to develop new open API business models. We will 
also actively seek investment opportunities for outstanding fintech 
companies so that we can perform a pivotal role in the nurturing of 
fintech ecosystem and the digital transformation of Korean industries. 
In order to cultivate a young, lively, and smart organizational culture, 
more innovations will take place in 2020 such as adoption of paperless 
office, improvement of workplace communications, and promotion of 
knowledge management.KDB  Digital  Square  is  designed  to  accommodate  the  high-
performance/large-capacity IT systems which have recently become a 
necessity. A network cabling structure and containment system have 
made cooling more efficient, and non-stop power supply system and 
base isolation structure will maintain business continuity even in the 
event of a disaster. Moreover, KDB Digital Square was awarded Tier III 
Certification of Design Documents by Uptime Institute, in recognition 
of its top-level stability and efficiency. Equipped with cutting-edge 
smart offices and multi-level security, KDB Digital Square will serve as 
an outpost for KDB in the digital era, taking the lead in KDB’s digital 
strategies, R&D, and process innovations.Digital Transformation
In 2019, KDB established “S.M.A.R.T”, a digital transformation 
strategy specialized for corporate banking. Based on this strategy, we 
focused on providing non-face-to-face services to our corporate clients 
using online channels, building a financial platform to enable start-
ups, SMEs, and MEs to attract investments, and supporting fintech 
companies. In addition, a robotic process automation (RPA) pilot 
project was launched to automate standard, repetitive work by using 
a software robot. RPA will be expanded to enable staff to concentrate 
on more creative, higher value-adding work. Moreover, a pilot smart 
office project is also underway to create a more open, horizontal 
organizational culture through spatial innovation.SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW053Research & Credit Review
As Korea’s leading think tank for industry and technology, 
KDB supports innovative growth and sustainable development 
of the Korean economy, and suggests the direction for 
economic development on the Korean Peninsula.Industry & Technology Research
KDB undertakes comprehensive research on industry and technology, 
including industry sector ratings and outlook, technology reviews, and 
Technology Credit Bureau (TCB) evaluations. This function serves two 
purposes: effective risk management for the Bank and enhancement 
of industrial structure for the whole economy. These roles are expected 
to become ever more important in the fast-changing era of the 4th 
Industrial Revolution.In 2019, KDB’s research focus was on new industries and technologies, 
such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, as well as finding 
ways for traditional major industries to hone their competitiveness. 
It also carried out in-depth analysis of the impact that Japan’s export 
controls have on major industries, including semiconductor, display, 
and electric vehicles, and suggested potential solutions for each 
industry sector. Moreover, KDB continued to serve as a leading tech 
evaluation center in 2019 based on the Level 4 TCB Certification it has 
received from Korea Credit Information Services in 2018.In 2020, KDB will step up its efforts for research in innovative 
growth so that Korea can maintain its leadership in the 4th Industrial 
Revolution, while also carrying on with its research for major industries. 
In addition, the Bank will increase the number of target industries 
and speed up the procedure for industry sector ratings, and make 
improvements to its TCB reporting system.Credit Review
In 2018, KDB adopted “Credit Review System for New Industries 
and Innovative Companies” to better respond to the diverse funding 
needs of innovative companies at various growth stages. In 2019, 
the Bank organized special teams dedicated to credit review of new 
industries, and adopted an agile credit review methodology. Under 
this methodology, experts visit innovative companies and conduct 
credit reviews on-site, providing the companies the opportunity to 
explain their business plans and technologies in-person. Through these 
approaches, KDB actively supports innovative companies which have 
earned recognition for their innovation and potential for growth, but 
have not had timely access to capital due to lack of a proven track 
record. In addition, the Bank has been strengthening its management 
of corporate group exposures, by setting working capital credit limits 
for every large exposure. The Bank is also enhancing its credit review 
system through utilization of an integrated database which provides 
comprehensive information on industries and corporate groups.In 2020, in line with its global expansion plans and the New Southern 
Policy, KDB will gradually boost its credit review capacities in major 
business hubs, including Singapore and Hong Kong. Moreover, we will 
further enhance our credit review expertise by running comprehensive 
training programs for in-house credit specialists.Research on Reunification Finance
KDB conducts in-depth research on North Korea’s economy and 
industries in order to support the government’s “New Economic Map 
of the Korean Peninsula”. It also researches the means of inter-Korean 
economic cooperation in anticipation of smooth progress of North 
Korea’s denuclearization. Although North Korea-US denuclearization 
negotiations did not lead to an agreement in 2019, the negotiation 
process pointed to many possibilities for the future. The government 
has been striving to build foundations for an inter-Korean community 
based on the New Economic Map of the Korean Peninsula, and KDB 
has accordingly put significant efforts into research in preparation 
for the resumption of economic cooperation. The Bank also hosted 
the 27th seminar of the North Korea Policy Forum on the theme of 
joint growth for the two Koreas through start-up cooperation, with 
top experts on North Korea discussing inter-Korean exchange and 
cooperation.In 2020, vigorous efforts will continue to be made for peace on the 
Korean Peninsula and across Northeast Asia by the two Koreas and 
their neighbors, including the US, China, and Russia. KDB will widen 
its research into North Korea’s economy and industries in order to 
realize a successful and peaceful economy on the Korean Peninsula. 
It will also actively support government policies by cooperating with 
domestic and overseas research institutes and international financial 
institutions.054Liability Management

KDB prioritizes ethical management with a particular focus on  
customer protection in a bid to spread fairness and transparency  
within the organization.Compliance 
Review of 2019    KDB has built an effective internal control system 
to ensure that it abides by regulations, prevents any financial incident, 
and fulfills its anti-money laundering obligations. It continues to 
make improvements to its anti-corruption infrastructure, and runs a 
wide range of compliance programs to practice a bank-wide ethical 
management. Regular training is provided to employees in order to 
boost ethical awareness, and to build a fair and transparent workplace.In 2019, the government emphasized the importance of ethical 
management for the public sector in order to fully establish public 
integrity, and to spread a culture of respect for human rights and mutual 
cooperation. KDB received integrity consulting from the Anti-Corruption 
& Civil Rights Commission, and overhauled its internal regulations, 
including the Code of Conduct. As a result of such endeavors, the 
government upgraded the Bank’s integrity evaluation rating by one notch 
in 2019. In addition, we built a human rights management system to 
meet the new obligations imposed on public institutions starting from 
2019, and made a joint labor-management declaration on human rights 
management. We also operate internal and external report centers for 
gapjil1), and conduct surveys with our partners and clients to prevent 
any damage or take corrective actions, in an active response to the 
government’s commitment to eradicating gapjil.KDB also made improvements to its anti-money laundering infrastructure. 
The Bank successfully integrated its anti-money laundering function to 
the Next Generation Information System, and also amended internal 
regulations and self-checklists on anti-money laundering for its overseas 
networks. Moreover, system improvements are being consistently made 
to prevent transactions which are in violation of international sanctions 
including those imposed by the US and UN.1)  Abuse of power by someone against a person in a weaker positionPlans for 2020    Social demand for ethical management will further 
increase in 2020, especially demands for stemming gapjil, respecting 
human rights, and increasing integrity. Internal control systems will also 
be further upgraded in order to ensure that all internal and external 
regulations are observed.KDB will therefore continue to strengthen its efforts around anti-
corruption and ethical management, including human rights 
management and gapjil eradication. It will adopt a human rights 
impact assessment system for its management activities in order to 
prevent human rights violations and gapjil. It will also increase the 
efficiency of its integrity policies by making its compliance-related IT 
systems more convenient, and will strengthen internal control systems 
at overseas branches to ensure full compliance to local regulations. 
Compliance reports will be overhauled to focus on local regulations, and 
communication and coordination between local compliance officers 
and headquarters compliance staff will be further strengthened.Furthermore, KDB will ensure that its anti-money laundering activities 
are always in line with ever-tightening global standards. We will closely 
monitor suspicious transactions and carefully check for any beneficial 
ownership. We will also support anti-money laundering efforts at our 
branches through regular on-site inspections.SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW055Major compliance management programsProgramsDetailsCompliance monitoringConducts monitoring on compliance reports, self-inspection reports from branches, and monthly

Review of 2019    KDB continuously strives to improve its consumer 
protection systems in response to the ever-strengthening standards for 
financial consumer protection.KDB has established a consumer protection process for each phase 
of the product life cycle ― from development to sales and post-sales 
stages. We regularly examine across all phases for any factor that may 
impinge on consumer rights in order to prevent improper or incomplete 
product sales. The product development and sales departments 
communicate seamlessly by sharing up-to-date information on recentconsumer protection issues through the Financial Consumer Protection 
Council. As a result of these efforts, KDB has earned “Excellent” ratings 
across all categories of the “Evaluation of Consumer Protection Status” 
conducted by the Financial Supervisory Service every year.We have also set up a coherent complaint handling system to address 
customer complaints more promptly. We are also working to reduce 
the number of complaints by analyzing the root cause of the most 
frequent complaints, providing in-depth training on complaints 
handling, and distributing a checklist for complaints prevention.056Liability Management

KDB seeks to recruit forward-looking global talent driven by passion and 
determination, and also possessing the qualifications and sense of ethics 
needed to lead the development of the Korean financial industry.Fair and Competency-driven  
Recruitment System 
KDB hires new employees every year in order to respond effectively 
to the ever-changing economic and business environments, and 
to strengthen its organizational competencies. We ensure equal 
opportunity and fairness in our recruitment process by adopting 
“blind recruitment” practices. Recruitment is driven above all by job 
competencies, with an emphasis on a candidate’s basic capabilities and 
organizational fit within the financial industry.KDB hired 35 new employees in 2019, all of whom had undergone 
a multi-dimensional evaluation at each stage of the hiring process in 
line with National Competency Standards (NCS). We increased the 
proportion of new employees with digital, technological background, 
including computer science, big data, and biotech. These talented new 
recruits will take the lead in shaping the future of Korean industries in 
the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution.Programs to Foster Digital Talent
KDB is making extensive efforts to recruit and train interdisciplinary 
talent who can lead the digitalization of finance. It is triggering a bank-
wide digitalization by providing special lectures and coding classes 
to its employees. The Bank is also running digital immersion courses 
in collaboration with colleges and other educational institutions. In 
addition, KDB offers a wide range of opportunities for employees 
to expand their knowledge both inside and outside their current job 
functions. It offers personalized career development programs and in-
house training courses for each job function and level of proficiency. 
In particular, the Bank enables its employees to learn anytime and 
anywhere by offering online courses at the KDB e-Campus or through 
other online training providers.KDB also runs a range of overseas programs to develop global talent. 
KDB offers programs aimed at training regional specialists in countries 
where the Bank is planning to expand, and which have strong potential 
for growth, including Indonesia and Vietnam. Moreover, selected 
employees also receive on-the-job trainings at KDB offices in New York, 
London, and Singapore.Strengthening Job Competencies
We segment job functions at KDB into 172 categories with the aim 
of maximizing organizational competencies through enhancement of 
individual job competencies. We support employees in their individual 
development through a wide range of personalized career development 
programs (CDPs) which are divided into exploration, development, and 
master phases. Employees in the exploration phase can improve their 
skills in their own job functions while also gaining experience within 
other areas. Subsequently, more support is given to employees to help 
them further develop their expertise as they move towards the master 
phase.For specialized job positions requiring higher level of expertise, positions 
are filled through a competitive in-house recruitment process. In 
2019, KDB recruited staff for positions in project finance (PF), regional 
development, shipping and aviation finance, M&A, private equity fund, 
VC, DCM, credit review, consulting, and portfolio management. The 
Bank also operates an open position system which emphasizes the 
importance of expertise, and imbues the Bank’s organizational culture 
with added vitality. In 2019, KDB proceeded with in-house and external 
recruitment to hire qualified experts in four areas ― PF, litigation, risk 
management, and industry & technology research ― and thus continued 
its efforts to secure distinguished experts in each field.058Liability Management

in large infrastructure and industrial projects are effectively identified, and 
appropriate measures are put in place to mitigate risk in a structured way. 
In 2019, our dedicated team undertook E&S due diligence on more than 40 
projects and transactions. KDB provided multiple rounds of staff training and 
hosted many seminars in order to raise awareness of EP, and to ensure that EP 
are maintained consistently throughout the Bank.As Korea’s first and only bank to adopt the EP to date, KDB is expanding its 
outreach activities to help disseminate and advance E&S risk management 
practices. During the course of the year, we shared our experiences in E&S risk 
management with other Korean banks that have shown interest or have taken 
preliminary steps to become a signatory of the EP. At the 2019 Annual Meeting 
of the EP Association where the fourth version of the EP (EP4) was launched, 
KDB stepped up to take on the leadership role of EP4 transition coordinator. 
Responsibility includes overseeing the issuance of supplementary guidance 
documents before the EP4 becomes effective in July 2020.KDB will continue to improve the rigor of its internal procedures in order to 
manage the E&S risks of the projects it finances. The priority for 2020 will be 
the effective implementation of EP4 across the Bank’s operations, which will in 
turn enable us to guide our clients in addressing emerging E&S risks.KDB's E&S risk management processNew project-relatedtransactionsProject financeCorporate loansE&S riskcategorizationCategory A (High risk)Category B (Medium risk)Category C (Low risk)E&S due diligence(in conjunction with credit review)Compliance review againstthe EP requirements (commensuratewith project’s risk category)Monitoring and reportingFinancing documentationClient conducts monitoring and

be used for environmental improvement and job creation projects. This 
sustainability bond follows the issuance of KRW-denominated green and 
social bonds in 2018, and is contributing to the development of the Korean 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) bond market. KDB allocated 
77.5% of the proceeds to social projects, such as job creation, and 22.5% to 
green projects, such as photovoltaic and wind power. The number of target 
companies for social projects was 88, and the total number of employees at 
those companies rose from 19,533 at the end of 2017 to 22,119 at the end 
of 2018, an increase of 13%. The total annual reduction in CO2 emissions 
resulting from green projects is expected to be 125,372 tons, of which KDB’s

in three areas – socially responsible finance, community 
service, and talent development. The following projects 
run by the Foundation reflect KDB’s commitment to 
creating social value through sustainable finance.In 2019, a total of 455 teams applied for “KDB Start-up 
Program”, a program supporting start-ups run by young 
people, and 25 teams were chosen to participate in the 
final round. They were provided with a range of training 
programs, including professional start-up training, 
mentoring, and venture capital support. 7 teams were 
finally selected to be offered start-up funds totaling KRW 
180 million, as well as other follow-up programs. Since 
its launch in 2013, the Program has selected 131 teams, 
103 of which were successful in launching their business, 
creating 1,350 jobs, and generating cumulative sales 
of around KRW 76 billion. The “KDB Entrepreneurship 
Support Program” also began in 2013, and it aims 
to spread a start-up business culture among college 
students. In 2019, 1,051 students from 26 colleges 
across the nation participated in the program.In 2019, KDB provided start-up fund loans to 12 small 
businesses through the ‘KDB Microcredit Fund’, which 
helps underprivileged people build more stable finances. 
In addition to financial support, the Bank offered 
management consulting and one-on-one mentoring to help 
these businesses generate strong sales and profitability 
after their launch of business. KDB is also helping people 
excluded from the financial services become financially 
independent, with the goal of expanding the infrastructure 
for inclusive finance. The project was launched in 2005, 
and as of the end of 2019, a total of 224 start-up loans 
have been provided, thus expanding the social safety 
net and helping the underprivileged to become more 
economically independent.“KDB Social Economy Enterprise Support Program” aims 
to support the creation of jobs for the underprivileged. In 
2019, we provided 19 social enterprises with resources for 
facility investments, as well as customized mentoring on 
marketing, finance, and labor. This program has supported 
a total of 47 social enterprises since its launch in 2015, 
and has created jobs for 139 people, thereby contributing 
to the establishment of a sustainable ecosystem for social

refers to Korea’s adoption of the standards and interpretations released by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The 
2019 financial statements of KDB cover financial performance from January 1 to December 31 of the year, and the financial figures in 
this Management’s Discussion & Analysis (MD&A), unless specified otherwise, are based on consolidated financial statements.2019 Review
The global economy saw slowing growth in 2019, with total world output up by 2.9% according to International Monetary Fund (IMF), 
and 3.6% the year before. This was caused by several factors, including uncertainties due to the US-China trade dispute and Brexit, an 
economic slowdown in a number of emerging markets, and wider geopolitical tensions, which caused major economies, including the 
US, the Eurozone, China, and India to achieve a lower GDP growth rate in 2019.The Korean economy likewise experienced slower growth. Factors affecting growth included reduced investment in plant & equipment, 
continued sluggishness in construction, and lackluster growth in exports. Overall consumption rose by 3.1%, with a major contribution 
from government spending, but the overall GDP growth rate recorded 2.0%, down from 2.7% in 2018. Inflation for the year was 0.4%, 
compared to 1.5% in 2018, and the current account surplus fell from USD 775 billion in 2018 to USD 600 billion in 2019, mainly due to 
a reduction in the volume of global trade.According to preliminary figures from the Financial Supervisory Service, the combined net income of the Korean banking industry 
in 2019 was KRW 14.4 trillion, down from KRW 15.6 trillion in 2018. This decline was mainly due to increases in selling, general and 
administrative (SG&A) expenses and impairment losses at subsidiaries. Nevertheless, the industry saw further improvements in its 
asset quality, as evidenced by a decrease in loan loss provisions and a rise in NPL coverage ratios.In 2019, KDB focused more on the new growth and innovative industries associated with the 4th Industrial Revolution in order to fulfill 
its roles and responsibilities as Korea’s leading policy finance institution and to ensure the stability and revitalization of the national 
economy. “KDB NextRound”, which was launched in 2016, continues to be a success as an investment platform linking promising start-
ups with potential investors and venture capital companies at home and abroad. KDB also encouraged the preemptive restructuring 
of corporate groups suffering from a temporary shortage in liquidity, and implemented effective financial measures to prevent any 
potential spread of risk.We made continuous efforts to promote the overseas businesses of Korean companies, as well as expanding our own global presence 
by managing overseas project finance transactions and establishing the Jakarta Representative Office as our business hub in Southeast 
Asia. KDB has also helped to create a positive ecosystem for start-ups, and contributed to the further development of SMEs.KDB’s position as Korea’s representative financial institution and its strong capital adequacy have been evaluated and recognized by 
the major international credit rating agencies. In 2019, KDB maintained credit ratings of Aa2 with Moody’s, AA with S&P and AA- with 
Fitch, and its BIS capital ratio stood at 14.05%.062FINANCIAL REVIEW0632020 OutlookWith the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world economy is facing unprecedented challenges and hardships. Major economies, 
including the US, Japan, and Germany, are expected to experience sharp contractions in GDP, and there are still no clear signs of a 
turnaround. Countries around the world are struggling to contain the spread of the virus, including by implementing strict measures for 
social distancing and stay-at-home, and this has already translated into severe damage to trade volumes and new investments in the 
global economy.In April, IMF forecast that world output will decline by 3.0% year-on-year in 2020, with advanced economies, such as US (-5.9%), 
Eurozone (-7.5%) and Japan (-5.2%), experiencing the highest rates of contraction. Major emerging markets, such as China (+1.2%) and 
India (+1.9%), are still expected to grow, but are expected to suffer their worst slowdown in decades.There are many predictions being made for Korea’s GDP growth rate in 2020, but forecasts range widely, from -1.2% (IMF) to +1.3% (ADB), 
as the course of the pandemic is still hard to predict and the Korean economy is heavily reliant on global trade. Private consumption 
and investments in plant & equipment are expected to slump further, and trade volume will also grow slowly in 2020, if at all. However, 
it is important to note that Korea has built a substantial economic buffer against turbulent times. Korea’s foreign exchange reserves 
stood at USD 409 billion at the end of March 2020, the 9th highest total in the world.Despite this challenging environment, KDB will continue to fulfill its role as an “Advanced Policy Bank at the Forefront of Korea’s 
Sustainable Growth” by further increasing its support for innovative industries and SMEs. KDB will spearhead progress in the era of the 
4th Industrial Revolution, invigorating the national economy and monitoring global and domestic market conditions in order to provide a 
market safety net.2020 will see a rapidly changing, volatile financial environment. KDB will therefore strive to carry out its functions as a policy bank 
based on its strong credit ratings, globally competitive financial expertise, and thorough risk management. It will also play a leading role 
in supporting the national economy throughout the COVID-19 crisis as “Korea’s Financial Platform Leading to a Bright Future”.Income AnalysisSummary Statement of IncomeNet operating revenue

763 billion year-on-year to KRW 926 billion, mainly attributable to a reduction in net interest income and an increase in G&A expenses. 
Non-operating income fell by KRW 1,793 billion compared to the previous year, mainly due to net losses from investments in associates. 
This resulted in a negative non-operating income for the year of KRW 847 billion. Moreover, KDB classified a disposal group of Daewoo

(0.8)At the end of 2019, KDB’s assets amounted to KRW 268,840 billion, up 3.4% compared to the previous year. This was mainly attributable to 
an increase in outstanding loans, which rose by 4.9% to KRW 149,927 billion.KDB’s liabilities rose by 3.5% year-on-year to record KRW 233,763 billion, mainly attributable to increases in deposits and other liabilities. 
Deposits stood at KRW 36,315 billion at year-end, up 7.0%, and other liabilities recorded KRW 47,272 billion, up 11.7% year-on-year.KDB’s issued capital increased by KRW 555 billion in 2019, with total equity standing at KRW 35,077 billion, up 2.4% compared to the 
previous year. This was the result of the issuance of new KDB shares to the Korean government during the year, as well as increases in 
capital surplus and retained earnings.LoansCorporate loansLarge enterprises

KRW 3,482 billion, as a number of major corporate clients completed their restructurings and were thus classified as precautionary. As a 
result, the NPL ratio fell from 4.23% in 2018 to 2.71% in 2019.Loan loss reserves at year-end stood at KRW 3,668 billion, down 13.9% compared to the previous year. As a result of the decrease in NPLs,

respectively at the end of 2019, down 0.75%p and 0.56%p compared to the previous year. The BIS capital recorded KRW 35.0 trillion at year-
end, up by 1.7% year-on-year, thanks to the KRW 0.56 trillion capital injection from the Korean government. Risk-weighted assets (RWA) 
went up by 7.1% to KRW 249.1 trillion, mainly attributable to changes in the calculations for RWAs associated with over-the-counter (OTC) 
derivatives, such as SA-CCR, increases in indirect investments, and the funding of corporate restructurings. The BIS capital adequacy ratio 
of KDB is well maintained above the minimum requirement of 8%.Independent Auditors’ ReportBased on a report originally issued in KoreanThe Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Korea Development BankOpinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Korea 
Development Bank and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”), which comprise 
the consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2019 and 
2018, and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated 
statements of changes in equity and consolidated statements of cash flows 
for the years then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present 
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group 
as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and its consolidated financial performance 
and its consolidated cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the Republic of Korea 
(“Korean IFRS”).Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section 
of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements in the Republic of Korea, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinionOther Matter 
Auditing standards and their application in practice vary among countries. The 
procedures and practices used in the Republic of Korea to audit such financial 
statements may differ from those generally accepted and applied in other 
countries.Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with  
Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements in accordance with Korean IFRS, and for 
such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible 
for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s 
financial reporting process.Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated  
Financial Statements
Our  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the 
consolidated  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Korean Standards onAuditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
•  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform 
audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.•  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to 
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not 
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal control.•  Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by 
management.•  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a 
material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention 
in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to 
cease to continue as a going concern.•  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated 
financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated 
financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.•  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information 
of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on 
the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible 
for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other 
matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during 
our audit.Seoul, Korea
March 27, 2020This report is effective as of March 27, 2020, the audit report date. Certain subsequent events or 
circumstances, which may occur between the audit report date and the time of reading this report,

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Korean International Financial Reporting Standards (K-IFRS) 
enacted by the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies.(2) Changes and disclosures of accounting policies(i) New and amended standards and interpretations adopted
The Group newly applied the following amended and enacted standards for the annual period beginning on January 1, 2019. The nature and the impact of 
each new standard or amendment are described below:Enactment of K-IFRS 1116 ‘Leases’
K-IFRS 1116 ‘Leases’ replaced K-IFRS 1017 ‘Leases’, Interpretation 2104 ‘Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease’, Interpretation 
2015 ‘Operating Leases-Incentives’, and Interpretation 2027 ‘Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease’.According to single accounting model for lessees of K-IFRS 1116, the Group as lessee recognized the right-of-use assets that represent a lessee’s right 
to use underlying assets and lease liabilities that represent a lessee’s obligation to make payments to the lessor. The accounting model for lessors of 
K-IFRS 1116 is similar to the model of the Group’s prior accounting policy.(a) Accounting for a lessee
A lessee shall apply this standard to its leases either (a) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented applying K-IFRS 1008 ‘Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’ (Full retrospective application); or (b) with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard 
being recognized at the date of initial application.The Group applied K-IFRS 1116 retrospectively as of January 1, 2019. However, the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 
not restated. Therefore reclassification and adjustments under the new K-IFRS were recognized in the financial statements beginning on January 1, 
2019. The details of changes in accounting policies are disclosed below.081At inception of a contract, the Group shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The Group also identify whether the contract is, or contains, 
a lease according to K-IFRS at the date of initial application. However, the contracts written before the date of initial application are permitted to applying 
a practical expedient and the Group do not have to go through all the contracts. The Group shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease based 
at the date of initial application.For a contract that is, or contains, a lease, a lessee or lessor shall account for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-
lease components of the contract. Moreover, a lessee is permitted to elect, by class of underlying asset, not to separate non-lease components from lease 
components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease component. The Group applies 
practical expedient to all (or a part of) contracts that are, or contain a lease and elects to combine non-lease components with a lease component and to 
account for them as a single lease component.A lessee is required to recognize a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset (lease assets) and a lease liability 
representing its obligation to make lease payments. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:- fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives
- variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate
- amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees
- the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option
- payments for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the leaseThe lease payments shall be discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if the rate can be readily determined. The Group has to determine 
the incremental borrowing rate if the interest rate cannot be readily determined, which defined as the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay 
to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar 
economic environment.The cost of the right-of-use asset shall comprise:
- the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability
- any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received
- any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee
- an estimate of costs restoring the siteHowever, the Group elected not to apply the requirement of K-IFRS 1116 to lease of low-value assets and short-term lease. The Group recognizes the 
lease payments associated with these leases as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term.(b) Accounting for a lessor
The lease accounting as the lessor dose not significantly change comparing with K-IFRS 1017. As a lessor, the enactment of K-IFRS 1116 does not 
have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.(c) Adjustments on K-IFRS 1116
According to K-IFRS 1116, the Group recognized the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at the date of the initial application. The adjustments on 
K-IFRS 1116 are as follows (Korean won in millions):DescriptionAssets:
Right-of-use assets included in property and equipment

Liabilities:

(65)₩₩₩₩₩₩082083The Group measured the lease liabilities using incremental borrowing rates at the date of initial application. The used incremental borrowing rates are 
1.75% to 3.26%.According to K-IFRS 1116, the Group recognizes depreciation and interest expense on behalf of rent expenses. The Group recognized depreciation of 
property and equipment amounting to ₩112,181 million and interest expense amounting to ₩12,588 million relating to lease accounting treatments.Amendments to K-IFRS 1109 ‘Financial Instruments’
The narrow-scope amendments made to K-IFRS 1109 “Financial Instruments” enable entities to measure certain prepayable financial assets 
with negative compensation at amortized cost. When a modification of a financial liability measured at amortized cost that does not result in the 
derecognition, a modification gain or loss shall be recognized in profit or loss. The amendments do not have a significant impact on the Group’s 
financial statements.Amendments to K-IFRS 1019 ‘Employee Benefits’
The amendments require that an entity shall calculate current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the reporting period after a plan 
amendment, curtailment or settlement based on updated actuarial assumptions from the date of the change. The amendments also require that a 
reduction in a surplus must be recognized in profit or loss even if that surplus was not previously recognized because of the impact of the asset ceiling. 
The amendments do not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.Amendments to K-IFRS 1028 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’
The amendments clarify that an entity shall apply K-IFRS 1109 to financial instruments in an associate or joint venture to which the equity method 
is not applied. These include long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the entity’s net investment in an associate or joint venture. The 
amendments do not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.Enactment of Interpretation of K-IFRS 2123 ‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’
The interpretation explains how to recognize and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax 
treatment, and includes guidance on how to determine whether each uncertain tax treatment is considered separately or together. It also presents 
examples of circumstances where a judgement or estimate is required to be reassessed. The enactment does not have a significant impact on the 
Group’s financial statements.Annual Improvements to K-IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle
The annual improvements to K-IFRS 1103 ‘Business Combination’ clarify that when a party to a joint arrangement obtains control of a business that 
is a joint operation, and had rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to that joint operation immediately before the acquisition 
date, the transaction is a business combination achieved in stages. Additionally, the annual improvements to K-IFRS 1111 ‘Joint Agreements’, K-IFRS 
1012 ‘Income Tax’ and K-IFRS 1023 ‘Borrowing Cost’ are newly applied. The improvements do not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial 
statements.(ii) New standards and interpretations issued but not effective
The following new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been issued but not effective for annual periods beginning 
after January 1, 2019, and the Bank has not early adopted them. The Bank is currently in progress of analyzing the potential impact on the financial 
statements resulting from the application of these standards, interpretations and amendments.Amendments to K-IFRS 1001 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and K-IFRS 1008 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors’ - Definition of MaterialThe amendments to K-IFRS 1001 and K-IFRS 1008 are issued to align the definition of ‘material’ across the standards and to clarify certain aspects 
of the definition. The new definition states that information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to 
influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide 
financial information about a specific reporting entity. The amendments are applied prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2020, with earlier application permitted.Amendments to K-IFRS 1103 ‘Business Combinations’ - Definition of a Business
To consider the integration of the required activities and assets as a business, the amended definition of a business requires an acquisition to include 
an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs and excludes economic benefits from the 
lower costs. An entity can apply a concentration test, an optional test, where substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated 
in a single asset or a group of similar assets, the assets acquired would not represent a business. These amendments should be applied for annual 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020, with earlier application of permitted.(3) Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following material items in the consolidated 
statement of financial position:- Derivative financial instruments measured at fair value
- Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss 
- Available-for-sale financial instruments measured at fair value
- Fair value hedged financial instruments with changes in fair value, due to hedged risks, recognized in profit or loss 
-  Liabilities for defined benefit plans, which are recognized as net of the total present value of defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets(4) Functional and presentation currency
In preparing the Group’s consolidated financial statements, transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group entities at their 
respective functional currency rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Korean 
won, which is also the Group’s functional currency. The following entities of the Group have different functional currency from the presentation currency:Functional currencyUSDUZS

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with K-IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Management’s 
estimates may differ from actual outcomes if management’s estimates and assumptions based on management’s best judgment at the reporting 
date are different from the actual environment.Estimates and underlying assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which 
the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.The following are the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that 
have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:(i) Fair value of financial instruments
Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss and other comprehensive income, and derivative instruments are recognized 
and measured at fair value. If the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is determined either by using a valuation technique or 
independent third-party valuation service. Valuation techniques include using recent arm’s length market transactions between knowledgeable, 
willing parties, if available, referencing to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis 
and option pricing models.Financial instruments, which are not actively traded in the market and those with less transparent market prices, will have less objective fair values 
and require broad judgment on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty in market factors and assumptions in price determination and other risks.Diverse valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, from generally accepted market valuation models to 
internally developed valuation models that incorporate various types of assumptions and variables.084085(ii) Credit losses allowance
The Group tests impairment and recognizes loss allowances on financial assets classified at amortized cost, debt instruments measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income and recognizes provisions for payment guarantee, financial guarantee and unused commitments. Accuracy 
of allowances and provisions for credit losses is dependent upon estimation of expected cash flows of the borrower for individually assessed 
allowances of loans, and upon assumptions and methodology used for collectively assessed allowances for groups of loans, guarantees and unused 
loan commitments.(iii) Deferred taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realized or the liability is 
settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred income tax assets are 
recognized to the extent that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Actual income taxes 
in the future may not be identical to the recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities,(iv) Defined benefit liabilities
The Group operates a defined benefit plan. Defined benefit liability is calculated by annual actuarial valuations as of the reporting date. In order to 
perform the actuarial valuations, assumptions for discount rates, future salary increases and others are required to be estimated. Defined benefit 
plans contain significant uncertainties in estimations due to its long-term nature.(6) Approval date for the consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on March 25, 2020, which will be submitted for approval 
to the shareholders’ meeting to be held on March 30, 2020.3.  Significant Accounting PoliciesThe significant accounting policies applied by the Group in preparation of its consolidated financial statements are included below. The accounting 
policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.(1) Basis of consolidation(i) Subsidiaries and business combinations
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has right to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power of the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which controls ceases.If a subsidiary of the Group uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and 
events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to its financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements.(ii) Investments in associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group 
holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power. Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially 
recognized at cost. The Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill (net of any accumulated impairment loss) identified on acquisition. When 
the investors’ share on the fair value of the associates’ identifiable assets and liabilities exceeds acquisition cost of the associates’ interest, the 
excess portion is recognized as the current profit for the year of acquisition.The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or loss is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income, and its share of post-
acquisition movements in reserves is recognized in reserves. When the Group’s share of loss in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the 
associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognize further loss, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments 
on behalf of the associates. The carrying amount of equity method investments and the long-term interest that partially consists of investors’ net 
investment are included in interest in the associate.Unrealized gain and loss on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate. 
Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.(iii) Acquisitions from entities under common control
The assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at the carrying amounts recognized previously in the Group controlling shareholder’s consolidated 
financial statements. The difference between cash paid and acquired net assets are recorded in equity.(iv) Non-controlling Interests
Non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are accounted for separately from the parent’s ownership interests in a subsidiary. Each component of 
net profit or loss and other comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the parent and non-controlling interest holders, even when the 
allocation reduces the non-controlling interests balance below zero.(v) Changes in the parent company’s ownership interest 
Changes in the parent company’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions 
with owners in their capacity as owners. Adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the 
subsidiary. The difference between the consideration and the adjustments made to non-controlling interests is recognized directly in equity 
attributable to the owners of the parent company.(2) Operating segments
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, 
including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. Segment results that are reported to 
the chief operating decision maker include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Unallocated items mainly comprise corporate assets (primarily the Group’s headquarters), head office expenses, and income tax assets and 
liabilities. The Group recognizes the CEO as the chief operating decision maker.For acquisitions meeting the definition of a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting is used.(3) Foreign exchangeIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at 
the acquisition date. Any goodwill arising from initial consolidation is tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the need for impairment. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured 
at acquisition date in fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed and the amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquire. Costs related to acquisition are recognized as expenses when occurred.The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the 
cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.Intra-group balances, income and expenses, unrealized gain and loss and dividends resulting from intra-group transactions are fully eliminatedA change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a change of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control 
over a subsidiary, it recognizes any investment retained at fair value and any surplus or deficit in profit or loss.(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of company entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate 
at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional 
currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognized in profit or loss, except for differences arising on the translation of available for 
sale equity instruments, a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, or in a qualifying cash flow hedge, 
which are recognized in other comprehensive income. Exchange rate effect of the gain (or loss) from non-monetary item is categorized according to 
whether the gain (or loss) is recognized as other comprehensive income or as profit or loss.(ii) Foreign operations
If the presentation currency of the Group is different from a foreign operation’s functional currency, the financial statements of the foreign operation 
are translated into the presentation currency using the following methods:Unless the functional currency of foreign operations is in a state of hyperinflation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the 
closing exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses on the statement of comprehensive income are translated at the 
exchange rates of the date of transaction. Foreign currency differences that arise from translation are recognized as other comprehensive income.086087Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation, and any adjustments in fair value to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities due 
to such acquisition, are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation. Therefore, such are expressed in the functional currency of the 
foreign operations and, alongside other assets and liabilities of the foreign operation, translated at the closing exchange rate.In the case of the disposal of a foreign operation, cumulative amounts of exchange difference regarding the foreign operation, recognized separately 
from other comprehensive income, are re-categorized from assets to profit or loss as of the moment the disposal profit or loss is recognized.(iii) Foreign exchange of net investment in foreign operations
Monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, with none or little possibility of being settled in the foreseeable future, are 
considered a part of the net investment in the foreign operation. Therefore, the exchange difference is recognized as comprehensive income or loss 
in the consolidated financial statement, and re-categorized to profit or loss as of the disposal of the related net investment.(4) Recognition and measurement of financial instruments(i) Initial recognition
The Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets is recognized and derecognized using trade date accounting.The Group classifies financial assets as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income, or financial assets at amortized cost on the basis of the Group’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow 
characteristics of the financial assets. The Group classifies financial liabilities as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, or financial liabilities 
at amortized cost.At initial recognition, a financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not 
at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.(ii) Subsequent measurement
After initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at amortized cost or fair value based on classification at initial recognition.Amortized cost
The amortized cost is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus 
or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for 
financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance.Fair value
Fair values, which the Group primarily uses for the measurement of financial instruments, are the published price quotations based on market prices 
or dealer price quotations of financial instruments traded in an active market where available. These are the best evidence of fair value. A financial 
instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, an entity in 
the same industry, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s 
length basis.If the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is determined either by using a valuation technique or independent third-party valuation 
service. Valuation techniques include using recent arm’s length market transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, if available, referencing to 
the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.The Group uses valuation models that are commonly used by market participants and customized for the Group to determine fair values of common 
over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives such as options, interest rate swaps and currency swaps which are based on the inputs observable in markets. For 
more complex instruments, the Group uses internally developed models, which are usually based on valuation methods and techniques generally used 
within the industry, or a value measured by an independent external valuation institution as the fair values if all or some of the inputs to the valuation 
models are not market observable and therefore it is necessary to estimate fair value based on certain assumptions.If the valuation technique does not reflect all factors which market participants would consider in setting a price, the fair value is adjusted to reflect 
those factors. Those factors include counterparty credit risk, bid-ask spread, liquidity risk and others.The chosen valuation technique makes maximum use of market inputs and relies as little as possible on entity-specific inputs. It incorporates 
all factors that market participants would consider in setting a price and is consistent with economic methodologies applied for pricing financial 
instruments. Periodically, the Group calibrates the valuation technique and tests its validity using prices of observable current market transactions of 
the same instrument or based on other relevant observable market data.(iii) Derecognition
Derecognition is the removal of a previously recognized financial asset or financial liability from the statement of financial position. The Group 
derecognizes a financial asset or a financial liability when, and only when:Derecognition of financial assets
Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or the financial assets have been 
transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are also transferred, or all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial assets are neither substantially transferred nor retained and the Group has not retained control. If the Group neither 
transfers nor disposes of substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets, the Group continues to recognize the financial 
asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the financial asset.If the Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset in its entirety and recognize a financial liability for the 
consideration received.Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognized from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.(iv) Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statements of financial position where there is a legally enforceable right 
to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the assets and settle the liability simultaneously.(5) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with original maturities of or less than three months’ maturity from the date of acquisition that are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, including cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other highly liquid short-term 
investments with original maturities of three months or less.(6) Non-derivative financial assets(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Any non-derivative financial asset classified as held for trading or not classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 
or financial assets measured at amortized cost is categorized under financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.The Group may designate certain financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss when the designation eliminates or 
significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as ‘an accounting mismatch’) that would otherwise arise 
from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on different bases.After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is measured at fair value and gains or losses arising from a change in 
the fair value are recognized in profit or loss. Interest income and dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are also 
recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.(ii) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
The Group classifies financial assets as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income if they meet the following conditions: 1) 
debt instruments that are a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and 
consistent with representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding or 2) equity instruments, not held for 
trading with the objective of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealer’s margin, designated as financial assets at fair value 
through other comprehensive income.After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income is measured at fair value. Gain and loss from changes in 
fair value, other than dividend income and interest income amortized using effective interest method and exchange differences arising on monetary 
items which are recognized directly in income as interest income or expense, are recognized as other comprehensive income in equity.At disposal of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, cumulative gain or loss is recognized as profit or loss for the 
reporting period. However, cumulative gain or loss of equity instrument designated as fair value through other comprehensive income are not 
recycled to profit or loss at disposal.Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate. Exchange 
differences resulting from changes in amortized cost are recognized in profit or loss, and other changes are recognized as equity.088089(iii) Financial assets measured at amortized cost
A financial asset, which are held within the business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and consistent 
with representing solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are classified as a financial asset at amortized cost. 
Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method after initial recognition and 
interest income is recognized using the effective interest method.(7) Expected Credit Loss of Financial Assets
The Group measures expected credit loss and recognizes loss allowance at the end of the reporting period for financial assets measured at amortized cost 
and fair value through other comprehensive income with the exception of financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss.The expected credit loss (“ECL”) is the weighted average amount of possible outcomes within a certain range, reflecting the time value of money, estimates 
on the past, current and future situations, and information accessible without excessive cost of effort.The Group uses the following three measurement techniques in accordance with K-IFRS:
- General approach: for financial assets and off-balance-sheet unused credit line that are not applied below two approaches
- Simplified approach: for receivables, contract assets and lease receivables
- Credit-impaired approach: for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assetsThe general approach is applied differently depending on the significance of the increase of the credit risk. If, at the reporting date, the credit risk on a 
financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, an entity shall measure the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an 
amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses. If the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, an 
entity shall measure the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date.The Group applies the simplified approach to 1) trade receivables and contract assets that do not have a significant financing component or 2) trade 
receivables, contract assets and lease receivables upon determining the Group’s accounting policies as the application of the simplified approach. The 
approach requires expected lifetime losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the financial assets. Under credit-impaired approach, the Group 
shall only recognize the cumulative changes in lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition as a loss allowance for purchased or originated 
credit-impaired financial assets.The following non-exhaustive list of information may be relevant in assessing changes in credit risk:
- Significant changes in internal price indicators of credit risk as a result of a change in credit risk since inception
-  Other changes in the rates or terms of an existing financial instrument that would be significantly different if the instrument was newly originated or 
issued at the reporting date
- An actual or expected significant change in the financial instrument’s external credit rating.
- An actual or expected internal credit rating downgrade for the borrower or decrease in behavioural scoring used to assess credit risk internally
- An actual or expected significant change in the operating results of the borrower
- Past due information(i) Forward-looking information
The Group uses forward-looking information, when it determines whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition and 
measures expected credit losses.The Group assumes the risk component has a certain correlation with the business cycle, and calculates the expected credit loss by reflecting the 
forward-looking information with macroeconomic variables on the measurement inputs.Forward looking information used in calculation of expected credit loss is derived after comprehensive consideration of a variety of factors including 
scenario in management planning, worst-case scenario used for stress testing, third party forecast, and others.(ii) Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at amortized cost
The amount of the loss on financial assets at amortized cost is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present 
value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The Group estimates expected future cash 
flows for financial assets that are individually significant (individual assessment of impairment).For financial assets that are not individually significant, the Group collectively estimates expected credit loss by grouping loans with homogeneous 
credit risk profile (collective assessment of impairment).Individual assessment of impairment
Individual assessment of impairment losses is calculated using management’s best estimate on present value of expected future cashflows. The Group 
uses all the available information including operating cash flow of the borrower and net realizable value of any collateral held.Collective assessment of impairment
Collective assessment of loss allowance involves historical loss experience along with incorporation of forward-looking information. Such process 
incorporates factors such as type of collateral, product and borrowers, credit rating, size of portfolio and recovery period and applies probability of 
default on a group of assets and loss given default by type of recovery method. Also, the expected credit loss model involves certain assumption to 
determine input based on loss experience and forward-looking information. These models and assumptions are periodically reviewed to reduce gap 
between loss estimate and actual loss experience.The expected credit loss for financial assets measured at amortized cost is recognized as the loss allowance, and when the financial asset is 
determined to be irrecoverable, the carrying amount and loss allowance are decreased. If financial assets previously written off are recovered, the 
loss allowance is increased and the difference is recognized in the current profit or loss.(iii) Measuring expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
Measuring method of expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is equal to the method of financial 
assets at amortized cost, except for changes in loss allowances that are recognized as other comprehensive income. Amounts recognized in other 
comprehensive income for sale or repayment of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.(8) Derivative financial instruments including hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value upon agreement of the contract and re-estimated at fair value subsequently. The 
recognition of profit or loss due to changes in fair value of derivative instruments is as stated below:(i) Hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are accounted differently depending on whether hedge accounting is applied, and therefore, are classified into 
trading purpose derivatives and hedging purpose derivatives.Upon the transaction of hedging purpose derivatives, two different types of hedge accounting are applied; a fair value hedge, and a cash flow hedge.  
A fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, or an 
identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss. A cash flow hedge 
is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that (i) is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability (such as all 
or some future interest payments on variable rate debt) or a highly probable forecast transaction and (ii) could affect profit or loss.At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, 
including the nature of the risk, the objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, and the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of 
the hedging relationship.Fair value hedge
For designated and qualifying fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of a hedging derivative is recognised in profit or loss in the statement of 
comprehensive income. Meanwhile, the change in the fair value of the hedged item, attributable to the risk hedged, is recorded as part of the carrying 
value of the hedged item and is also recognised in profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. When the hedge no longer meets the criteria 
for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship is terminated. For hedged item recorded at amortized cost, the difference between the carrying value of 
the hedged item on termination and the face value is amortized over the remaining term of the original hedge using the EIR.Cash flow hedge
For designated and qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of gain or loss on the hedging instruments is initially recognised directly in 
equity. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. 
When the hedged cash flow affects the profit or loss in statement of comprehensive income, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded 
in the corresponding income or expense line in profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. When a hedge no longer meets the criteria 
for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged forecasted 
transaction is ultimately recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 
cumulative gain and loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income.Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
The Group designates non-derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments for foreign currency risk arising from net investments in foreign 
operations and recognises the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge in other comprehensive 
income. The cumulative amounts recognised in other comprehensive income relating to both the foreign exchange differences arising on translation of 
the results and financial position of the foreign operation and the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge of 
the net investment are reclassed from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment when the Group disposes of the foreign operation.(ii) Trading purpose derivatives
For trading purpose derivatives transaction, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in net income.090091(9) Day one profit or loss recognition
For financial instruments classified as level 3 on the fair value level hierarchy measured using assess variables not observable in the market, the 
difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price, which is equivalent to Day one profit or loss, is amortized by using 
the straight-line method over time.(10) Property and equipment
The Group’s property and equipment is recognized at the carrying amount as historical costs less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
in value. Historical costs include the expenditures directly related to the acquisition of assets.Subsequent costs are recognized in the carrying amount of assets or, if appropriate, as separate assets if the probabilities future economic benefits 
associated with the assets will flow into the Group and the costs can be measured reliably; the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. 
Furthermore, any other repairs or maintenances are charged to profit or loss as incurred.Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method to the amount of residual value less acquisition 
cost over the following estimated useful lives:TypeBuildings
StructureLeasehold improvementsVehicles
EquipmentOther propertiesUseful lives (years)12 ~ 60
10 ~ 514
44 ~ 8
2 ~ 40Property and equipment are impaired when its carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The Group assesses residual value and economic 
life of its assets at each reporting date and adjusts its useful life when necessary. Any gain or loss arising from the disposal of the asset (calculated 
as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is recognized in non-operating income (expense) in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income.(11) Investment property
The Group classifies property held for the purpose of rental income or benefits from capital appreciation as investment property. Investment 
property is measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the cost model is applied. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, an item of investment property is carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss.Investment properties are derecognized either when they have been disposed of or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from 
use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in the period of de-recognition. Reclassification to or from other account is made if 
there is a change in use of corresponding investment property.Depreciation of investment property is calculated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives as follows:TypeBuildings
StructureUseful lives (years)20 ~ 50
10 ~ 40(12) Intangible assets
An intangible asset is recognized only when its cost can be measured reliably, and the probabilities future economic benefits from the asset will flow 
into the Group are high. Separately acquired intangible assets are recognized at the acquisition cost, and subsequently, the cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment is recognized as the carrying amount.Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the 4-year to 30-year period of useful economic lives using the straight line method. At the end 
of each reporting period, the Group reviews intangible assets for any evidence that indicate impairment, and upon the presence of such evidence, 
the Group estimates the amount recoverable and recognizes the loss accordingly. Intangible assets are derecognized either when they have been 
disposed of or when the intangible assets are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal.Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually. Furthermore, the Group reviews such intangible 
assets to determine whether it is appropriate to consider these assets to have indefinite useful lives. If in the case the Group concludes an asset is 
not qualified to be classified as non-finite, prospective measures are taken to consider such an asset as finite.Expenditures on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, are recognized 
in profit or loss as incurred. Development expenditures are capitalized only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process 
is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete 
development and to use or sell the asset. Other development expenditures are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.(13) Leases(i) Lessee accounting
The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make 
lease payments at the commencement date of the lease. The Group elected not to apply the requirements to the short-term leases and low value assets.Right-of-use asset
The right-of-use asset is measured at its cost less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss with adjustments 
reflected arising from remeasurements of the lease liability. The cost of the right-of-use asset comprise the amount of the initial measurement of 
the lease liability, any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease 
incentive received. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis from the 
commencement date of the lease.Lease liabilities
At the commencement date, the lease liability is measured at present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. Lease payments include 
fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, 
amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain 
to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the 
lease. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as an expense in the period in which the event or condition 
that triggers those payments occurs.When measuring the present value, the lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If such implicit rate cannot be 
readily determined, the Group uses the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the amount of interest 
expenses recognized on the lease liability and reduced by the lease payments made.Lease liabilities are remeasured when the future lease payments are changed due to the following:
- Changes in an index or a rate;
- Changes in amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;
- Changes in the assessment of whether a purchase option or an option to renew is reasonably certain to be exercised; or
- Changes in the assessment of whether it is reasonably certain that an option to terminate the lease will not be exercised.Leases of low-value assets and short-term leases
The Group applies the recognition exemption for leases of low-value assets (e.g., office supplies and IT equipment) and short-term leases (i.e., leases 
with a lease term of 12 months or less). In these cases, lease payments are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of lease.(ii) Lessor accounting
The classification of leases is based on the extent to which risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased asset lie with the lessor.Finance lease
Leases of assets where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases, and the Group presents 
them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Also, initial direct cost that includes directly and additionally incurred 
commission fee, legal expenses, and internal accrued costs are included in finance lease receivables. The Group accounts for lease payment by 
apportioning into finance lease receivables and interest revenue, and interest revenue is recognized using the EIR method on uncollected finance 
lease net investment.Operating lease
A lease is classified as operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership, and the related asset 
is presented as acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation. Moreover, the minimum lease payment excluding guaranteed residual value is 
recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred by lessors in negotiating and arranging an operating 
lease shall be added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized as an expense over the lease term, and the depreciation policy for 
depreciable leased assets shall be consistent with the lessors’ normal depreciation policy for similar assets.092093(14) Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group tests for any evidence of impairment in assets and reviews whether the impairment has taken place by estimating the recoverable 
amount, at the end of each reporting period. The Group estimates the recoverable amount of each asset or a whole cash-generating unit unless 
it is possible to estimate the amount of the asset in that unit. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost and value in use, of 
an asset. The Group recognizes the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount of the asset as an impairment loss if the 
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business is allocated to each cash-generating unit that is expected to gain the benefits of the synergy 
effect. Impairment on cash-generating unit deducts other assets in proportion to their carrying amounts after deducting the carrying amount of 
goodwill allocated in that unit. Impairment loss on goodwill cannot be reversed once it is recognized.Except for impairment losses in respect of goodwill that are never reversed, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable 
amount, nor exceeds the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the 
asset in prior years.(15) Assets held for sale
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use, are classified as 
held for sale. In order to be classified as held for sale, the asset (or disposal groups) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and 
its sale must be highly probable. The assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying 
amount and fair value less cost to sell.The Group recognizes an impairment loss for any initial or subsequent write-down of an asset (or disposal groups) to fair value less costs to sell, and a 
gain for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell, up to the cumulative impairment loss previously recognized.Non-current assets that are classified as held for sale or part of a disposal group classified as held for sale are not depreciated (or amortized).(16) Non-derivative financial liabilities
The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities in 
accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of financial liability. The Group recognizes these financial liabilities 
in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial liability.(i) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in the current year include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated 
at FVTPL upon initial recognition. Financial liabilities and derivatives are classified as financial instruments held for trading if they are acquired for the 
purpose of repurchasing in the near future. Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at FVTPL upon initial recognition, if the profit or loss 
from the liabilities indicates to be more purpose-appropriate to be recognized as profit or loss. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are designated at fair value 
in subsequent measurements, and any related un-realized profit or loss is recognized as profit or loss.(ii) Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are recognized at fair value less cost less transaction cost upon initial recognition, and subsequently 
at amortized costs. The difference between the proceeds (net of transaction cost) and the redemption value is recognized in the statement of 
comprehensive income over the periods of the liabilities using the EIR.Fees paid on the establishment of a loan facility are recognized as transaction costs of the loan, if the probability that some or all of the facility will 
be drawn down is high. The amount is deferred until the financial liability would be withdrawn. If, however, there is not enough evidence to conclude 
a draw-down of some or all of the facility will occur, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortized over the period of the 
facility to which it relates.(iii) De-recognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is de-recognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability 
is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such 
an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the 
carrying value of the original financial liability and the consideration paid is recognized in profit or loss.(17) Employee benefits(i) Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits are employee benefits that are due to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the reporting period in which 
the employees render the related service. When an employee has rendered service to the Group during an accounting period, the Group recognizes 
the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service.(ii) Retirement benefits: defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund.The Group is no longer responsible for any foreseeable future liability after a certain amount or percentage of money is set aside for defined 
contribution plans. If the pension plan allows for early retirement, payments are recognized as employee benefits. If the contribution already paid 
exceeds the contribution due for service before the end of the reporting period, the Group recognizes that excess as an asset to the extent that the 
prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.(iii) Retirement benefits: defined benefit plans
The Group classifies all the pensions as defined benefit plans except defined contribution plans. The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined 
benefit plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that 
amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary 
using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash 
outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and have terms to 
maturity similar to the terms of the related pension liability.Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liabilities (assets), which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding 
interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income.(18) Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.(19) Financial guarantees
Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer (the Group) to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it 
incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the original or changed terms of a debt instrument. Financial 
guarantees are initially recognized in the financial statements at fair value on the date the guarantee was given.Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group’s liabilities under such guarantees are measured at the higher of:
- The amount determined in accordance with K-IFRS 1109 ‘Financial Instruments’ and 
-  The initial amount recognized, less, when appropriate, cumulative amortization recognized in accordance with K-IFRS 1115 ‘Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers’.(20) Securities under resale or repurchase agreements
Securities purchased under agreements to resell are recorded as other loans and receivables and the related interest from these securities is 
recorded as interest income; Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are recorded as borrowings, and the related interest from these 
securities is recorded as interest expense.(21) Policy reserves for insurance contracts
In accordance with the Insurance Business Act and related insurance standards, the Group is required to maintain policy reserves, which consist of 
premium reserve, unearned premium reserve, reserve for outstanding claims, reserve for participating policyholders’ dividends, excess participating 
policyholders’ dividend reserve and reserve for loss on participating insurance policies, as a liability which is measured in accordance with the Manual 
for Calculation of Premium and Policy Reserves as approved by the Financial Supervisory Commission. Details are as follows:(i) Premium reserve
Premium reserve represents an amount calculated based on a net premium valuation, which is the greater of an amount calculated by using the 
standard interest rate and standard risk rate issued by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), and an amount calculated using an internally 
generated rate derived by the Group. If the reserve is at zero or less, the amount is to be recorded at nil.094095(ii) Unearned premium reserve
Unearned premium reserve represents an amount allocated for certain premiums whose initial payment date falls within the current reporting period 
and future payments, if any, fall subsequent to the end of the reporting period.(iii) Guaranteed benefit reserve
Guaranteed benefit reserve guarantees a certain level of the insurance claims considering expected loss in the future. The Group’s guaranteed benefit 
reserve consists of the following:
-  Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit: reserves that guarantee financial resources for the pension benefit amount that equals to the 
predetermined value in the contract. 
- Guaranteed minimum death benefit: reserves that guarantee death benefit amount that equals to the predetermined value in the contract. 
-  Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit: reserves that guarantee the interim withdrawals amount that equals to the predetermined value in the 
contract during the period for interim withdrawals. 
-  Guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit: reserves that guarantee the interim withdrawals amount that equals to the predetermined value in the contract 
during lifetime. 
-  Other guaranteed benefits: guaranteed benefit reserves other than those listed above for a guarantee of insurance proceeds in excess of a certain level.(iv) Reserve for outstanding claims
Reserve for outstanding claims represents a reserve based on estimate of loss for insured events that have occurred prior to the reporting date but 
have not yet been settled or determined, including:
-  Outstanding losses: losses that have been reported to the insurer but are still in the process of settlement (in cases where a claim is partially paid, the 
remnant is reported). 
-  Incurred but not reported (IBNR): an estimate of the amount based on historical information of an insurer’s liability for claim-generating events that 
have taken place but have not yet been reported to the insurer. 
-  Reserve for lapsed insurance contracts: reserve for insurance cancellation refund for lapsed insurance contracts due to non-payment of insurance 
premium that still can be revived or deferred within a certain period. 
-  Outstanding claims: legitimate claims, such as compensation, refund, dividend that an insurer has not yet paid to policy holder.(v) Reserve for participating policyholders’ dividends
The reserve for participating policyholders’ dividends is classified into interest dividend reserve, mortality dividend reserve, interest rate difference 
guarantee reserve and long-term duration dividend reserve.(vi) Excess participating policyholders’ dividend reserve
Pursuant to relevant laws and contracts, the Group may provide an excess participating policyholder dividend reserve based on the operating results of 
related insurance products. The reserve may be used to pay participating policyholder dividends or additional dividends.(22) Equity
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares and share options are recognized 
as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.When the Group repurchases its share capital, the amount of the consideration paid is recognized as a deduction from equity and classified as 
treasury shares. The profits or loss from the purchase, disposal, reissue, or retirement of treasury shares are not recognized as current profit or loss. 
If the Group acquires and retains treasury shares, the consideration paid or received is directly recognized in equity.Non–controlling interests refer to equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Non- controlling interests consist of the 
minority interest net income calculated under K-IFRS 1103 ‘Business Combinations’ at the date of the initial combination, and minority interest of 
changes in equity after the business combination.(23) Government subsidy
Government subsidy without repayment obligation, which is used for the acquisition of certain assets, is accounted for as a deduction from the 
acquisition cost of the acquired assets. Such subsidy amount is offset against the depreciation or amortization of the acquired assets during such 
assets’ useful life.(24) Interest income and expense
Interest income and expense are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The effective interest method measures the 
amortized costs of financial instruments and allocates the interest income or expense during the related period.Upon the calculation of the effective interest rate, the Group estimates future cash flows by taking into consideration all contractual terms of the 
financial instrument, but not future credit loss. The calculation also reflects any fees or points paid or received, transaction costs and any related 
premiums or discounts. In the case that the cash flow and expected duration of a financial instrument cannot be estimated reliably, the effective 
interest rate is calculated by the contractual cash flow during the contract period.Once an impairment loss has been recognized on a financial asset or a group of similar assets, subsequent interest income is recognized on the 
interest rate that was used to discount future cash flow for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.(25) Fees and commission income
Fees and commission income and expense are classified as follows according to related regulations:(i) Fees and commission from financial instruments
Fees and commission income and expense that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset or liability are included in the 
measurement of the effective interest rate. It includes those related to evaluation of the borrowers’ financial status, guarantee, collateral, other 
agreements and related evaluation as well as business transaction, rewards for activities, such as document preparation and recording and setup 
fees incurred during issuance of financial liabilities. However, when financial instruments are classified as financial instruments at fair value through 
profit or loss, fees and commission are recognized as revenue upon initial recognition.(ii) Fees and commission from services
Fees and commission income charged in exchange for services to be performed during a certain period of time such as asset management fees, 
consignment fees and assurance service fees are recognized as the related services are performed. When a loan commitment is not expected to 
result in the draw-down of a loan and K-IFRS 1109 ‘Financial Instrument’ is not applied for the commitment, the related loan commitment fees are 
recognized as revenue proportionally to time over the commitment period.(iii) Fees and commission from significant transaction
Fees and commission from significant transactions, such as trading stocks and other securities, negotiation and mediation activities for third parties, 
for instance business transfer and takeover, are recognized when transactions are completed.(26) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognized upon the establishment of the Group’s right to receive the payment.(27) Income tax expense
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. Current income tax and deferred income tax are recognized in profit or loss except 
to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event, which is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, or a business 
combination.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the reporting period when the assets are 
realized or the liabilities settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting 
period. The measurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflects the income tax effects that would follow from the manner in which the 
Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.Subsidiaries calculate income tax based on their tax laws and report the amount as current income tax liability.The Group recognizes deferred income tax liabilities for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates, 
and interests in joint ventures, except to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The Group recognizes deferred income tax assets for all deductible 
temporary differences arising from investments in associates, to the extent that it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the 
foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized.The carrying amount of a deferred income tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred income tax asset to be utilized.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only if the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset the related current income tax assets 
and liabilities, and the assets and liabilities relate to income tax levied by the same tax authority and are intended to be settled on a net basis.096(In millions of won)(28) Accounting for trust accounts
The Group, for the purpose of financial reporting, differentiates trust assets from identifiable assets according to the Financial Investment Services 
and Capital Markets Act. Furthermore, the Group receives trust fees from the application, management and disposal of trust assets, and appropriates 
such amounts for fees from trust accounts.Meanwhile, in the case the fee from an unspecified principal or interests guaranteed money in trust does not meet the principal or interest amount, 
even after appropriating deficit with trust fees and special reserve, the Group fills in the remaining deficit in the trust account and appropriates such 
amounts for losses on trust accounts.(29) Regulatory reserve for credit losses
When the total sum of allowance for possible credit losses under K-IFRS is lower than the amount prescribed in Article 29(1) of the Regulations on 
supervision of Banking Business, the Group records the difference as a regulatory reserve for credit losses at the end of each reporting period.In the case that the existing regulatory reserve for credit losses exceeds the amount needed to be set aside at the reporting date, the surplus may be 
reversed. Furthermore, in the case that undisposed deficit exists, a regulatory reserve for credit losses is saved from the time the undisposed deficit 
is disposed.(30) Earnings per share
The Group represents its diluted and basic earnings per common share in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Basic earnings per 
share is calculated by dividing net profit attributable to shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting net profit attributable to common shareholders of the Group, 
considering dilution effects from all potential common shares, and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.(31) Correction of errors
Prior period errors shall be corrected by retrospective restatement in the first set of financial statements authorised for issue after their discovery 
except to the extent that it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the error.4.  Cash and Due from Banks(1) Cash and due from banks as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:Cash

4,82110. Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Group’s derivative financial instruments consist of trading derivatives and hedging derivatives, depending on the nature of each transaction. The 
Group enters into hedging derivative transactions mainly for the purpose of hedging risk related to changes in fair values of the underlying assets and 
liabilities and future cash flows.The Group enters into trading derivative transactions such as futures, forwards, swaps and options for arbitrage transactions by speculating on the 
future value of the underlying asset. Trading derivative transactions include contracts with the Group’s clients and its liquidation position.For the purpose of hedging the exposure to the variability of fair values and future cash flows of funds in Korean won by changes in interest rate, the 
Group mainly uses interest swaps or currency swaps. The main counterparties are foreign financial institutions and local banks. In addition, to hedge 
the exposure to the variability of fair values of bonds in foreign currencies by changes in interest rate or foreign exchange rate, the Group mainly uses 
interest swaps or currency swaps.The Group applies net investment hedge accounting by designating non-derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments and any gain or loss 
on the hedging instruments relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign 
currency translation reserve.Gains and losses on the hedging instrument accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal or 
partial disposal of the foreign operation.105(1)  The notional amounts outstanding for derivative contracts and the carrying amounts of the derivative financial instruments as ofDecember 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:Trading purpose derivative financial instruments:

-  Cash and due from banks: Fair value of cash is considered equivalent to the carrying amount. In the case of due from banks on demand, which do not have a 
set maturity and can be realized instantly, the carrying amount is a close estimate of the fair value and is assumed so. In the case of other ordinary due from 
banks, the cash flow discount method is used to estimate the fair value.
-  Securities measured at amortized cost: The fair value of securities measured at amortized cost is computed by widely-accepted appraisal agencies upon 
request.
-  Loans measured at amortized cost: The fair value of loans measured at amortized cost is the expected future cash flows, reflecting premature redemption 
ratio, discounted by the market interest rate, adjusted by a spread sheet considering the probability of default. Exceptions to this method include loans with 
credit line facilities, loans with a maturity of three months or less left and impaired loans, which the Group assumes the carrying amount as the fair value. 
-  Deposits: The fair value of deposits is computed using the discounted cash flow method. However, for deposits, whose cash flows cannot be estimated 
reasonably, the Bank assumes the carrying amount as the fair value.
-  Borrowings: The fair value of industrial financial debentures is computed using the discounted cash flow method by the Bank’s Fair Value Evaluation System. 
However, for borrowings including call money whose contractual maturity is three months or less, the Bank assumes the carrying amount as the fair value.
-  Debentures: The fair value of industrial financial debentures is computed using the discounted cash flow method by the Bank’s Fair Value Evaluation System.
-  Other financial assets and liabilities: The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities is computed using the discounted cash flow method. However, in 
cases cash flow cannot be estimated reasonably, the Group assumes the carrying amount as the fair value.(ii) The fair value hierarchy of financial instruments disclosed by fair value as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:Financial assets:Cash and due from banks (*)

The Korean financial authorities have implemented Basel II since January 2008, and adopted the Standardized Approach and the Foundation Internal 
Ratings-Based Approach.In conformity with the implementation roadmap of Basel II, the Group obtained the approval to use the Foundation Internal Ratings-Based Approach on 
credit risk from the FSS in July 2008 and has applied the approach since late June 2008. The Group applies the Standardized Approach on market risks 
and operational risks.The Group completed the Basel III standard risk management system in preparation of the adoption of the Basel III regulations announced on December 1, 
2013. Starting from 2013 year-end, the BIS capital adequacy ratio has been measured in accordance to the Basel III regulations.Responding to the requirement of the financial authorities, the Group recognizes interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit bias risk and reputational risk as 
well as Pillar I risks (credit risk, market risk and operational risk). Since 2015, the Group has responded to Pillar II regulations including additional capital 
requirements based on comprehensive assessment on bank risk management level. Since the end of 2015, the Group has applied the uniform standards 
for the public announcement of financial business for Basel compliance.The Group completed revised standards such as capital requirements for banks’ investments in funds in 2017, capital requirements for securitization in 
2018, and the Standardised Approach for measuring counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR) in 2019.160(In millions of won)To comply with the amended regulation relating to risk-weighted assets under Basel III, which will be effective on January 2022, the Group has a plan to 
obtain the approval of its management, receive the consultation and establish the relevant systems at the beginning of 2020.(viii) Internal capital adequacy assessment process
Internal capital adequacy assessment process is defined as the process that the Group aggregates significant risks, calculates its internal capital, 
compares the internal capital with the available capital and assesses its internal capital adequacy.- Internal capital adequacy assessment
For the purpose of the internal capital adequacy assessment, the Group calculates its aggregated internal capital by evaluating all significant risks and 
available capital considering the quality and components of capital, and then assesses the internal capital adequacy by comparing the aggregated 
internal capital with the available capital. In addition, the Group conducts periodic stress tests more than once every six months to assess potential 
weakness in crisis situations and uses its results to assess the internal capital adequacy. The Group assumes the macroeconomic situation as four 
stages of ‘normal-aggravation-pessimistic-serious’ and is preparing countermeasures such as checking the adequacy of capital by each stage.- Goal setting of internal capital management
The Group sets up and manages an internal capital limit on an annual basis, through the approval of the Risk Management Committee, in order to 
maintain internal capital adequacy by managing internal capital (integrated risks) within the extent of available capital. 
The prior year’s internal capital, analysis of domestic and foreign environment changes in the current year, and the direction and size of operations 
are all reflected in the goal setting of internal capital management to calculate the integrated internal capital scale. Moreover, Bank for International 
Settlements(“BIS”) capital adequacy ratio and risk appetite are taken into consideration in the goal setting of internal capital management- Allocation of internal capital
The Group’s entire internal capital is allocated to each segment and department, according to the extent of possible risk faced and size of operations, 
after the Risk Management Committee’s deliberation and the board of directors’ approval. The allocated internal capital is monitored regularly 
and managed using various management methods. The results of monitoring and managing the allocated internal capital are reported to the Risk 
Management Committee. In case of any material changes in the Group’s business plan or risk operation strategy, the Group adjusts the allocations 
elastically.- Composition of internal capital
Internal capital comprises all the significant risks of the Group and is composed of quantifiable and non-quantifiable risks. Quantifiable risks are 
composed of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk and credit concentration risk, foreign currency settlement risk, and are risks 
measured quantitatively by applying reasonable methodology using objective data. Non-quantifiable risks are composed of strategy risk, reputation 
risk, residual risk on asset securitization and furthermore. Non-quantifiable risks are those risks that cannot be measured quantitatively because of lack 
of data or the absence of appropriate measuring methodologies.(2) Credit Risk(i) Concept
Credit risk can be defined as potential loss resulting from the refusal to perform obligations or default of counterparties. More generally, it is 
used to refer to the possibility of loss from engaged bonds that cannot be redeemed properly or from substitute payments.(ii) Approach to credit risk management
Summary of credit risk management
The Group regards credit risk as the most significant risk area in its business operations, and accordingly, closely monitors its credit risk exposure. The 
Group manages both credit risks at portfolio level and at individual credit level. At portfolio level, the Group reduces credit concentration and restructures 
the portfolio in such a way to maximize profitability considering the risk level. To avoid credit concentration on a particular sector, the Group manages 
credit limits by client, group, and industry. The Group also resets exposure management directives for each industry by conducting an industry credit 
evaluation twice a year.At the individual credit level, the relationship manager (RM), the credit officer (CO) and the Credit Review Committee manage each borrower’s credit risk.Post management and insolvent borrower management
The Group monitors the borrower’s credit rating from the date of the loan to the date of the final collection of debt consistently, and inspects the 
borrower’s status regularly and frequently in order to prevent the generation of new bad debts and to stabilize the number of debt recoveries.In addition, an early warning system is operated to spot borrowers that are highly likely to be insolvent. The early warning system provides financial 
information, financial transaction information, public information and market information of the borrower, and such information is used by the RM and the 
CO to monitor and manage changes in the borrower’s credit rating.161Under the early warning system, a borrower that is highly likely to be insolvent is classified as an early warning borrower or a precautionary borrower 
The Group sets up a specific and applicable stabilization plan for such a borrower considering the borrower’s characteristics. Furthermore, sub-standard 
borrowers are classified as insolvent borrowers, and are managed intensively by the Group, which takes legal proceedings, disposals or corporate 
turnaround measures if necessary.Classification of asset soundness and provision of allowance for loss
Classification of asset soundness is fulfilled by the analysis and assessment of credit risk. The classification is used in order to provision an appropriate 
allowance, prevent further occurrences of insolvent assets and promote the normalization of existing insolvent assets to enhance the stabilization of asset 
operations.Based on the Financial Supervisory Regulations of the Republic of Korea, the Group has established standards and guidelines on the classification of asset 
soundness, according to the Forward-Looking Criteria (FLC), which reflects not only the borrower’s past records of repayment but also their future debt 
repayment capability.In conformity with these standards, the Group classifies the soundness of its assets as “normal”, “precautionary”, “substandard”, “doubtful”, or “estimated 
loss” and differentiates the coverage ratio by the level of classification.Details of loans by credit rating as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:< Corporate >AAA ~ BBB1

-163(iii) Measurement methodology of credit risk
Pursuant to Basel II, the Group selects the measurement methodology of credit risk considering the complexity of measurement, measurement factors, 
estimating methods and others. Measurement approaches are divided into Standardized Approach and Internal Ratings-Based Approach.Standardized Approach (SA)
In the case of the Standardized Approach, the risk weights are applied according to the credit rating assessed by External Credit Assessment Institution 
(ECAI). Risk weights in each credit rating are as follows:Credit rating
AAA ∼ AA-
A+ ∼ A-BBB+ ∼ BBB-
BB+ ∼ BB-
B+ ∼ B-
Below B-

Ratings Co., Ltd. are designated as domestic ECAI.The Group applies the credit rating based on the corresponding loan and same borrower’s unsecured senior loans. In the case the borrower’s risk weight 
is higher than the unrated exposure’s risk weight (100%), the higher weight is applied. In the case the borrower has more than one rating, the higher 
weight of the two lowest weights (Second Best Criteria) is applied.Internal Ratings-Based Approach (IRB)
To use the Internal Ratings-Based Approach, a bank must be approved by the FSS and should also meet the requirement pre-set by the FSS.In relation to Basel II that has been adopted domestically as of January 2008, the Group gained approval from the FSS to use the Foundation Internal 
Ratings-Based Approach in July 2008. The Group has calculated credit risk-weighted assets using the approach since late June 2008.Measurement method of credit risk-weighted asset
The Group calculates credit risk-weighted assets of corporate exposures and asset securitization exposures using the Foundation Internal Ratings-
Based Approach as of December 31, 2019.The Standard Approach is applied to special finance, non-residents, non-banking financial institutions currently, and will be replaced by the Internal 
Ratings-Based Approach in the future.The Standardized Approach is applied to country exposures, public institution exposures and bank exposures permanently and applied to overseas 
subsidiary and the Bank’s branch pursuant to prior consultation with the FSS.<Approved measurement method>Measurement methodStandardized ApproachPermanent SASAFoundation Internal Ratings-Based Approach
Application of IRB by phaseExposure- Countries, public institutions and banks
-  Overseas subsidiaries and branches, other assets, retail, residential property, commercial 
real estate, overdue loans (limited in loans for households)
- Corporate, small and medium enterprises, asset securitization and equity
- Special lending, non-residence, non-bank financial institutionsThe mitigated effect of credit risks reflects the related policies which consider eligible collateral and guarantees. The Group calculates the credit risk-
weighted assets using the capital adequacy ratio.Upon the calculation of credit risk-weighted assets for derivatives, the Group takes into consideration the set-off effects of transactions under legally 
enforceable rights to set-off to calculate exposures.164(In millions of won)Credit rating model
The results of credit rating are presented as grades through an assessment of the debt repayment capacity that the principal and interest of debt 
securities or loans are redeemed while complying with contractual redemption schedule.Using the Group’s internal credit rating model, the Group classifies debtors’ credit rating into 14 grades (AAA~D). To distinguish the difference between 
credits in the same grade, the Group uses 20 stages as auxiliaries to 14 grades.The Group’s regular credit rating process is carried out once a year and in the case of the change of debtor’s credit condition, the credit rating is 
frequently adjusted as necessary to retain the adequacy of credit rating.The results of credit rating are applied to various areas such as discrimination of loan processes, loan limit, loan interest rate, post loan management 
standard process, credit risk measurement, and allowance for loan losses assessment.Credit rating process control structure
According to the Principle of Checks and Balances, the Group has established the credit rating process control structure by which the credit rating 
system operates appropriately.-  Independent assessment of credit rating: The Bank’s business segment (RM) and credit rating assessment segment (Credit Rating Officer) are 
independently operated.
- I ndependent control of credit rating system: The control of credit rating system including the development of credit rating model is independentlyimplemented by the Bank’s Risk Management Department.-  Independent verification of credit rating system: Credit rating system is independently verified by Risk Validation Team of the Financial Planning 
Department.
- Internal audit of credit rating process: Credit rating process is audited by the Bank’s internal audit department.
-  Role of the Board of Directors and the Bank’s management: Major issues relating to credit rating process are approved by the Board of Directors and 
are regularly monitored by the Bank’s top management.The Group reviews debt serviceability based on a credit analysis when handling loans. Depending on the results, credit loan preservation is adjusted as 
necessary using such methods as interest rate preservation due to credit risk.The Group evaluates the value of the collateral, performing ability and legal validity of the guarantee at the initial acquisition. The Group re-evaluates the 
provided collateral and guarantees regularly for them to be reasonably preserved.For guarantees, the Group demands a corresponding written guarantee according to loan handling standards and the guarantor’s credit rating is 
independently calculated when in conformance with the credit rating endowment method.The quantification of the extent to which collateral and other credit enhancements mitigate credit risk of impaired financial assets as of December 31, 
2019 and 2018 are as follows:Securities measured at FVTPL

20168(In millions of won)(3) Capital management activities(i) Capital adequacy
The FSS approved the Group’s use of the Foundation Internal Ratings-Based Approach in July 2008. The Group has been using the same approach when 
calculating credit risk-weighted assets since the end of June 2008. The equity capital ratio and equity capital according to the standards of the Bank for 
International Settlements are calculated for the purpose of such disclosure. The equity capital ratio and equity capital are calculated on a consolidated 
basis. In conformity with the Banking Act, which is based on the implementation of Basel III on December 2013, the regulatory capital is divided into the 
following two categories.Tier 1 capital (Common Equity Tier 1 + Additional Tier 1 capital)
-  Common Equity Tier 1
Regulatory capital that represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the Group, takes the first and proportionately greatest share of any 
losses as they occur, and which principal is never repaid outside of liquidation meets the criteria for classification as common equity, including capital 
stock, capital surplus, retained earnings, qualifying non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, and accumulated other comprehensive income as common 
equity Tier 1.-  Additional Tier 1 capital
Capital stock and capital surplus related to issuance of capital securities that are subordinated, have non-cumulative and conditional dividends or

Market risk is defined as the possibility of potential loss on a trading position resulting from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and 
the price of stocks and derivatives. Trading position is exposed to risks, such as interest rate, stock price, and foreign exchange rate, etc. Non-trading 
position is mostly exposed to interest rates. Accordingly, the Group classifies market risks into those exposed from trading position or those exposed 
from non-trading position.(ii) Market risks of trading positions
Management method on market risks arising from trading positions
Trading position includes securities, foreign exchange position, and derivatives which are traded for short-term profits.Market risk is managed using VaR limit and loss limit. VaR limit is calculated in the view of entire Group and the calculated VaR limit is distributed into each 
department and each type (stock price, interest rate, foreign exchange rate and option). The trading department regulates and operates terms of stop loss 
and investment limits.Using the Standardized Approach and internal model of VaR, the Group’s VaR is measured daily and the measured VaR is used for risk monitoring and limit 
management. In the estimation of VaR, the historical simulation and two other supplemental procedures are used: variance-covariance matrix and Monte 
Carlo simulation. Through the stress test and back test, the estimation of VaR is validated daily.In estimating market risk, the Standardized Approach and the internal model are used. The Standardized Approach is used in order to calculate the required 
capital from market risk and the internal model is used in order to manage risks internally.Since July 2007, the Group has measured one-day VaR through the historical simulation method using the time series data of past 250 days under a 99% 
confidence level. The calculated VaR is monitored on a daily basis.The Group sets total limit of market risk based on annual business plan, risk appetite and others and monitors VaR limit of each department on a daily basis.170(In millions of won)171Market risk required equity

Management method on market risks arising from non-trading positions
The most critical market risk that arises in non-trading position is the interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is defined as the likely loss resulting from 
the unfavorable fluctuation of interest rate in the Group’s financial condition and is measured by interest rate VaR and interest rate EaR.Interest rate VaR is the maximum amount of decrease in net asset value resulting from the unfavorable fluctuation of interest rate. Interest rate EaR 
is the maximum amount of decrease in net interest income resulting from the unfavorable fluctuation of interest rate for a year.The Group’s interest rate VaR and interest rate EaR are measured through the simulation of conclusive interest rate scenario and are monthly 
reported to the Risk Management Committee. The Management’s target of interest rate VaR and interest rate EaR are approved at the beginning of 
the year. To disclose the Group’s interest risk, interest rate VaR and interest rate EaR are disclosed calculating change in economic value of equity 
(“△EVE”) and in net interest income (“△NII”) based on the application of IRRBB (“Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book”) method.△EVE and △NII of the Group’s non-trading positions as of December 31, 2019 are as follows:△EVE

3,998,596172(In millions of won)(5) Liquidity risk management(i) Concept
Liquidity risk is defined as the possibility of potential loss due to a temporary shortage in funds caused by a maturity mismatch or an unexpected 
capital outlay. Liquidity risk soars when funding rates rise, assets are sold below a normal price, or a good investment opportunity is missed.(ii) Approach to liquidity risk management
The Group manages its liquidity risks as follows:Allowable limit for liquidity risk
• The allowable limit for liquidity risk sets LCR, NSFR and  Mid- to long-term foreign currency fund management ratio 
•  The management standards with regards to the allowable limit for liquidity risk should be set using separate and stringent set ratios in accordancewith the FSS guidelines.<Measurement Methodology>
• LCR: (High quality liquid assets / Total net cash outflows over the next 30 calendar days) X 100
• NSFR: Available Stable Funding / Required Stable Funding X 100
•  Mid- to long-term foreign currency fund management ratio: Foreign currency funding being repaid after 1 year / Foreign currency lending beingcollected after 1 year X 100Early warning indicator
In order to identify prematurely and cope with worsening liquidity risk trends, the Group has set up 17 indexes such as the “Foreign Exchange 
Stabilization Bond CDS Premium,” and measures the trend monthly, weekly and daily as a means for establishing the allowable liquidity risk limit 
complementary measures.Stress-Test analysis and contingency plan
•  The Group evaluates the effects on the liquidity risk and identifies the inherent flaws. In the case where an unpredictable and significant liquidity 
crisis occurs, the Group executes risk situation analysis quarterly based on crisis specific to the Group, market risk and complex emergency, and 
reports to the Risk Management Committee for the purpose of the Group’s solvency securitization.• The Group established detailed contingency plan to manage the liquidity risks at every risk situations.(iii) Analysis on remaining contractual maturity of financial instruments
