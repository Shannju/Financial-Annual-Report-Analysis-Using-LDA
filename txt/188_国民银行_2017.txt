made a concerted 
effort to amplify 
Group-wide synergies 
and secure future 
growth engines 
in 2017.INTRODUCTIONOPERATION REVIEWFINANCIAL SECTIONAPPENDIX007Dear respected shareholdersI would like to extend my sincere appreciation to our 
shareholders for your unwavering support and en-
couragement for KB Financial Group throughout the  
last year.Fueled by the growth in advanced economies in 2017, 
the external economy laid the turning point of escap-
ing from the slowing trajectory. The domestic economy 
also recovered a much-anticipated growth momentum. 
KB Financial Group sought to amplify Group-wide syn-
ergies while securing future growth engines amid such 
economic environment.We fully privatized our two non-banking companies, KB 
Insurance and KB Capital, into the wholly-owned sub-
sidiaries of KB Financial Group, adding to Group-wide 
synergies. Also, we expanded our global presence by 
diversifying business portfolio including: launching KB 
KOLAO Leasing Co., Ltd. in Laos; launching KB Micro-
finance Myanmar Co., Ltd.; opening Tuek Thla branch 
office in Cambodia; and acquiring Maritime Securities 
Incorporation in Vietnam.Moreover, we have been phasing in “Digital KB” by in-
troducing “KB Liiv ON,” a new app that combines KB 
Kookmin Bank’s real estate information service with its 
mortgage products, interactive banking platform “Liiv 
Talk Talk,” “palm vein authentication service,” and “video 
ARS service.”Here is a brief summary of our business performance 
last year.KB Financial Group posted KRW 3.3 trillion in net profit, 
up by KRW 1.2 trillion from the previous year, a feat at-
tributable to the improved net interest margins amid in-
terest rate rise and robust loan growth, revenue growth 
in the non-interest sectors from economic recovery, 
enhanced cost efficiency and asset quality, and earn-
ings contribution from fully consolidated KB insurance 
and KB capital into the Group.Total assets also jumped to KRW 436.79 trillion, up by 
KRW 61.1 trillion from 2016, due mainly to the full con-
solidation of KB Insurance, solid loan growth, and en-
hanced asset quality.I have every conviction that these remarkable achieve-
ments both in profitability and assets growth were 
attributable to our shareholders’ steadfast trust, con-
tinued support from customers, and dedication of the 
employees. We will continue to focus on change and 
innovation to become an ever-growing financial group 
in this fast-changing business environment.It  is  anticipated  that  the  economy  at  home  and 
abroad will post gradual recovery this year out of 
prolonged low growth. However, uncertainties sur-
rounding the global financial environment will likely 
continue given the growing household debt issue 
caused by interest rate increase, concerns over mar-
ginal borrowers, and flow in and out of global capital.008KB FINANCIAL GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017We will rise to challenges and secure differentiated competitive edge by 
putting together knowledge and taking systematic measures, thereby 
establishing a solid position as the leading financial group and promoting 
sustainable growth driven by innovation.As we strive to overcome those challenges and turn 
crisis into opportunity, KB Financial Group will con-
centrate all our resources available on achieving the 
initiative of “establishing a solid position as the lead-
ing financial group and promoting sustainable growth 
driven by innovation” by realizing the following goals:First, we will fortify the Group’s business 
portfolio and discover new growth engines.
We will further fortify business portfolio by strength-
ening the key competitiveness of subsidiaries and 
ensuring organic collaboration among business divi-
sions. Furthermore, we promise to establish ourselves 
as the “First Mover” in digital finance by internalizing 
new technologies and securing competitive edges in 
the field of customer-friendly digitalization. For glob-
al business division, we will expand market presence 
in Southeast Asia through localized financial models. 
The “Bold Move” strategy toward advanced econo-
mies will be promoted depending on conditions.Second, we will revamp all our services and 
processes in a customer-centric way.
We will expand customized products and services 
lineup by strengthening data analysis organizations 
and identifying customers’ needs more quickly and 
precisely. We also pledge to continue to innovate our 
businesses by accelerating “One-stop service” that 
combines business areas of subsidiaries, thus se-
curing differentiated competitiveness recognized by 
customers.Third, we will nurture “world-class” talents 
while establishing pioneering and creative 
corporate culture.
For the purpose of enhancing competence espe-
cially in the fields of wealth management, corporate 
investment banking, capital market, and human re-
sources and cultivating expertise in future core digital 
finance businesses, we will continue to strengthen HR 
programs at the Group level by making use of newly 
opened “Group HRD Center.”Furthermore, we will continue to nurture core talents 
with enterprising and creative spirit who can leadINTRODUCTIONOPERATION REVIEWFINANCIAL SECTIONAPPENDIX009the financial business by promoting human resources

this year and wish shareholders and your families 
good health and all the very best. Thank you.Jong Kyoo YoonChairman and CEO 
KB Financial Group Inc.Lastly, we promise to bring “results” through  
“fast execution.”
In a digital financial environment where survival is 
increasingly dependent upon how fast you move, the 
first and foremost principle should be the “swift deci-
sion and execution.” The diverse types of “Agile” or-
ganizations which are being promoted will lead us to 
become a financial group where swift decision-mak-
ing and powerful execution are ensured.Fiercer competition is anticipated this year in an un-
certain business environment. We will have to come 
to grips with the paradigm shift in the financial in-
dustry, in particular, the emergence of Internet-only 
banks and global non-finance ICT businesses. How-

of subsidiaries and pursuing organic collaboration among business 
divisions to ensure robust business portfolio at the Group level. We 
are also committed to growing into the "First Mover" in the digital 
finance field by internalizing new technologies and securing cus-

system, thereby transforming ourselves into an action-oriented KB

Reinforcement of Global Competitiveness through M&A
In 2017, diverse types of financial companies in Singapore, Vietnam, 
and Myanmar joined KB Financial Group through M&As by subsidiar-
ies, through which we have discovered new business areas and se-
cured hubs for the expansion of global investment capability. These 
efforts and results will help us seek future growth engines in the 
world beyond the domestic market which have reached a plateau.KB Financial Group plans to expand its global business to improve 
business portfolio, while diversifying its revenue sources through ag-
gressive M&A in the non-banking sector.Stronger Group Business Portfolio
Launched in January 2017, KB Securities has become a core sub-
sidiary of the Group by securing competitiveness in each business 
sector and stably generating profits in early stage. The Group also 
succeeded in fully privatizing non-banking subsidiaries engaging in 
non-life insurance and capital, thereby securing stronger return on 
investment and revenue base.Establishment of a Dynamic Organization System
Our data analysis organization was expanded to boost supports for 
customer-oriented products and services through systematic data 
asset establishment and active data analysis. We also launched the 
Capital Market Division to nurture the capital market business as a 
major profit center by reinforcing competitiveness and collaboration 
among subsidiaries. New departments were added as well with the 
aim of further fulfilling corporate social responsibility, realizing a dy-
namic corporate culture, and upgrading Group-level talent training.Management Strategies to Achieve 
the Goals for 2018
Response to Changes in Business Environment
Although the global economy is expected to recover gradually in 
2018, uncertainties remain in the financial market due to critical is-
sues in terms of household debt, insolvency of marginal borrowers, 
and global capital movements caused by a rise of interest rate. The 
emergence of internet-only banks and offensive global ICT players 
bring about a paradigm shift in the financial market. In response to 
these changes, the Group will implement the following four strategies 
(RACE 2018).INTRODUCTIONOPERATION REVIEWFINANCIAL SECTIONAPPENDIX017R einforcement: solidifying Group business portfolio and

iaries and reinforce collaborative systems among their businesses,

Asian markets.C ustomer-centric: innovating all services and processes for 
customers
The core of "One Firm, One KB" is to provide customer-oriented 
services. In that sense, the Group is going to identify customer needs 
on a timely basis and continue to expand customized products and 
services. We will also strive to secure distinctive competitiveness 
recognized by customers by making one-stop service that combines 
businesses of subsidiaries a routine.A gile: becoming KB that bears fruits through swift execution

principle. We will also make execution-oriented KB with fast deci-
sion-making process by operating diverse types of agile organization 
units.E xcellence & Efficiency: cultivating world class talents and

Customer Loyalty Services
The KB Star Club system was upgraded for the first time since its 
implementation in February 2010. Through the upgrading pro-
cess, it raised points for life-friendly financial transactions (salary 
transfer, main transfer, etc.), which are counted for selection of 
excellent customers, ensuring that loyal customers can receive 
more benefits. What's more, Family Service for all Star Club cus-
tomers, MVP Service for MVP customers, and Maestro Service 
for multi-deal MVP customers were created to provide KB’s 
unique differentiated premium benefits to loyal customers.In particular, Maestro Service is a new service provided to cus-
tomers who are selected as MVP Stars by two or more subsid-
iaries in banking, securities, non-life insurance, card, and life 
insurance. Optional services such as annual hotel memberships 
and gift certificates worth KRW 100,000 ~ KRW 5,000,000 are 
provided, depending on the number of MVP Stars by subsidiary.Furthermore, it added new digital service routes such as Star 
Banking and KB Liiv Mate app to provide easy and convenient 
services to more customers. Customers may benefit from cou-
pon and Star Club rating programs as well. For better customer 
convenience, coupons can be issued from the nearest branch or 
each subsidiary's website.As a result of these efforts, KB Kookmin Bank topped the list in 
the National Customer Satisfaction Index (NCSI) survey for 11 
consecutive years for the first time in the banking sector.The number of KB Financial Group customers increased 562 
thousand from the previous year to 33,630 thousand on the 
back  of  improving  the  loyal  customer  benefit  system.  The 
number of cross-transaction customers among subsidiaries in-
creased 426 thousand to 9,516 thousand, greatly expanding its 
customer base.Launch of Packaged Financial Products and 
Service Process Improvement
In order to reflect changes in the financial market environment 
and various needs of financial customers, KB Financial Group 
strived to intensify relationship with customers and enhance KB 
Financial Group's One-Firm image by providing packaged finan-
cial products and improving service processes.Launch of Packaged Products
In March, we launched the "KB 1conomy Youth Package (sav-
ings/loans/card/insurance/fund/ELS),"which  integrated  the 
Group's product capabilities to offer customized financial solu-tions to the rapidly growing number of single-person house-
holds. The “1conomy” is a new word coined by combining "one 
person" with "economy" to indicate single-person households 
who tend to enjoy life alone. This first-ever packaged product 
targeting single-person households has recorded about 150,000 
new subscriptions by the end of December since its launch, re-
ceiving favorable response from customers.KB Financial Group also launched the KB petconomy Package 
product in July for the rapidly increasing number of pet owners. 
The “petconomy” is a word that combined "pet" with "economy." 
The KB petconomy Package is a specialized financial product 
for 5.9 million pet owners, consisting of discount cards that can 
be used in the pet-related industry and companion animal in-
jury insurance. The product attracted favorable feedback from 
pet-raising households.Improvement of Subsidiary-linked Processes
In February 2017, KB Financial Group completed the "integrated 
subsidiary loan product inquiry and application process" that pro-
vides customers whose application for credit loans were denied 
with one-stop service to inform credit loan limit and interest rate 
of loan products from four major subsidiaries including KB Insur-
ance and KB Capital and help them apply to appropriate loans. By 
the end of December 2017, it has contributed to receiving about 
1,510 loan applications and lending KRW 24.8 billion.The number of KB Financial Group customers in-
creased 562 thousand from the previous year to 
33,630 thousand on the back of improving the 
loyal customer benefit system33,629,883 personsINTRODUCTIONOPERATION REVIEWFINANCIAL SECTIONAPPENDIX021In  September,  the  Group  greatly  improved  customer  con-
venience by adding non-face-to-face services through Star 
Banking, a banking app, and unveiled "subsidiaries’ one-click 
loan products" through Liiv Mate, the Group-wide easy-to-
use banking platform. Through the platform, users are able to 
inquire interest rates and limits of the loans from KB Insurance, 
KB Kookmin Card, KB Capital, and KB Savings Bank at once and 
apply for the ones they prefer.To further enhance customer satisfaction in financial services 
going forward, KB Financial Group will continue to provide group 
package products and improve processes in collaboration with 
subsidiaries.Upgrade of the Integrated Service Channel
In order to build customer-centric business system, KB Financial 
Group established an integrated sales channel and endeavored 
to improve the profitability of retirement pensions by upgrading 
the outbound sakes channel operation models for non-life/
life insurance and standardizing and advancing the customer 
post-management system in 2017.In the aspect of upgrading the outbound sakes channel op-
eration models for non-life/life insurance, the insurance plan-
ners are now allowed to expect more income than before as 
cross-selling among card and non-life/life insurance sectors is 
available. With this structured enabled, KB has successfully built 
its own ecosystem of providing one-stop outbound financial 
products to customers.The standardization and advancement of post-management 
system for retirement pension customers made it possible to 
easily convert existing business system focused on DB-type 
pension program to DC and IRP based programs. It also helped 
improve the management of rate of return and asset rebal-
ancing for customers. This effort enabled us to unify the man-
agement system of both personal and retirement pensions and 
increase the rate of return for customers, laying a foundation for 
reorganization of our business lineup.Based on these achievements, KB will continue to expand the 
linked areas among subsidiaries' sales channels by embedding 
cross-selling models through outbound channels, enhancing 
cooperative systems for targeting institutional customers, and 
invigorating back-end support collaborations, thereby solidify-
ing the culture of "One-Firm, KB.”Total Solution for Corporate Customers
KB Financial Group has enhanced its one-stop service capability 
to handle various needs of corporate customers through the 
Co-RM program, a collaborative system between subsidiaries 
targeting SMEs. Core products and services of KB Kookmin 
Bank, KB Securities, KB Insurance, KB Kookmin Card, and KB 
Capital are suggested in an integrated manner through the Co-
RM program. By doing so, a total solution for different financial 
needs in businesses such as funding, operation, and risk man-
agement is provided.Moreover, with the aim of reinforcing competitiveness in cor-
porate banking, we promote collaborative marketing campaigns 
targeting corporate customers of all subsidiaries at the Group 
level, while expanding integrated marketing activities in alliance 
with excellent corporate customers such as Engineering Guar-
antee Insurance (EGI).The number of customers for 
cross-transaction among affiliates 
increased 426 thousand from the previous 
year to 9,516 thousand in 20179,516,322 persons“One-Firm, KB” is the slogan that 
commits to creating synergy among all 
subsidiaries and establishing a unique 
communication culture of the GroupOne-Firm, KB022KB FINANCIAL GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017Risk ManagementRisk Management System and  
Type-specific Risk Management
KB Financial Group's risk management system focuses on ef-
ficiently supporting the mid to long-term strategies and man-
agement decision-making processes of the Group. To that end, 
it pursues enhancing risk transparency of the Group, preventing 
risk transfer among subsidiaries, and making preemptive re-
sponses to the rapidly-changing financial environment.Risk Governance
The Risk Management Committee establishes risk manage-
ment strategies, determines the bearable risk appetite, reviews 
the Group's risk management status, and approves whether to 
apply the risk management system, methodologies, and major 
improvements. The Risk Management Council consists of the 
Risk Management Officers from the holding company and its 
subsidiaries. The Council deliberates matters delegated by the 
Risk Management Committee and discusses the details of the 
risk management. Risk Management Department of the holding 
company monitors and manages Group risk status and internal 
capital limits by establishing risk management policies and op-
erating relevant processes.Credit Risk Management
KB Financial Group defines credit risks as the expected/unex-
pected losses arising from default of the counterparty or declin-
ing creditworthiness.•  Credit Policy Direction: With the management strategies set, 
KB Financial Group establishes the credit policy in consid-
eration of economic outlook, business environment, asset 
soundness trends, and risk management capabilities, and then 
implements it in each business division such as households, 
businesses, and credit cards. The basic direction of the credit 
policy is to generate stable income and maximize the Group’s 
value by maintaining asset soundness and minimizing mid to 
long-term credit cost volatility.•  Credit Risk Measurement and Management: The company 
operates a credit risk measurement system that adopted cal-
culation standards of the Internal Ratings Based Approach. 
The bankruptcy of the borrowers, potential loss of exposure, 
remaining maturity, and correlation with the economy are 
reflected in the system to calculate the maximum amount of 
loss that can be incurred.•  Total Exposure Limit Management: The company operates the 
Total Exposure Limit Management System to prevent exces-
sive credit risk exposure and concentration of assets in spe-cific sectors and optimize credit portfolio through stable asset 
management. Risk Management Department in the holding 
company monitors and reports it to the Risk Management 
Committee on a periodical basis.Market Risk Management
KB Financial Group defines market risk as the risk of loss from 
trading positions mainly due to fluctuating market drivers such 
as interest rates, exchange rates and stock prices. It recognizes, 
measures, monitors, controls, and reports market risks inherent 
in bonds, foreign currencies, stocks, and derivatives. Market Val-
ue at Risk (VaR) is a quantification index to measure the risk in-
herent in a trading account; VaR indicates the maximum amount 
of loss that can be incurred in a portfolio over a period of time 
at a certain level of confidence. The Group verifies the adequa-
cy of the VaR model on a daily basis by comparing actual and 
virtual profit/loss with the VaR calculation results. In the case of 
assets or subsidiaries where Market VaR cannot be applied, we 
adopted the standard method of supervision at the group level 
to manage risk capital.Interest Rate Risk Management
Interest rate risk is defined as the risk of a decrease in the net 
asset value or net interest income (NII) caused by adverse fluc-
tuations in market interest rates. The goals of the interest rate 
risk management are to maximize net interest income within 
the acceptable risk range by managing assets and liabilities in 
a comprehensive manner and minimize the loss of net interest 
margin that can be caused by adverse interest rate fluctuations.Liquidity Risk Management
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk arising from inconsistency 
in the maturity of funds and failure to respond to unexpected 
demand/supply of funds. It manages liquidity risks in a systemic 
manner in order to secure liquidity for operation of funds such 
as loans and bonds, while meeting the demand for cash out-
flows such as deposit withdrawals, maturity of issued financial 
bonds and repayment of borrowings.Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is defined as any financial and non-financial 
risks that negatively affect the capital due to operating activ-
ities. The purpose of operational risk management is to meet 
regulatory objectives of the supervisory agency and to spread 
the risk management culture companywide through strength-
ened internal control and improved processes.INTRODUCTIONOPERATION REVIEWFINANCIAL SECTIONAPPENDIX023Internal Capital Management
Internal capital is the capital required to prevent economic in-
solvency due to unexpected losses under the target confidence 
level. KB Financial Group manages Group capital adequacy by 
measuring, allocating, and managing internal capital for eachsubsidiary by risk types. The Risk Management Committee de-
termines the risk appetite of the Group and allocates internal 
capital by type of risk and by subsidiary. Each subsidiary then 
operates businesses within the allocated capital.Emerging Risk Management
We define emerging risks as risks that are newly developing due to economic, environmental, and social changes and that 
have significant impacts on our business activities in the long term. We are continuously monitoring emerging risks and 
come up with preemptive measures to mitigate the risks. We have identified “demographic shift caused by low birth rate and 
population aging” and “changes in business activities driven by innovation of digital finance” as major emerging risks facing 
us. Description of the risks, long-term impact on business and our mitigating actions are explained in more detail below.Emerging RisksDemographic shift caused by low birth rate andpopulation agingChanges in business activities driven by theinnovation of digital financeDescriptionImpacts on 
BusinessMitigating 
ActivitiesThe demographic shift including aging population 
will cause decreases in savings rate and household 
income as elderly debtors come to stop engaging in 
economic activities, which could lead to deteriora-
tion of asset quality.The innovation of digital finance provides financial 
institutions with new growth opportunities, while 
lack of preparation for new technologies and finan-
cial innovation could deteriorate competitiveness. 
At the same time, new technologies and innovations 
could bring about risks to businesses in terms of in-
formation technology, information security, financial 
fraud, etc.The analysis of asset quality by age of debtors of 
household credit loan shows that asset quality dete-
riorates with age.The innovation of digital finance and new technol-
ogies are affecting entire value chain of traditional 
financial business and are fundamentally changing 
how we operate our business creating new business 
models, products, and services.It is expected that debtors in our loan portfolio are 
expected to reach age groups that are highly likely to 
experience decline in income, which could ultimately 
lead to deterioration of asset quality. In response, 
we are proactively enhancing our risk management 
process including upgrading our credit guideline 
considering debtors' income level by life cycle stage 
and their debt amount.To respond to new risks developing due to inno-
vation of digital finance and technologies, we are 
proactively analyzing and identifying potential risks 
and coming up with effective countermeasures. At 
the same time, we are taking full advantage of new 
technologies such as big data and machine learning 
to enhance risk management capabilities.024KB FINANCIAL GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017Risk ManagementStress Testing
Crisis situation analysis is conducted to analyze the potential vulner-
abilities of portfolios and establish countermeasures. For analysis, a 
scenario produced on the basis of the forecasted changes in eco-
nomic conditions is used. KB Financial Group analyzes how rapid-
ly-changing environment affects the Group and conducts a crisis sit-
uation analysis for the Group as a whole once a year. In such process, 
it takes into consideration business cycle and economic outlook to 
ensure preemptive response. The results of the analysis are reported 
to the management and Risk Management Committee, ensuring that 
they can be properly utilized when setting Group-level risk appetite/
limits and making decisions.Operating the Basel III Internal Ratings Based Approach for 
Group Credit Risk 
Keeping up with the introduction of the Basel III capital regulations by 
the Financial Services Commission (FSC), KB Financial Group decided 
to build up human and physical infrastructure and proactively re-
spond to changes in the regulatory environment. As a result, starting 
from December 2013, the Group's risk-weighted assets and capital 
adequacy ratio have been calculated in accordance with the Basel III 
criteria. Furthermore, KB Financial Group established a single-model 
management system of credit risk internal ratings based approach, 
which was approved by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), for 
the purpose of enhancing the risk management level of subsidiaries 
in the Group. It began to apply the management system from calcu-
lation of the Group BIS ratio at the end of 2016. Through operation 
of the Group credit risk internal ratings based approach, KB Financial 
Group has not only improved the Group’s capital adequacy but also 
advanced its risk management systems, including Group risk man-
agement methods, system building, data management and control 
structure. With a risk management culture settled, the Group expects 
to further upgrade Group-wide risk management level, international 
creditworthiness, and management soundness.Direction of Group Risk Management for 2018
As the US rate hike is expected to accelerate, the global financial 
market is likely to be increasingly volatile. Domestic risk factors such 
as household debt and changing real-estate market regulations are 
present as well. Considering that the potential risks inherent in the 
domestic and overseas economy can pose a threat to the soundness 
and profitability of financial institutions, risk management to minimize 
those risks is critical more than ever. Therefore, the company is set to 
strengthen monitoring and pre-risk management of its subsidiaries, 
especially those vulnerable to volatile market drivers such as interest 
rates, foreign exchange rates, and stock prices. By doing so, it will 
continue to secure the industry's highest level of asset soundness.The company will further enhance its risk management skills through 
preemptive responses and monitoring of its subsidiaries developing 
overseas markets and launching new businesses.Information Protection
KB Financial Group is making every effort to respond to the changing 
needs of customers who want a better protection of their infor-
mation as digitization of finance accelerates. Major activities and 
achievements in 2017 are as follows:•  KB Financial Group set the information protection standards by 
referring to the internal/external regulations and Information 
Security Management System (ISMS) criteria for each area of in-
formation protection such as network, server, DB, application, ter-
minal, encryption, external transmission, and public website. As a 
result, the Group is able to maintain the coherence of information 
protection control measures and policies, thereby improving the 
Group-wide level of information protection;•  By obtaining the ISO27001 certification, an international stan-
dard for information security management systems, KB Securities 
proved that it has a stable information security management sys-
tem in compliance with the international standards;•  We established a system for joint responses to Group issues, in-
cluding regulation of information protection, response to new 
technologies, and sharing customer information among subsidiar-
ies, by activating councils including "Group Information Protection 
Council";•  In order to raise awareness of information security among employ-
ees, the company has increased its support for information securi-
ty training and hosted a Group-wide Idea/UCC Contest to settle a 
culture of information protection;•  Meanwhile, in order to strengthen the security of partners, it held 
a Group joint seminar that covered a differentiated inspection plan 
according to the security levels of partners and included an ex-
ternal expert training course to enhance awareness of information 
protection;KB Financial Group intends to further upgrade the IT security and 
compliance status of its subsidiaries' electronic financial transaction 
programs. In line with the changing IT environment, the Group plans 
to make a paradigm shift in the information protection management 
system by taking a data-centered perspective, departing from con-
ventional system-centered perspective. What's more, the company 
will do its best to predict and prevent threat factors by supporting 
current active and diverse research activities in the Information Se-
curity Technology Lab, which began operating in 2017.INTRODUCTIONOPERATION REVIEWFINANCIAL SECTIONAPPENDIX025Digital FinancePerformances in 2017
Competition in the digital finance market has been getting fierc-
er due to the entrance of large ICT companies and emergence 
of Internet-only banks. To cope with this market change, KB 
Financial Group has intensified its industry-leading digital fi-
nance capability by developing customer life-friendly financial 
platforms, building infrastructure for technology innovation, and 
establishing an ecosystem for co-prosperity with FinTech com-
panies. Furthermore, we have expanded customer-tailored ser-
vices based on big data analysis and focused on nurturing data 
analysis professionals.Development of Customer Life-friendly Platforms
We launched “Liiv TalkTalk,” an interactive platform that con-
nects the Group's platforms and business domains, and “Liiv 
ON,” the first real estate trading platform in the domestic finan-
cial industry. In addition, our representative banking platform 
"Star Banking" became more customer-oriented by improving its 
UX/UI and the simple financial platform "Liiv" was upgraded."Liiv TalkTalk" enables financial transactions such as product 
inquiry, transfer, extension of loans by simply communicating 
with " TalkTalk," an artificial intelligence secretary, and provides 
a security-rich messenger service."Liiv ON" not only searches for houses in accordance with cus-
tomer requirements but also provides a wide range of contents 
based on its know-how in real estate market such as new-
ly-married couples' house, pre-sale news, and commercial su-
premacy information for small business owners, differentiating 
itself from other real estate platforms.Our representative banking platform "Star Banking" provides an 
intuitive interface and emotional design. Its new services include 
"account view" where users can view the balance in their ac-
counts without having to log in, and "fast transfer" that enables 
wire transfer within a matter of 5 seconds. The three core digital 
values -Simple, Easy, and Fast- are perfectly implemented in 
the service. Liiv, an easy-to-use financial platform, also offers 
a digitally-optimized banking environment by scaling down the 
signing-up procedure and advancing services.Infrastructure for Technology Innovation
We established the Group-wide joint open API platform to build 
an innovative technology infrastructure. Through the platform, 
108 APIs developed by 7 subsidiaries are being used for differ-
ent types of business. It has a registered patent on "P2P pay-
ment solution using mobile-phone sound wave" and a patent 
pending on "technology for separation of APP security moduleusing block chain technology" in an effort to secure its compet-
itive edge over other FinTech solution companies.Ecosystem for Co-prosperity with 
FinTech Companies
KB Financial Group has been establishing an ecosystem for 
co-prosperity with FinTech companies for the purpose of in-
ternalizing new technologies. As part of that, the KB Innovation 
HUB, the first FinTech startup support channel in the domestic 
financial industry, has been running since 2015. Through the 
KB Innovation Hub, we are focusing on securing leadership in 
the FinTech sector. Major activities include arranging businessWe launched "Liiv TalkTalk," an

ed, to attract more companies to the hub. Currently, new ser-
vices such as voice authentication and chatbot where start-up's 
technologies and KB's expertise are combined are going to be 
materialized.Customized Services Based on 
Big Data Analysis
In order to build an environment for targeted trend marketing 
and personalized marketing, we have formed a microsegment by 
analyzing customer information (basic and transaction informa-
tion, asset status, consumption pattern, location, etc.). This en-
ables us not only to improve the accuracy of marketing activities 
but also to detect changes in market trends that reflect financial 
needs of customers. Intuitiveness and usability of customer 
analysis were enhanced as well. Furthermore, it is possible to 
identify customer groups for diverse campaigns from the micro 
point of view that the headquarters and branch offices require, 
which will be applied to product development, discovery of 
niche customers, and recommendation of products & services 
tailored to each customer group.We built a Hadoop-based big data platform for an integrated 
storage, processing, and analysis of structured & unstructured

Solid Growth Momentum in CIB Business
The domestic financial market failed to post a ro-
bust recovery in 2017 due to uncertainties from

insurance products and their added functions to 
bolster product competitiveness.Field-First Business Culture
The field-first business culture was successfully 
established by systemizing the feedback process to 
field requirements, enhancing trainings by chan-
nel, and expanding automatic underwriting, which 
resulted not only in improving persistency rate and 
consultant retention rate but in invigorating sales 
activities and new contracts.Moreover, the company built a complex financial 
operation system to control FC commissions and

Life insurance market will likely face unfavorable cir-
cumstances due to prolonged low economic growth, 
market saturation, and institutional factors. Protec-
tion insurance market is predicted to experience low 
growth of premium income caused by market maturity 
and changes in the government’s health insurance 
policy. Savings insurance market also seems to shrink 
due to increasing capital volatility resulting from the 
IFRS17 Financial Instrument, decrease in tax breaks, 
and changes in commission system. Amid these 
prospects, KB Life Insurance will strive to emerge as a 
value-oriented life insurance company by realizing the 
goals as follows:First, the company will continue to focus on devel-
oping protection insurance products and relevant 
marketing competence while expanding the sales of 
protection and variable insurance products in order to 
create more values.Second, entire value chain and business models will be 
redefined to prepare for changes in digital environment 
and establish differentiated digital-based business 
models that satisfy rapidly-changing customer needs.Third, the company will strengthen monitoring activi-
ties and continuously operate the TF team in response 
to possible increases in volatility of assets, capital, and 
profitability upon the introduction of IFRS9 and IFRS17 
Financial Instrument, while seeking preemptive man-
agement measures to prepare for K-ICS.Lastly, field-first and customer-centric management 
will be promoted to establish a sustainable compa-
ny-wide innovation system.Recorded KRW 21.1 billion,

lations, household debt issue, decreased housing 
construction license, and increase in the amount 
of moving-in. Despite unfavorable conditions, KB 
Real Estate Trust achieved KRW 72.2 billion, up 
21.7% from the previous year, in commission rev-

ularly monitored major issues of constructors and 
checked the progress of construction process on 
a monthly basis.Plans in 2018

remain sluggish due mainly to the government's 
policy to stabilize the property prices, downtrend

ing amount of moving-in. In response to these

of non-face-to-face mortgage lending documents, 
and field survey of used cars for KB Capital, thereby 
promoting lease investigation as a key business.Establishment of an Efficient 
Organizational System
In 2017, KB Credit Information strived to lay the foun-
dation to proactively respond to changes in external 
conditions from the perspective of organization, hu-
man resources, and system. While reducing 20% in 
sales and administrative expenses compared with the 
annual goal, the company improved the cost structure 
from the long perspective by maintaining appropriate 
rate of commission fee and dramatically raised per 
capita productivity.Plans in 2018
Business environments in 2018 are anticipated to be 
unfavorable due to sluggish macroeconomy, tight-
ening regulations on mortgage debts driven by the 
government, and uncertainties in a variety of fields. 
New orders for lease investigation may shrink as well. 
However, the company is still required to be prepared 
about the possible changes in the debt collection 
market because of an increase in the rate of dispos-
able income against household debt.
Amid these conditions, KB Credit Information will strive 
to raise asset quality as a top priority while staying 
focused on improving financial structure aimed at en-
hancing profitability.
The company will continue to focus on recruiting more 
experts in debt collection, retrieving overdues of the 
Group by strengthening collaboration with affiliates 
and debt-specific management systems, and actively 
responding to decrease in debt products. Efforts for 
developing new revenue sources from KB Insurance, 
KB Capital, KB Savings Bank, and lease investigation 
will also continue. Other directions include upgrading 
IT systems, improving productivity, and strengthening 
the management of domestic delinquents in compli-
ance with the policy for financial customer protection.Achieved KRW 24.1 billion 
in earnings from debt 
collection in 201720.0Sales and administrative 
expenses decreased 20.0% 
compared with the annual 
goal on the back of active 
cost-saving activities051Moreover, KB Data Systems has not only en-
hanced IT and financial business capability by 
carrying out training programs and supporting 
voluntary learning groups, but also encouraged 
knowledge and information sharing through ex-
pert groups in order to sharpen individual and 
Group-wide IT capability and competence.Plans in 2018
In  2018,  the  projects  to  build  the  next-gen-
eration  systems  of  KB  Kookmin  Bank  and  KB 
Kookmin  Card  will  begin  in  earnest  while  the 
next-generation  system  of  KB  Capital  will  be 
completed by the end of the year. To that end, 
KB Data Systems plans to secure additional tal-
ents to ensure the successful completion of the 
system  and  strive  to  maximize  customer  sat-
isfaction on its IT services through preemptive 
capability enhancement and marketing activities. 
The company will also be proactive in supporting 
the ERP system redevelopment project  of  KB 
Real Estate Trust and other affiliates’ IT projects, 
playing a pivotal role in enhancing IT capabilities 
of the Group.Performances in 2017
With the advent of the 4th Industrial Revolution, 
a variety of cutting-edge IT technologies such as 
big data, AI, machine learning, and block chain are 
introduced to the financial business. At the same 
time, the expansion of non-face-to-face chan-
nels through internet and mobile environments 
and strategies for ensuring security are emerging 
as key issues. These changes have triggered more 
investments within the Group in SI projects and 
outsourcing, through which KB Data Systems at-
tained KRW 117.9 billion in sales in 2017.Developed Next Generation Systems 
of Affiliates
KB Data Systems participated in the develop-
ment of KB Capital’s next-generation system in 
2017 while supporting the pre-preparation for 
next-generation systems of KB Kookmin Bank 
and KB Kookmin Card. What’s more, intensify-
ing  competition  with  FinTech  companies  and 
internet-only  banks  provokes  investments  in 
new technologies such as big data, AI, and block 
chain  and  needs  for  relevant  businesses.  The 
company has participated in related IT projects 
undertaken within the Group and helped KB Fi-
nancial Group establish and implement digital 
finance strategies by enhancing R&D activities.Enhanced Expertise in IT Operation 
Service
While seeking to maximize IT efficiency of the 
Group by developing and operating Group-wide 
IT systems such as the Group portal and Open 
API, KB Data Systems endeavored to further ex-
pand the scope of IT operation services and en-
hance expertise with the increase of outsourcing 
projects. The number of employees rose from 
330 in the previous year to 380 in 2017 to meet 
the Group’s increasing demand for IT operation 
service and SI development. The company also 
redistributed IT workforce, which had been con-
centrated on services for KB Kookmin Bank, to 
non-banking affiliates including KB Securities, KB 
Insurance, and KB Kookmin Card, promoting a 
balanced growth of IT services within the Group.Attained KRW 117.9 billion in 
sales, an increase of 54.4% 
from the previous year, on 
the back of the Group's 
investment expansionThe number of employees 
increased from 330 in 2016 
to 380 in 2017 to meet 
increasing demands for 
maintenance services02

39  ₩058059Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsAs of December 31, 2017 and 20161. The Parent CompanyKB Financial Group Inc. (the Parent Company) was incorporated on September 29, 2008, under the Financial Holding Companies Act of Korea. KB Financial 
Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) derive substantially all of their revenue and income from providing a broad range of banking and related financial 
services to consumers and corporations primarily in Korea and in selected international markets. The Parent Company’s principal business includes ownership 
and management of subsidiaries and associated companies that are engaged in financial services or activities. In 2011, Kookmin Bank spun off its credit card 
business segment and established a new separate credit card company, KB Kookmin Card Co., Ltd., and KB Investment & Securities Co., Ltd. merged with 
KB Futures Co., Ltd. The Group established KB Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in January 2012, acquired Yehansoul Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in September 2013, and KB 
Savings Bank Co., Ltd. merged with Yehansoul Savings Bank Co., Ltd. in January 2014. In March 2014, the Group acquired Woori Financial Co., Ltd. and changed 
the name to KB Capital Co., Ltd. Meanwhile, the Group included LIG Insurance Co., Ltd. as an associate and changed the name to KB Insurance Co., Ltd. in 
June 2015. Also, the Group included Hyundai Securities Co., Ltd. as an associate in June 2016 and included as a subsidiary in October 2016 by comprehensive 
exchange of shares. Hyundai Securities Co., Ltd. merged with KB Investment&Securities Co., Ltd. in December 2016 and changed the name to KB Securities 
Co., Ltd. in January 2017. KB Insurance Co., Ltd. became one of the subsidiaries through a tender offer in May 2017. KB Insurance Co., Ltd. became one of the 
subsidiaries through a tender offer in May 2017.The Parent Company’s share capital as of December 31, 2017, is \ 2,090,558 million. The Parent Company has been listed on the Korea Exchange (“KRX”) 
since October 10, 2008, and on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) for its American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) since September 29, 2008. Number of 
shares authorized in its Articles of Incorporation is 1,000 million.2. Basis of Preparation
 
2.1 Application of Korean IFRSThe Group maintains its accounting records in Korean won and prepares statutory financial statements in the Korean language (Hangul) in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the Republic of Korea (Korean IFRS). The accompanying consolidated financial statements have 
been condensed, restructured and translated into English from the Korean language financial statements.Certain information attached to the Korean language financial statements, but not required for a fair presentation of the Group's financial position, financial 
performance or cash flows, is not presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Korean IFRS. These are the standards, subsequent amendments 
and related interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") that have been adopted by the Republic of Korea.The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. Management also needs to exercise judgment 
in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are 
significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 2.4.The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual reporting period commencing January 1, 2017. The adoption 
of these amendments did not have any impact on the current period or any prior period and is not likely to affect future periods.060- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1007 Statement of Cash FlowsAmendments to Korean IFRS 1007 Statement of Cash flows requires to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in 
liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash flows.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1012 Income TaxAmendments to Korean IFRS 1012 clarify how to account for deferred tax assets related to debt instruments measured at fair value. Korean IFRS 1012 
provides requirements on the recognition and measurement of current or deferred tax liabilities or assets. The amendments issued clarify the requirements 
on recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses, to address diversity in practice.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1112 Disclosure of Interests in Other EntitiesAmendments to Korean IFRS 1112 clarify when an entity’s interest in a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate is classified as held for sales in accordance 
with Korean IFRS 1105, the entity is required to disclose other information except for summarized financial information in accordance with Korean IFRS 1112.Certain new accounting standards and interpretations that have been published that are not mandatory for annual reporting period commencing January 1, 
2017 and have not been early adopted by the Group are set out below.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1028 Investments in Associates and Joint VenturesWhen an investment in an associate or a joint venture is held by, or it held indirectly through, an entity that is a venture capital organization, or a mutual fund, 
unit trust and similar entities including investment-linked insurance funds, the entity may elect to measure that investment at fair value through profit or loss 
in accordance with Korean IFRS 1109. The amendments clarify that an entity shall make this election separately for each associate of joint venture, at initial 
recognition of the associate or joint venture. The Group will apply these amendments retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, 
and early adoption is permitted. The Group does not expect the amendments to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements because 
the Group is not a venture capital organization.
 
- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1040 Transfers of Investment PropertyParagraph 57 of Korean IFRS 1040 clarifies that a transfer to, or from, investment property, including property under construction, can only be made if there 
has been a change in use that is supported by evidence, and provides a list of circumstances as examples. The amendment will be effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2018. With early adoption permitted. The Group does not expect the amendment to have a significant impact on the financial 
statements.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1102 Share-based PaymentAmendments to Korean IFRS 1102 clarify accounting for a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the classification 
of the transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled. Amendments also clarify that the measurement approach should treat the terms and conditions of 
a cash-settled award in the same way as for an equity-settled award. The amendments will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2018, with early adoption. The Group does not expect the amendments to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.- Enactments to Interpretation 2122 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance ConsiderationAccording to these enactments, the date of the transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related 
asset, expense or income (or part of it) is the date on which an entity initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the 
payment or receipt of advance consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the entity shall determine a date of the transaction for 
each payment or receipt of advance consideration. These enactments will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early 
adoption permitted. The Group does not expect the enactments to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.061- Korean IFRS 1109 Financial InstrumentsThe new standard for financial instruments issued on September 25, 2015 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 with early 
application permitted. This standard will replace Korean IFRS 1039 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The Group will apply the standards 
for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018.The standard requires retrospective application with some exceptions. For example, an entity is not required to restate prior periods in relation to classification, 
measurement and impairment of financial instruments. The standard requires prospective application of its hedge accounting requirements for all hedging 
relationships except the accounting for time value of options and other exceptions.Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments requires all financial assets to be classified and measured on the basis of the entity’s business model for managing 
financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. A new impairment model, an expected credit loss model, is introduced 
and any subsequent changes in expected credit losses will be recognized in profit or loss. Also, hedge accounting rules amended to extend the hedging 
relationship, which consists only of eligible hedging instruments and hedged items, qualifies for hedge accounting.An effective implementation of Korean IFRS 1109 requires preparation processes including financial impact assessment, accounting policy establishment, 
accounting system development and the system stabilization. The impact on the Group’s financial statements due to the application of the standard is 
dependent on judgements made in applying the standard, financial instruments held by the Group and macroeconomic variables.
 
Within the Group, Korean IFRS 1109 Task Force Team ('TFT') has been set up to prepare for implementation of Korean IFRS 1109 since October 2015. There 
are three stages for implementation of Korean IFRS, such as analysis, design and implementation, and preparation for application. The Group analyzed the 
financial impacts of Korean IFRS 1109 on its consolidated financial statements.StagePeriodProcess123From Oct. to Dec. 2015 (for 3 months)From Jan. to Dec. 2016 (for 12 months)From Jan. 2017 to Mar. 2018 (for 15 months)Analysis of GAAP differences and development of methodology
Development of methodology, definition of business requirement, 
and the system development and test.
Preparation for opening balances of the financial statementsThe Group performed an impact assessment to identify potential financial effects of applying Korean IFRS 1109. The assessment was 
performed based on available information as at December 31, 2017, and the results of the assessment are explained as below. The results of 
the assessment in the financial effects as at December 31, 2017 may change due to additional information and decisions that the Group may 
obtain in the future.(a) Classification and Measurement of Financial AssetsWhen implementing Korean IFRS 1109, the classification of financial assets will be driven by the Group’s business model for managing the 
financial assets and contractual terms of cash flow. The following table shows the classification of financial assets measured subsequently at 
amortized cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income and at fair value through profit or loss. For hybrid (combined) instruments, 
the Group does not measure an embedded derivative separately from its host contract, financial assets with embedded derivatives are classified 
in their entirety.Business modelSolely represent payments of principal and interestAll otherContractual cash flows characteristicsHold the financial asset for the collection of

2 A designation at fair value through other comprehensive income is allowed only if the financial instrument is the equity investment that is not held for trading (irrevocable).062With the implementation of Korean IFRS 1109, the criteria to classify the financial assets at amortized cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income are more strictly applied than the criteria applied with Korean IFRS 1039. Accordingly, the financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss may increase by implementing Korean IFRS 1109 and may result an extended fluctuation in profit or loss.
The following table presents the impact of the change in classification and measurement of financial instrument (excluding derivatives) held by 
the Group as at December 31, 2017, using the financial instrument accounting system developed by the Group with applying Korean IFRS 1109.Classification in accordance withAmount in accordance withKorean IFRS 1039Korean IFRS 1109Korean IFRS 10391Korean IFRS 11091(In millions of Korean won)Cash and due from financial institutions Measured at amortized cost\19,817,825 \Recognized at fair value through profit or loss2Financial assets at fair value through profit or lossTrading Securities-Debt

2  In accordance with Korea IFRS 1104, the Group applied Overlay approach to the financial instruments related to insurance contracts (cash and due from financial institutions \ 
186,293 million, Loans \ 587 million, Available-for-sale securities \ 6,349,091 million, and Held-to-maturity securities \ 57,386 million). For the financial assets designated as fair 
value through profit or loss, the Group reclassifies the amount reported in profit or loss for the designated financial assets applying Korean IFRS 1109 to the amount that would have 
been reported in profit or loss for the designated financial assets of the insurer has applied Korean IFRS 1039.
3  The financial assets amounting to \ 2,050,052 million that was previously classified as financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with Korean IFRS 
1039, will be reclassified as financial assets recognized at fair value through profit or loss, even if the financial assets are not designated at fair value through profit or loss.With the implementation of Korean IFRS 1109, as at December 31, 2017, \ 2,782,821 million of cash and due from financial institutions, \ 629,223 million of 
loans, \ 9,312,534 million of financial assets available-for-sales and \ 269,661 million of assets held-to-maturity are classified to financial assets recognize 
at fair value through profit or loss. These classifications will increase the financial assets recognized at fair value through profit or loss from 7.7% to 10.8% over 
the total financial assets (excluding derivatives) of \ 418,442,272 million and may result an extended fluctuation in profit or loss.(b) Classification and Measurement of Financial LiabilitiesKorean IFRS 1109 requires that the amount of the change of fair value attributable to changes in the credit risk in the financial liabilities designated at fair 
value through profit or loss will be recognized in other comprehensive income, not in profit or loss, unless this treatment of the credit risk component creates 
or enlarges a measurement mismatch. Amounts presented in other comprehensive income are not subsequently transferred to profit or loss.063Under Korean IFRS 1039, all financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss recognized their fair value change in profit or loss. However, 
under Korean IFRS 1109, certain fair value change will be recognized in other comprehensive income and as a result, profit or loss from fair value change may 
decrease. Based on results from the impact assessment, the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit 
or loss in applying Korean IFRS 1109 is \ 10,078,288 million and \ 10,438 million is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability.(c) Impairment: Financial Assets and Contract AssetsThe new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses (ECL) rather than only incurred credit losses 
as is the case under Korean IFRS 1039. It applies to financial assets classified at amortized cost, debt instruments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, lease receivables, contract assets, loan commitments and certain financial guarantee contracts.Under Korean IFRS 1109, a credit event (or impairment ‘trigger’) no longer has to occur before credit losses are recognized. The Group will always recognize 
(at a minimum) 12-month expected credit losses in profit or loss. Lifetime expected losses will be recognized on assets for which there is a significant increase 
in credit risk after initial recognition.Stage123No significant increase in credit risk 
after initial recognition

recognition as a loss allowance.According to the financial assessment, the Group owns loss allowance set out below.Classification in accordance withLoss allowance in accordance withKorean IFRS 1039Korean IFRS 1109Korean IFRS 1039(a)Korean IFRS 1109(b)(In millions of Korean won)Difference(b)-(a)Loans and receivables

    542,539064(d) Hedge AccountingHedge accounting mechanics (fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and hedge of net investments in a foreign operations) required by Korean 
IFRS 1039 remains unchanged in Korean IFRS 1109, however, the new hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments 
more closely with the Group’s risk management practices. As a general rule, more hedge relationships might be eligible for hedge accounting, 
as the standard introduces a more principles-based approach. Korean IFRS 1109 allows more hedging instruments and hedged items to qualify 
for hedge accounting, and relaxes the hedge accounting requirement by removing two hedge effectiveness tests that are a prospective test 
to ensure that the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective and a quantitative retrospective test (within range of 80-125%) to 
ensure that the hedging relationship has been highly effective throughout the reporting period.With implementation of Korean IFRS 1109, volatility in profit or loss may be reduced as some items that were not eligible as hedged items or 
hedging instruments under Korean IFRS 1039 are now eligible under Korean IFRS 1109.Furthermore, when the Group first applies Korean IFRS 1109, it may choose as its accounting policy to continue to apply all of the hedge 
accounting requirements of Korean IFRS 1039 instead of the requirements of Korean IFRS 1109.Meanwhile, as at December 31,2017, the Group has not applied hedge accounting more for the risk management practices which can be 
applied hedge accounting by Korean IFRS 1109 but cannot be satisfied with hedge accounting requirements by Korean IFRS 1039.- Korean IFRS 1115, Revenue from Contracts with CustomersKorean IFRS 1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers issued on November 6, 2015 replaces Korean IFRS 1018 Revenue, Korean IFRS 1011 
Construction Contracts, Interpretation 2031 Revenue-Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services, Interpretation 2113 Customer Loyalty 
Programs, Interpretation 2115 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate and Interpretation 2118 Transfers of assets from customers.Korean IFRS 1018 and other, the current standard, provide revenue recognition criteria by type of transactions; such as, sales goods, the 
rendering of services, interest income, royalty income, dividend income, and construction contracts. However, Korean IFRS 1115, the new 
standard, is based on the principle that revenue is recognized when control of a good or service transfers to a customer – so the notion of 
control replaces the existing notion of risks and rewards.A new five-step process must be applied before revenue from contract with customer can be recognized:- Identify contracts with customers 
- Identify the separate performance obligation 
- Determine the transaction price of the contract 
- Allocate the transaction price to each of the separate performance obligations, and 
- Recognize the revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.The Group will apply new standard for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The 
Group performed a preliminary impact assessment on the employees of the accounting department based on the current situation and 
available information as at December 31, 2017 to identify potential financial effects of applying Korean IFRS 1115. As a result, the Group does 
not expect that enactment of this statement will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. The results of the 
assessment as at December 31, 2017, may change due to additional information that the Group may obtain after the assessment.- Korean IFRS 1116 LeasesKorean IFRS 1116 Leases issued on May 22, 2017 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption 
permitted. This standard will replace Korean IFRS 1017 Leases, Interpretation 2104 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, 
Interpretation 2015 Operating Leases-Incentives, and Interpretation 2027 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.065At inception of a contract, the entity shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Also, at the date of initial application, the entity 
shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease in accordance with the standard. However, the entity will not need to reassess all 
contracts with applying the practical expedient because the entity elected to apply the practical expedient only to contracts entered before 
the date of initial application.For a contract that is, or contains, a lease, the entity shall account for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from 
non-lease components of the contract. A lease is required to recognize a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased 
asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The lessee may elect not to apply the requirements to short-term 
lease (a lease term of 12 months or less at the commencement date) and low value assets (e.g. underlying assets below $ 5,000). In addition, 
as a practical expedient, the lessee may elect, by class of underlying asset, not to separate non-lease components from lease components, 
and instead account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease component.The classification criteria between a financial lease and an operating lease for a lessor under Korean IFRS 1116 are similar to Korean IFRS 1017.The Group is currently in progress of analyzing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of 
Korean IFRS 1116.2.2 Measurement BasisThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified.2.3 Functional and Presentation CurrencyItems included in the financial statements of each entity of the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
entity operates (the “functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Korean won, which is the Parent Company’s functional 
and presentation currency (Notes 3.2.1 and 3.2.2).2.4 Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions 
that may have a significant impact on the assets (liabilities) and incomes (expenses). Management’s estimates of outcomes may differ from actual outcomes 
if management’s estimates and assumptions based on management’s best judgment at the reporting date are different from the actual environment.Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and any change in an accounting estimate is recognized prospectively by including it in profit or loss in 
the period of the change, if the change affects that period only. Alternatively if the change in accounting estimate affects both the period of change and 
future periods, that change is recognized in the profit or loss of all those periods.Uncertainty in estimates and assumptions with significant risk that may result in material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements are as follows:2.4.1 Income taxesThe Group is operating in numerous countries and the income generated from these operations is subject to income taxes based on tax laws and 
interpretations of tax authorities in numerous jurisdictions. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain. If certain portion of the taxable income is not used for investments, increase in wages, or dividends in accordance with the Tax System for 
Recirculation of Corporate Income, the Group is liable to pay additional income tax calculated based on the tax laws. The new tax system is effective for 
three years from 2015. Accordingly, the measurement of current and deferred income tax is affected by the tax effects from the new system. As the Group’s 
income tax is dependent on the investments, increase in wages and dividends, there exists uncertainty with regard to measuring the final tax effects.0662.4.2 Fair value of financial instrumentsThe fair value of financial instruments where no active market exists or where quoted prices are not otherwise available is determined by using valuation 
techniques. Financial instruments, which are not actively traded in the market and those with less transparent market prices, will have less objective fair 
values and require broad judgment on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty in market factors and assumptions in price determination and other risks.As described in the significant accounting policies in Note 3.3, ‘Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments’, diverse valuation techniques are 
used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, from generally accepted market valuation models to internally developed valuation models that 
incorporate various types of assumptions and variables.2.4.3 Provisions for credit losses (allowances for loan losses, provisions for acceptances and guarantees, and unused loan 
commitments)The Group determines and recognizes allowances for losses on loans through impairment testing and recognizes provisions for guarantees, and unused loan 
commitments. The accuracy of provisions for credit losses is determined by the methodology and assumptions used for estimating expected cash flows of 
the borrower for individually assessed allowances of loans, collectively assessed allowances for groups of loans, guarantees and unused loan commitments.2.4.4 Net defined benefit liabilityThe present value of net defined benefit liability depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions 
(Note 24).2.4.5 Impairment of goodwillThe recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations to test whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment (Note 15).3. Significant Accounting PoliciesThe significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated.3.1 Consolidation3.1.1 SubsidiariesSubsidiaries are companies that are controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The existence and effects of potential 
voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date when control is transferred to the Group and de-consolidated from the date when control is lost.If a subsidiary uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar 
circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to make the subsidiary’s accounting policies conform to those of the Group when the subsidiary’s 
financial statements are used by the Group in preparing the consolidated financial statements.067Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests, if any. 
Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests 
having a deficit balance.Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions; that is, as transactions with the 
owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net 
assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change 
in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained 
interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that 
entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred is measured at the fair values of the assets 
transferred, and identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially measured at their fair 
values at the acquisition date. The Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis in the event of 
liquidation, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognized amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.In a business combination achieved in stages, the Group shall remeasure its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value 
and recognize the resulting gain or loss, if any, in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, as appropriate. In prior reporting periods, the Group may 
have recognized changes in the value of its equity interest in the acquiree in other comprehensive income. If so, the amount that was recognised in other 
comprehensive income shall be recognised on the same basis as would be required if the Group had disposed directly of the previously held equity interest.The Group applies the book amount method to account for business combinations of entities under a common control. Identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their book amounts on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. In addition, the 
difference between the sum of consolidated book amounts of the assets and liabilities transferred and accumulated other comprehensive income; and the 
consideration paid is recognized as capital surplus.3.1.2 Associates and Joint venturesAssociates and joint ventures are entities over which the Group has significant influence in the financial and operating policy decisions. If the Group holds 
20% or more of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the Group has significant influence.Under the equity method, investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is increased or decreased 
to recognize the Group’s share of the profit or loss of the investee and changes in the investee’s equity after the date of acquisition. The Group’s share 
of the profit or loss of the investee is recognized in the Group’s profit or loss. Distributions received from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the 
investment. Profit and loss resulting from ‘upstream’ and ‘downstream’ transactions between the Group and associates are eliminated to the extent at the 
Group’s interest in associates. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that 
there is no evidence of impairment.If associates and joint ventures use accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in 
similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to make the associate’s accounting policies conform to those of the Group when the associate’s 
financial statements are used by the Group in applying equity method.After the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognized, only to the extent that the 
Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.068The Group determines at each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the investments in the associates and joint ventures are 
impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associates and its 
carrying value and recognizes the amount as ‘non-operating income(expense)’ in the statements of comprehensive income.3.1.3 Structured entityA structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity. When 
the Group decides whether it has power to the structured entities in which the Group has interests, it considers factors such as the purpose, the form, the 
practical ability to direct the relevant activities of a structured entity, the nature of its relationship with a structured entity and the amount of exposure to 
variable returns.3.1.4 Trusts and fundsThe Group provides management services for trust assets, collective investment and other funds. These trusts and funds are not consolidated in the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements, except for trusts and funds over which the Group has control.3.1.5 Intra-group transactionsAll intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized gains arising on intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence 
of impairment.3.2 Foreign Currency3.2.1 Foreign currency transactionsA foreign currency transaction is recorded, on initial recognition in the functional currency, by applying the spot exchange rate between the functional 
currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting period, foreign currency monetary items are translated 
using the closing rate which is the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the spot exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined and non-monetary items that are measured in terms 
of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction.Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were 
translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous consolidated financial statements are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they 
arise, except for exchange differences arising on net investments in a foreign operation and financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment. 
When gains or losses on a non-monetary item are recognized in other comprehensive income, any exchange component of those gains or losses are 
also recognized in other comprehensive income. Conversely, when gains or losses on a non-monetary item are recognized in profit or loss, any exchange 
component of those gains or losses are also recognized in profit or loss.3.2.2 Foreign operationsThe financial performance and financial position of all foreign operations, whose functional currencies differ from the Group’s presentation currency, are 
translated into the Group’s presentation currency using the following procedures.Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting period. Income and 
expenses in the statement of comprehensive income presented are translated at average exchange rates for the period. All resulting exchange differences 
are recognized in other comprehensive income.069Any goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising from 
the acquisition of that foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation. Thus, they are expressed in the functional currency of 
the foreign operation and are translated into the presentation currency at the closing rate.On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation, recognized in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the separate component of equity, is reclassified from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification adjustment) 
when the gains or losses on disposal are recognized. On the partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the Group redistributes the 
proportionate share of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognized in other comprehensive income to the non-controlling interests 
in that foreign operation. In any other partial disposal of a foreign operation, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss only the proportionate share of the 
cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognized in other comprehensive income.3.3 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments3.3.1 Initial recognitionThe Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets (a purchase or sale of a financial asset under a contract whose terms require 
delivery of the financial instruments within the time frame established generally by market regulation or practice) is recognized and derecognized using 
trade date accounting.The Group classifies financial assets as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity financial assets, available-for-sale financial 
assets, or loans and receivables, or other financial assets. The Group classifies financial liabilities as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, or 
other financial liabilities. The classification depends on the nature and holding purpose of the financial instrument at initial recognition in the consolidated 
financial statements.At initial recognition, a financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at 
fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability. The fair 
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The 
fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (that is, the fair value of the consideration given or received) in an 
arm’s length transaction.3.3.2 Subsequent measurementAfter initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at amortized cost or fair value based on classification at initial recognition.Amortized cost
The amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition and 
adjusted to reflect principal repayments, cumulative amortization using the effective interest method and any reduction (directly or through the use of an 
allowance account) for impairment or uncollectibility.Fair value
Fair values, which the Group primarily uses for the measurement of financial instruments, are the published price quotations based on market prices or 
dealer price quotations of financial instruments traded in an active market where available. These are the best evidence of fair value. A financial instrument 
is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, an entity in the same industry, 
pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.If the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is determined either by using a valuation technique or independent third-party valuation 
service. Valuation techniques include using recent arm's length market transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, if available, referencing to the 
current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.070The Group uses valuation models that are commonly used by market participants and customized for the Group to determine fair values of common over-
the-counter (OTC) derivatives such as options, interest rate swaps and currency swaps which are based on the inputs observable in markets. For more 
complex instruments, the Group uses internally developed models, which are usually based on valuation methods and techniques generally used within the 
industry, or a value measured by an independent external valuation institution as the fair values if all or some of the inputs to the valuation models are not 
market observable and therefore it is necessary to estimate fair value based on certain assumptions.The Group’s Fair Value Evaluation Committee, which consists of the risk management department, trading department and accounting department, 
reviews the appropriateness of internally developed valuation models, and approves the selection and changing of the external valuation institution and 
other considerations related to fair value measurement. The review results on the fair valuation models are reported to the Market Risk Management 
subcommittee by the Fair Value Evaluation Committee on a regular basis.If the valuation technique does not reflect all factors which market participants would consider in setting a price, the fair value is adjusted to reflect those 
factors. Those factors include counterparty credit risk, bid-ask spread, liquidity risk and others.The chosen valuation technique makes maximum use of market inputs and relies as little as possible on entity-specific inputs. It incorporates all factors that 
market participants would consider in setting a price and is consistent with economic methodologies applied for pricing financial instruments. Periodically, 
the Group calibrates the valuation technique and tests its validity using prices of observable current market transactions of the same instrument or based on 
other relevant observable market data.3.3.3 DerecognitionDerecognition is the removal of a previously recognized financial asset or financial liability from the statement of financial position. The Group derecognizes 
a financial asset or a financial liability when, and only when:Derecognition of financial assets
Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or the financial assets have been transferred 
and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are also transferred, or all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial 
assets are neither substantially transferred nor retained and the Group has not retained control. If the Group neither transfers nor disposes of substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets, the Group continues to recognize the financial asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in 
the financial asset.If the Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of 
the financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset in its entirely and recognize a financial liability for the consideration received.Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognized from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.3.3.4 OffsettingFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated statements of financial position where there is a legally enforceable 
right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the assets and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally 
enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency 
or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparty.3.4 Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, foreign currency, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts 
of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.0713.5 Non-derivative Financial Assets3.5.1 Financial assets at fair value through profit or lossThis category comprises two sub-categories: financial assets classified as held for trading, and financial assets designated by the Group as at fair value 
through profit or loss upon initial recognition.A non-derivative financial asset is classified as held for trading if either: 
- It is acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term, or
-  It is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-
term profit-taking.The Group may designate certain financial assets, other than held for trading, upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss when one of the 
following conditions is met:-  It eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as 'an accounting mismatch') that would 
otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on different bases.
-  A group of financial assets is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or 
investment strategy, and information about the group is provided internally on that basis to the Group's key management personnel.
-  A contract contains one or more embedded derivatives; the Group may designate the entire hybrid (combined) contract as a financial asset at fair value 
through profit or loss if allowed by Korean IFRS 1039 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement.After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is measured at fair value and gains or losses arising from a change in the fair value 
are recognized in profit or loss. Interest income, dividend income, and gains or losses from sale and repayment from financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as net gains on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.3.5.2 Financial InvestmentsAvailable-for-sale and held-to-maturity financial assets are presented as financial investments.Available-for-sale financial assets
Profit or loss of financial assets classified as available for sale, except for impairment loss and foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from changes in 
amortized cost of debt securities, is recognized as other comprehensive income, and cumulative profit or loss is reclassified from equity to current profit or 
loss at the derecognition of the financial asset, and it is recognized as part of other operating profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income.However, interest income measured using the effective interest method is recognized in current profit or loss, and dividends of financial assets classified as 
available-for-sale are recognized when the right to receive payment is established. 
 
Available-for-sale financial assets denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate. For available-for-sale debt securities denominated 
in foreign currency, exchange differences resulting from changes in amortized cost are recognized in profit or loss as part of other operating income and 
expenses. For available-for-sale equity securities denominated in foreign currency, the entire change in fair value including any exchange component is 
recognized in other comprehensive income.Held-to-maturity financial assets
Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that the Group’s management 
has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective 
interest method after initial recognition and interest income is recognized using the effective interest method.0723.5.3 Loans and receivablesNon-derivative financial assets which meet the following conditions are classified as loans and receivables:- Those with fixed or determinable payments.
- Those that are not quoted in an active market.
- Those that the Group does not intend to sell immediately or in the near term.
- Those that the Group, upon initial recognition, does not designate as available-for-sale or as at fair value through profit or loss.After initial recognition, these are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
If the financial asset is purchased under an agreement to resale the asset at a fixed price or at a price that provides a lender's return on the purchase price, 
the consideration paid is recognized as loans and receivables.3.6 Impairment of Financial AssetsThe Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets except for 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred, if 
and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) 
and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably 
estimated. However, losses expected as a result of future events, no matter how likely, are not recognized.Objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired includes the following loss events:- Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor.
- A breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments.
-  The lender, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower’s financial difficulty, granting to the borrower a concession that the lender would not 
otherwise consider.
- It becomes probable that the borrower will declare bankruptcy or undergo financial reorganization.
- The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.
-  Observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a group of financial assets since the initial 
recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the portfolio.In addition to the types of events in the preceding paragraphs, objective evidence of impairment for an investment in an equity instrument classified as an 
available-for-sale financial asset includes a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its cost. The Group considers the decline in the fair value 
of over 30% against the original cost as a “significant decline”. A decline is considered as prolonged if the period, in which the fair value of the financial 
asset has been below its original cost at initial recognition, is same as or more than six months.If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured and recognized in profit or loss as either 
provisions for credit loss or other operating income and expenses.3.6.1 Loans and receivablesThe amount of the loss on loans and receivables carried at amortized cost is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective 
interest rate.The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant (individual 
assessment of impairment).073Financial assets that are not individually significant assess objective evidence of impairment individually or collectively. If the Group determines that no 
objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial 
assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment (collective assessment of impairment).Individual assessment of impairment
Individual assessment of impairment losses are calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows of a loan at its original effective interest rate and 
comparing the resultant present value with the loan’s current carrying amount. This process normally encompasses management’s best estimate, such as 
operating cash flow of the borrower and net realizable value of any collateral held.Collective assessment of impairment
A methodology based on historical loss experience is used to estimate inherent incurred loss on groups of assets for collective assessment of impairment. 
Such methodology incorporates factors such as type of collateral, product and borrowers, credit rating, loss emergence period, recovery period and applies 
probability of default on a group of assets and loss given default by type of recovery method. Also, consistent assumptions are applied to form a formula-
based model in estimating inherent loss and to determine factors on the basis of historical loss experience and current condition. The methodology 
and assumptions used for collective assessment of impairment are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss 
experience.Impairment loss on loans reduces the carrying amount of the asset through use of an allowance account, and when a loan becomes uncollectable, it is 
written off against the related allowance account. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and is objectively related to the 
subsequent event after recognition of impairment, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account. The amount of 
the reversal is recognized in profit or loss.3.6.2 Available-for-sale financial assetsWhen a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognized in other comprehensive income and there is objective evidence 
that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss (the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial 
asset previously recognized in profit or loss) that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss as part of 
other operating income and expenses. The impairment loss on available-for-sale financial assets is directly from the carryng amount.If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event 
occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in profit or loss, a portion of the impairment loss is reversed up to but not exceeding the previously 
recorded impairment loss, with the amount of the reversal recognized in profit or loss as part of other operating income and expenses in the statement of 
comprehensive income. However, impairment losses recognized in profit or loss for an available-for-sale equity instrument classified as available for sale are 
not reversed through profit or loss.3.6.3 Held-to-maturity financial assetsIf there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on held-to-maturity financial assets carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the 
loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial 
asset's original effective interest rate. The amount of the loss is recognized in profit or loss as part of other operating income and expenses. The impairment 
loss on held-to-maturity financial assets is directly deducted from the carrying amount.In the case of a financial asset classified as held to maturity, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and it is objectively 
related to an event occurring after the impairment is recognized, a portion of the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed up to but not exceeding 
the extent of amortized cost at the date of recovery. The amount of reversal is recognized in profit or loss as part of other operating income and expenses 
in the statement of comprehensive income.0743.7 Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Group enters into numerous derivative financial instrument contracts such as currency forwards, interest rate swaps, currency swaps and others for 
trading purposes or to manage its exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange, amongst others. These derivative financial instruments 
are presented as derivative financial instruments within the consolidated financial statements irrespective of transaction purpose and subsequent 
measurement requirement.The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an 
unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge) and the risk of changes in cash flow (cash flow hedge). The Group designates non-derivatives as hedging 
instruments to hedge the risk of foreign exchange of a net investment in a foreign operation (hedge of net investment).At the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the Group's risk management objective and 
strategy for undertaking the hedge. That documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the 
risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value 
attributable to the hedged risk.3.7.1 Derivative financial instruments held for tradingAll derivative financial instruments, except for derivatives that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, are measured at fair value. Gains or losses 
arising from a change in fair value are recognized in profit or loss as part of net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.3.7.2 Fair value hedgesIf derivatives qualify for a fair value hedge, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to 
the hedged risk are recognized in profit or loss as part of other operating income and expenses. Fair value hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if 
the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the 
designation. Once fair value hedge accounting is discontinued, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item is fully amortized to profit or loss by 
the maturity of the financial instrument using the effective interest method.3.7.3 Cash flow hedgesThe portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized directly in other comprehensive income 
and the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized in profit or loss. The associated gains or losses that were previously 
recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during 
which the hedged forecast cash flows affects profit or loss. Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if the hedging instrument expires or 
is sold, terminated or exercised, or the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation. When the cash flow 
hedge accounting is discontinued, the cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument that have been recognized in other comprehensive income are 
reclassified to profit or loss over the year in which the forecast transaction occurs. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative 
gains or losses that had been recognized in other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.3.7.4 Hedge of net investmentIf financial liabilities qualify for a net investment hedge, the effective portion of changes in fair value of hedging instrument is recognized in other 
comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognized in profit. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the 
hedge that has been recognized in other comprehensive income will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss as a reclassification 
adjustment on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation in accordance with Korean IFRS 1039, Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement.0753.7.5 Embedded derivativesAn embedded derivative is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a 
derivative if, and only if the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract and a 
separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative and the hybrid (combined) instrument is not 
measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. Gains or losses arising from a change in the fair value of an embedded derivative 
separated from the host contract are recognized in profit or loss as part of net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.3.7.6 Day one gain and lossIf the Group uses a valuation technique that incorporates data not obtained from observable markets for the fair value at initial recognition of the financial 
instrument, there may be a difference between the transaction price and the amount determined using that valuation technique. In these circumstances, 
the difference is deferred and not recognized in profit or loss, and is amortized by using the straight-line method over the life of the financial instrument. If 
the fair value of the financial instrument is subsequently determined using observable market inputs, the remaining deferred amount is recognized in profit 
or loss as part of net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss or other operating income and expenses.3.8 Property and Equipment3.8.1 Recognition and measurementAll property and equipment that qualify for recognition as an asset are measured at cost and subsequently carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation 
and any accumulated impairment losses.The cost of property and equipment includes any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating in the manner intended by management and the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on 
which it is located.Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when they prolong the useful life or enhance values of the assets but the costs of the day-to-day servicing of 
the assets such as repair and maintenance costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. When part of an item of an asset has a useful life different from 
that of the entire asset, it is recognized as a separate asset.3.8.2 DepreciationLand is not depreciated, whereas other property and equipment are depreciated using the method that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s future 
economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group. The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value. As for 
leased assets, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is fully depreciated over the 
shorter of the lease term and its useful life.Each part of an item of property and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.The depreciation method and estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:Property and equipment
Buildings and structures
Leasehold improvements
Equipment and vehicles
Finance leased assetsDepreciation methodStraight-lineDeclining-balance/ Straight-line

from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.9 Investment Properties3.9.1 Recognition and MeasurementProperties held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both are classified as investment properties. Investment properties are measured initially at their 
cost and subsequently the cost model is used.3.9.2 DepreciationLand is not depreciated, whereas other investment properties are depreciated using the method that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s future 
economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group. The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value.The depreciation method and estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:Investment propertyBuildingsDepreciation methodStraight-lineEstimated useful life40 yearsThe residual value, the useful life and the depreciation method applied to an asset are reviewed at least at each financial year end and, if expectations differ 
from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.10 Intangible AssetsIntangible assets are measured initially at cost and subsequently carried at their cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment 
losses.Intangible assets, except for goodwill and membership rights, are amortized using the straight-line method or double declining balance method with no 
residual value over their estimated useful economic life since the asset is available for use.Intangible assetsIndustrial property rightsSoftwareFinance leased assetsVOBA

an intangible asset is not being amortized because its useful life is considered to be indefinite, the Group carries out a review in each accounting period to 
confirm whether or not events and circumstances still support the assumption of an indefinite useful life. If they do not, the change from the indefinite to 
finite useful life is accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.0773.10.1 Value of Business Acquired (VOBA)The Group recorded Value of business acquired (VOBA) as intangible assets, which are the differences between the fair value of insurance liabilities and book 
value calculated based on the accounting policy of the acquired company. VOBA is an estimated present value of future cash flow of long-term insurance 
contracts at the acquisition date. VOBA is amortized for above estimated useful life using declining balance method, the depreciation is recognized as 
insurance expense.3.10.2 GoodwillRecognition and measurement
Goodwill acquired from business combinations before January 1, 2010, is stated at its carrying amount which was recognized under the Group’s previous 
accounting policy, prior to the transition to Korean IFRS.Goodwill acquired from business combinations after January 1, 2010, is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, 
fair value of non-controlling interest and the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the net 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the business acquired, the difference 
is recognized in profit or loss.For each business combination, the Group decides whether the non-controlling interest in the acquiree is initially measured at fair value or at the non-
controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs incurred to effect a business combination are charged to expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services 
are received, except for the costs to issue debt or equity securities.Additional acquisitions of non-controlling interest
Additional acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as equity transactions. Therefore, no additional goodwill is recognized.Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is not amortized and is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. However, goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an 
investment in associates is not separately recognized and an impairment loss recognized is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, which forms part 
of the carrying amount of the investment in the associates.3.10.3 Subsequent expenditureSubsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it enhances values of the assets. Internally generated intangible assets, such as goodwill and trade name, 
are not recognized as assets but expensed as incurred.3.11 Leases3.11.1 Finance leaseA lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. At the commencement of the lease term, 
the Group recognizes finance leases as assets and liabilities in its statements of financial position at amounts equal to the fair value of the leased property 
or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. Any initial direct costs of the lessee are added 
to the amount recognized as an asset.Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each 
period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Contingent rents are charged as 
expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.078The depreciable amount of a leased asset is allocated to each accounting period during the period of expected use on a systematic basis consistent with 
the depreciation policy the Group adopts for depreciable assets that are owned. If there is reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain ownership by the 
end of the lease term, the period of expected use is the useful life of the asset; otherwise, the asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term 
and its useful life.3.11.2 Operating leaseA lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership.Leases in the financial statements of lessors
Lease income from operating leases are recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is more 
representative of the time pattern in which use benefit derived from the leased asset is diminished. Initial direct costs incurred by lessors in negotiating and 
arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as 
the lease income.Leases in the financial statements of lessees
Lease payments under an operating lease (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the asset’s benefit.3.12 Greenhouse Gas Emission Rights and LiabilitiesThe Group measured at zero the emission rights received free of charge from the government following the Enforcement of Allocation and Trading of 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Allowances. Emission rights purchased are measured initially at cost and subsequently carried at their costs less any accumulated 
impairment losses. Emission liabilities are measured as the sum of the carrying amount of emission allowances held by the Group and best estimate of 
the expenditure required to settle the obligation for any excess emissions at the end of reporting period. The emission rights and liabilities are classified as 
‘intangible assets’ and ‘provisions’, respectively, in the consolidated statement of financial position.The emission rights held for trading are measured at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. The changes in fair value and 
gain or loss on disposal are classified as non-operating income and expenses.3.13 Impairment of Non-Financial AssetsThe Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset, except for (i) deferred income tax assets, 
(ii) assets arising from employee benefits and (iii) non-current assets (or group of assets to be sold) classified as held for sale, may be impaired. If any such 
indication exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. However, irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, the 
Group tests (i) goodwill acquired in a business combination, (ii) intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and (iii) intangible assets not yet available for 
use for impairment annually by comparing their carrying amount with their recoverable amount.The recoverable amount is estimated for the individual asset. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, the Group 
determines the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs (the asset’s cash-generating unit). A cash-generating unit is the 
smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The 
recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows 
expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit that are discounted by a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. That reduction 
is an impairment loss and recognized immediately in profit or loss. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is 
allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The impairment loss is allocated first 
to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the 
carrying amount of each asset in the unit.079An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there 
is any indication that an impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset, other than goodwill, may no longer exist or may have decreased, and an 
impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill shall be reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used 
to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The increased carrying amount of an asset other than goodwill 
attributable to a reversal of an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) 
had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.3.14 Non-Current Assets Held for SaleA non-current asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must 
be highly probable. A non-current asset (or disposal group) classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell which is measured in accordance with the applicable Korean IFRS, immediately before the initial classification of the asset (or disposal group) as 
held for sale. A non-current asset while it is classified as held for sale or while it is part of a disposal group classified as held for sale is not depreciated (or 
amortized).Impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. Gains are recognized for 
any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of the cumulative impairment loss that has been recognized.3.15 Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or LossFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are financial liabilities held for trading. After initial recognition, financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss are measured at fair value and gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value, and gains or losses from sale and repayment of financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized as net gains on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss in the statement of 
comprehensive income.3.16 Insurance ContractsKB Life Insurance Co., Ltd., and KB Insurance Co., of the subsidiaries of the Group, issues insurance contracts.Insurance contracts are defined as “a contract under which one party (the insurer) accepts significant insurance risk from another party by agreeing to 
compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder”. A contract that qualifies as an insurance contract 
remains an insurance contract until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire. Such a contract that does not contain significant insurance risk is 
classified as an investment contract and is within the scope of Korean IFRS 1039, Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement to the extent that 
it gives rise to a financial asset or financial liability, except if the investment contract contains a Discretionary Participation Features (DPF). If the contract 
has a DPF, the contract is subject to Korean IFRS 1104, Insurance Contracts. The Group recognizes assets (liabilities) and gains (losses) relating to insurance 
contracts as other assets (liabilities) in the statements of financial position, and as other operating income (expenses) in the statements of comprehensive 
income, respectively.3.16.1 Insurance premiumsThe Group recognizes collected premiums as revenue on the due date of collection of premiums from insurance contracts and the collected premium which 
is unmatured at the end of the reporting period is recognized as unearned premium.3.16.2 Insurance liabilitiesThe Group recognizes a liability for future claims, refunds, policyholders’ dividends and related expenses as follows:080Premium reserve
A premium reserve refers to an amount based on the net premium method for payment of future claims with respect to events covered by insurance 
policies which have not yet occurred as of the reporting period.Reserve for outstanding claims
A reserve for outstanding claims refers to the amount not yet paid, out of an amount to be paid or expected to be paid with respect to the insured events 
which have arisen as of the end of each fiscal year.Unearned premium reserve
Unearned premium refers to the portion of the premium that has been paid in advance for insurance that has not yet been provided. An unearned premium 
reserve refers to the amount maintained by the insurer to refund in the event of either party cancelling the contract.Policyholders’ dividends reserve
Policyholders’ dividends reserve including an interest rate guarantee reserve, a mortality dividend reserve and an interest rate difference dividend reserve is 
recognized for the purpose of provisioning for policyholders’ dividends in the future in accordance with statutes or insurance terms and conditions.3.16.3 Liability adequacy testThe Group assesses at each reporting period whether its insurance liabilities are adequate, using current estimates of all future contractual cash flows 
and related cash flow such as claims handling cost, as well as cash flows resulting from embedded options and guarantees under its insurance contracts 
in accordance with Korean IFRS 1104. If the assessment shows that the carrying amount of its insurance liabilities is inadequate in light of the estimated 
future cash flows, the entire deficiency is recognized in profit or loss and reserved as insurance liabilities. Future cash flows from long-term insurance 
are discounted at a future rate of return on operating assets, whereas future cash flows from general insurance are not discounted to present value. For 
liability adequacy tests of premium and unearned premium reserves, the Group considers all cash flow factors such as future insurance premium, deferred 
acquisition costs, operating expenses and operating premiums. In relation to the reserve for outstanding claims, the Group elects a model that best reflects 
the trend of paid claims among several statistical methods to perform the adequacy test.3.16.4 Deferred acquisition costsAcquisition cost is deferred in an amount actually spent for an insurance contract and equally amortized over the premium payment period or the period 
in which acquisition costs are charged for the relevant insurance contract. Acquisition costs are amortized over the shorter of seven years or premium 
payment period; if there is any unamortized acquisition costs remaining as of the date of surrender or lapse, such remainder shall be amortized in the period 
in which the contract is surrendered or lapsed.3.17 ProvisionsProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The 
risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching the best estimate of provisions, and 
where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of provisions are the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to 
settle the obligation.Provisions on confirmed and unconfirmed acceptances and guarantees, unfunded commitments of credit cards and unused credit lines of consumer and 
corporate loans are recognized using a valuation model that applies the credit conversion factor, probability of default, and loss given default.Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provisions are reversed.081If the Group has a contract that is onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognized and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is 
a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under 
it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the minimum net cost to exit from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any 
compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfill it.3.18 Financial Guarantee ContractsA financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer (the Group) to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs 
because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.Financial guarantee contracts are initially recognized at fair value. After initial recognition, financial guarantee contracts are measured at the higher of:–The amount determined in accordance with Korean IFRS 1037, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and
–The initial amount recognized, less, when appropriate, cumulative amortization recognized in accordance with Korean IFRS 1018, Revenue.3.19 Equity Instruments issued by the GroupAn equity instrument is any contract or agreement that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.3.19.1 Ordinary sharesOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from the equity.3.19.2 Treasury sharesIf entities of the Group acquire the Parent Company’s equity instruments, those instruments (‘treasury shares’) are deducted from equity. No gains or losses 
are recognized in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own equity instruments.3.20 Revenue Recognition3.20.1 Interest income and expenseInterest income and expense are recognized using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized 
cost of a financial asset or a financial liability (or groups of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest expense 
over the relevant period.The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument 
or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, 
the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider future credit losses. The calculation 
includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all 
other premiums or discounts. In those rare cases when it is not possible to estimate reliably the cash flows or the expected life of a financial instrument (or 
group of financial instruments), the Group uses the contractual cash flows over the full contractual term of the financial instrument (or group of financial 
instruments).Interest on impaired financial assets is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the 
impairment loss.0823.20.2 Fee and commission incomeThe Group recognizes financial service fees in accordance with the accounting standard of the financial instrument related to the fees earned.Fees that are an integral part of the effective interest of a financial instrument
Such fees are generally treated as adjustments of effective interest. Such fees may include compensation for activities such as evaluating the borrower’s 
financial condition, evaluating and recording guarantees, collateral and other security arrangements, negotiating the terms of the instrument, preparing and 
processing documents and closing the transaction and origination fees received on issuing financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. However, fees 
relating to the creation or acquisition of a financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss are recognized as revenue immediately.Fees earned as services are provided
Such fees are recognized as revenue as the services are provided. The fees include fees charged for servicing a financial instrument and charged for 
managing investments.Fees that are earned on the execution of a significant act
Such fees are recognized as revenue when the significant act has been completed.Commission on the allotment of shares to a client is recognized as revenue when the shares have been allotted and placement fees for arranging a loan 
between a borrower and an investor is recognized as revenue when the loan has been arranged.A syndication fee received by the Group that arranges a loan and retains no part of the loan package for itself (or retains a part at the same effective 
interest rate for comparable risk as other participants) is compensation for the service of syndication. Such a fee is recognized as revenue when the 
syndication has been completed.3.20.3 Dividend incomeDividend income is recognized in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established. Dividend income from financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss and financial investment is recognized in profit or loss as part of net gains on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and other 
operating income and expenses, respectively.3.21 Employee Compensation and Benefits3.21.1 Post-employment benefitsDefined benefit plans
All post-employment benefits, other than defined contribution plans, are classified as defined benefit plans. The amount recognized as a defined benefit 
liability is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the end of the reporting period.The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit method. The rate used 
to discount post-employment benefit obligations is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate 
bonds. The currency and term of the corporate bonds are consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment benefit obligations. 
Actuarial gains and losses including experience adjustments and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in other comprehensive 
income.When the total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation minus the fair value of plan assets results in an asset, it is recognized to the extent of 
the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation, which arises when the Group introduces a defined benefit plan or 
changes the benefits of an existing defined benefit plan. Such past service cost is immediately recognized as an expense for the year.Defined contribution plans
The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due.0833.21.2 Short-term employee benefitsShort-term employee benefits are employee benefits (other than termination benefits) that are due to be settled within 12 months after the end of the 
period in which the employees render the related service. The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for 
that service is recognized as a liability (accrued expense), after deducting any amount already paid.The expected cost of profit-sharing and bonus payments are recognized as liabilities when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to make 
such payments as a result of past events rendered by employees and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.3.21.3 Share-based paymentThe Group has share option and share grant programs to directors and employees of the Group. When the options are exercised, the Group can either 
select to issue new shares or distribute treasury shares, or compensate the difference in fair value of shares and exercise price.
 
For a share-based payment transaction in which the terms of the arrangement provide the Group with the choice of whether to settle in cash or by issuing 
equity instruments, the Group determines that it has a present obligation to settle in cash because the Group has a past practice and a stated policy of 
settling in cash. Therefore, the Group accounts for the transaction in accordance with the requirements of cash-settled share-based payment transactions.The Group measures the services acquired and the liability incurred at fair value, and the fair value is recognized as expense and accrued expenses over 
the vesting period. Until the liability is settled, the Group remeasures the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting period and at the date of 
settlement, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the year.3.21.4 Termination benefitsTermination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts 
voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group shall recognize a liability and expense for termination benefits at the earlier of the following 
dates: when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group recognizes costs for a restructuring that is within the 
scope of Korean IFRS 1037 and involves the payment of termination benefits. Termination benefits are measured by considering the number of employees 
expected to accept the offer in the case of a voluntary early retirement. Termination benefits over 12 months after the reporting period are discounted to 
present value.3.22 Income Tax ExpensesIncome tax expense comprises current tax expense and deferred income tax expense. Current and deferred income tax are recognized as income or 
expense for the period, except to the extent that the tax arises from (a) a transaction or an event which is recognized, in the same or a different period 
outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and (b) a business combination.3.22.1 Current income taxCurrent income tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit (loss) for a period. A difference between the taxable profit and 
accounting profit may arise when income or expense is included in accounting profit in one period, but is included in taxable profit in a different period. 
Differences may also arise if there is revenue that is exempt from taxation, or expense that is not deductible in determining taxable profit (loss). Current 
income tax liabilities (assets) for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be paid to (recovered from) the taxation authorities, 
using the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.The Group offsets current income tax assets and current income tax liabilities if, and only if, the Group (a) has a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognized amounts and (b) intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.0843.22.2 Deferred income taxDeferred income tax is recognized, using the asset-liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax based amount of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amount in the financial statements. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. However, deferred income tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition 
of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except for deferred income tax liabilities for 
which the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future.The carrying amount of a deferred income tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The Group reduces the carrying amount of a deferred 
income tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred 
income tax asset to be utilized.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is 
settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred 
income tax liabilities and deferred income tax assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the 
end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.The Group offsets deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current income tax 
assets against current income tax liabilities; and the deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity; or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current income tax liabilities and assets 
on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred income tax 
liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.3.22.3 Uncertain tax positionsUncertain tax positions arise from tax treatments applied by the Group which may be challenged by the tax authorities due to the complexity of the 
transaction or different interpretation of the tax laws, a claim for rectification brought by the Group, or an appeal for a refund claimed from the tax 
authorities related to additional assessments. The Group recognizes its uncertain tax positions in the consolidated financial statements based on the 
guidance in Korean IFRS 1012. The income tax asset is recognized if a tax refund is probable for taxes paid and levied by the tax authority. However, interest 
and penalties related to income tax are recognized in accordance with Korean IFRS 1037.3.23 Earnings per ShareThe Group calculates basic earnings per share amounts and diluted earnings per share amounts for profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders 
of the Parent Company and presents them in the statement of comprehensive income. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit or loss 
attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. For the 
purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the Group adjusts profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Parent Company and the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares including convertible bonds and share options.3.24 Operating SegmentsOperating segments are components of the Group where separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the chief operating 
decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.Segment information includes items which are directly attributable and reasonably allocated to the segment.0854. Financial Risk Management4.1 Summary4.1.1 Overview of Financial Risk Management PolicyThe financial risks that the Group is exposed to are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and others.The Group’s risk management system focuses on increasing transparency, developing the risk management environment, preventing transmission of risk to 
other related subsidiaries, and the preemptive response to risk due to rapid changes in the financial environment to support the Group’s long-term strategy 
and business decisions efficiently. Credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk have been recognized as the Group’s key risks. These risks are 
measured and managed in Economic Capital or VaR (Value at Risk) using a statistical method.4.1.2 Risk Management OrganizationRisk Management Committee
The Risk Management Committee establishes risk management strategies in accordance with the directives of the Board of Directors and determines 
the Group’s target risk appetite. The Committee approves significant risk matters and reviews the level of risks that the Group is exposed to and the 
appropriateness of the Group’s risk management operations as an ultimate decision-making authority.Risk Management Council
The Risk Management Council is a consultative group which reviews and makes decisions on matters delegated by the Risk Management Committee, and 
discusses the detailed issues relating to the Group’s risk management.Risk Management Division
The Risk Management Division is responsible for monitoring and managing the Group’s economic capital limit and managing detailed policies, procedures 
and working processes relating to the Group’s risk management.4.2 Credit Risk4.2.1 Overview of Credit RiskCredit risk is the risk of possible losses in an asset portfolio in the event of a counterparty’s default, breach of contract and deterioration in the credit quality 
of the counterparty. For risk management reporting purposes, the individual borrower’s default risk, country risk, specific risks and other credit risk exposure 
components are considered as a whole.4.2.2 Credit Risk ManagementThe Group measures expected losses and economic capital on assets that are subject to credit risk management whether on- or off-balance sheet items 
and uses expected losses and economic capital as a management indicator. The Group manages credit risk by allocating credit risk economic capital limits.In addition, the Group controls the credit concentration risk exposure by applying and managing total exposure limits to prevent an excessive risk 
concentration to each industry and borrower.The Group has organized a credit risk management team that focuses on credit risk management in accordance with the Group’s credit risk management 
policy. Especially, the loan analysis department of Kookmin Bank, one of the subsidiaries, is responsible for loan policy, loan limit, loan review, credit 
management, restructuring and subsequent event management, independently of operating department. On the other hand, risk management group of086Kookmin Bank is responsible for planning risk management policy, applying limits of credit lines, measuring the credit risk economic capital, adjusting credit 
limits, reviewing credit and verifying credit evaluation models.4.2.3 Maximum Exposure to Credit RiskThe Group’s maximum exposures of financial instruments, excluding equity securities, to credit risk without consideration of collateral values as of December 
31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:2017(In millions of Korean won)2016Financial assetsDue from financial institutions

2 Loans and other financial assets are net of allowance.4.2.4 Credit Risk of LoansThe Group maintains an allowance for loan losses associated with credit risk on loans to manage its credit risk.The Group recognizes an impairment loss on loan carried at amortized cost when there is any objective indication of impairment. Impairment loss is defined 
as incurred loss in accordance with Korean IFRS; therefore, a loss that might be occur due to a future event is not recognized in spite of its likelihood. The 
Group measures inherent incurred losses on loans and presents them in the consolidated financial statements through the use of an allowance account 
which is offset against the related loans.087Loans as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are classified as follows:LoansRetailCorporateCredit cardTotal2017(In millions of Korean won)Neither past due nor impaired

\\\095The counterparties to the financial assets under due from financial institutions and financial instruments indexed to the price of gold within financial assets 
held for trading and derivatives are in the financial and insurance industries which have high credit ratings.4.3 Liquidity Risk4.3.1 Overview of Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is a risk that the Group becomes insolvency due to uncertain liquidity caused by unexpected cash outflows, or a risk of borrowing high interest 
debts or disposal of liquid and other assets at a substantial discount. The Group manages its liquidity risk through analysis of the contractual maturity of 
interest-bearing assets and liabilities, assets and liabilities related to the other cash flow, and off-balance sheet items related to cash flow of currency 
derivative instruments and others.Cash flows disclosed for the maturity analysis are undiscounted contractual principal and interest to be received (paid) and; thus, are not identical to the 
amount in the financial statements that are based on the present value of expected cash flows in some cases. The amount of interest to be received or paid 
on floating rate assets and liabilities is measured on the assumption that the current interest rate would be the same through the maturity.4.3.2. Liquidity Risk Management and IndicatorThe liquidity risk is managed by risk management policy and liquidity risk management guidelines which are applied to the risk management policies and 
procedures that address all the possible risks that arise from the overall business of the Group.The Group computes and manages cumulative liquidity gap and liquidity rate subject to every transactions that affect cash flow in Korean won and foreign 
currencies and off-balance sheet transactions in relation to the liquidity. The Group regularly reports to the Risk Planning Council and Risk Management 
Committee.4.3.3. Analysis of Remaining Contractual Maturity of Financial Assets and LiabilitiesCash flows disclosed below are undiscounted contractual principal and interest to be received (paid) and; thus, are not identical to the amount in the 
consolidated financial statements that are based on the present value of expected cash flows. The amount of interest to be received or paid on floating rate 
assets and liabilities is measured on the assumption that the current interest rate would be the same through the maturity.
The remaining contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities, excluding derivatives held for cash flow hedging, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016,

2  Financial assets/liabilities held for trading, financial assets/liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss and derivatives held for trading are not managed by contractual 
maturity because they are expected to be traded or redeemed before maturity. Therefore, the carrying amounts of those financial instruments are classified as ‘On demand’

Market risk is the risk of possible losses which arise from changes in market factors; such as, interest rate, stock price, foreign exchange rate and other 
market factors that affect the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments; such as, securities and derivatives amongst others. The most significant 
risks associated with trading positions are interest rate risks, currency risks and also, stock price risks. In addition, the Group is exposed to interest rate risks 
associated with non-trading positions. The Group classifies exposures to market risk into either trading or non-trading positions. The Group measures and 
manages market risk separately for each subsidiary.
 
Risk Management
The Group sets internal capital limits for market risk and interest rate risk and monitors the risks to manage the risk of trading and non-trading positions. The 
Group maintains risk management systems and procedures; such as, trading policies and procedures, and market risk management guidelines for trading 
positions, and interest rate risk management guidelines for non-trading positions in order to manage market risk efficiently. The procedures mentioned are 
implemented with approval from the Risk Management Committee and Risk Management Council.Kookmin Bank, one of the subsidiaries, establishes market risk management policy, sets position limits, loss limits and VaR limits of each business group and 
approves newly developed instruments through its Risk Management Council. The Market Risk Management Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Risk 
Officer (CRO), is the decision maker and sets position limits, loss limits, VaR limits, sensitivity limits and scenario loss limits for each division, at the level of 
each individual business department.The ALCO of Kookmin Bank determines the operational standards of interest and commission, the details of the establishment and prosecution of the Asset 
Liability Management (ALM) policies and enacts and amends relevant guidelines. The Risk Management Committee and Risk Management Council monitor 
the establishment and enforcement of ALM risk management policies, and enact and amend ALM risk management guidelines. The interest rate risk limit is 
set based on the future assets/liabilities position and interest rate volatility estimation reflects the annual work plan. The Financial Planning Department and 
Risk Management Department measures and monitors the interest risk status and limits on a regular basis. The status and limits of interest rate risks; such 
as, interest gap, duration gap and interest rate VaR (Value at Risk), are reported to the ALCO and Risk Management Council on a monthly basis and to the 
Risk Management Committee on a quarterly basis. To ensure adequacy of interest rate and liquidity risk management, the Risk Management Department 
assigns the limits, monitors and reviews the risk management procedures and tasks conducted by the Financial Planning Department. Also, the Risk 
Management Department independently reports related information to the management.0994.4.2 Trading PositionDefinition of a trading position
Trading positions subject to market risk management are defined under the Trading Policy and Guideline, and the basic requirements are as follows:– The trading position is not restricted for sale, is measured daily at fair value, and its significant inherent risks are able to be hedged in the market.
–  The criteria for classification as a trading position are clearly defined in the Trading Policy and Guideline, and separately managed by the trading 
department.
– The trading position is operated in accordance with the documented trading strategy and managed through position limits.
–  The operating department or professional dealers have an authority to enforce a deal on the trading position within predetermined limits without pre-
approval.
– The trading position is reported periodically to management for the purpose of the Group’s risk managementObservation method on market risk arising from trading positions
Subsidiaries of the Group calculate VaR to measure the market risk by using market risk management systems on the entire trading portfolio. Generally, the 
Group manages market risk on the trading portfolio. In addition, the Group controls and manages the risk of derivative trading based on the regulations and 
guidelines formulated by the Financial Supervisory Service.VaR (Value at Risk)
 
i. VaR (Value at Risk)Kookmin Bank, one of the subsidiaries, uses the value-at-risk methodology to measure the market risk of trading positions. Kookmin Bank uses the 10-
day VaR, which estimates the maximum amount of loss that could occur in ten days under an historical simulation model which is considered to be a full 
valuation method. The distributions of portfolio’s value changes are estimated based on the data over the previous 250 business days, and ten-day VaR is 
calculated by subtracting net present market value from the value measured at a 99% confident level of portfolio’s value distribution results.VaR is a commonly used market risk measurement technique. However, the method has some shortcomings. VaR estimates possible losses over a certain 
period at a particular confidence level using past market movement data. Past market movements are, however, not necessarily a good indicator of future 
events, as there may be conditions and circumstances in the future that the model does not anticipate. As a result, the timing and magnitude of the actual 
losses may vary depending on the assumptions made at the time of the calculation. In addition, the time periods used for the model, generally one or ten 
days, are assumed to be a sufficient holding period before liquidating the relevant underlying positions. If these holding periods are not sufficient, or too 
long, the VaR results may understate or overstate the potential loss.A subsidiary which hold trading positions uses an internal model (VaR) to measure general risk, and a standard method to measure each individual risk. 
When the internal model is not permitted for certain market risk, the Group uses the standard method. Therefore, the market risk VaR may not reflect the 
market risk of each individual risk and some specific positions. And also, from this year, non-banking subsidiaries use the same standard method applied to 
measure regulatory capital for improvement of market risk VaR management utility (improvement of relation with regulatory capital).ii. Back-TestingBack-testing is conducted on a daily basis to validate the adequacy of the market risk model. In back-testing, the Group compares both the actual and 
hypothetical profit and loss with the VaR calculations.iii. Stress TestingStress testing is carried out to analyze the impact of abnormal market situations on the trading and available-for-sale portfolio. It reflects changes in interest 
rates, stock prices, foreign exchange rates, implied volatilities of derivatives and other risk factors that have significant influence on the value of the portfolio. The 
Group uses historical scenarios and hypothetical scenarios for the analysis of abnormal market situations. Stress testing is performed at least once every year.100VaR at a 99% confidence level of interest rate, stock price and foreign exchange rate risk for trading positions with a ten-day holding period by a subsidiary 
as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:Kookmin BankInterest rate risk

\\\\\\\102Details of risk factorsi. Interest rate riskTrading position interest rate risk usually arises from debt securities denominated in Korean won. The Group’s trading strategy is to benefit from short-term 
movements in the prices of debt securities arising from changes in interest rates. The Group manages interest rate risk on trading positions using market 
value-based tools such as VaR and sensitivity analysis (Price Value of a Basis Point: PVBP).ii. Stock price riskStock price risk only arises from trading securities denominated in Korean won as the Group does not have any trading exposure to shares denominated in 
foreign currencies. The trading securities portfolio in Korean won are composed of exchange-traded stocks and derivative instruments linked to stock with 
strict limits on diversification.iii. Foreign exchange rate riskForeign exchange rate risk arises from holding assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency and foreign currency derivatives. Net foreign currency 
exposure mostly occurs from the foreign assets and liabilities which are denominated in US dollars and Chinese Yuan. The Group sets both loss limits and net 
foreign currency exposure limits and manages comprehensive net foreign exchange exposures which consider both trading and non-trading portfolios.4.4.3 Non-trading positionDefinition of non-trading position
Managed interest rate risk in non-trading position includes on- or off-balance sheet assets, liabilities and derivatives that are sensitive to interest rate, 
except trading position for market risk. The interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are interest-bearing assets and liabilities that create interest income 
and expenses.
 
Observation method on market risk arising from non-trading position
Interest rate risk occurs due to mismatches on maturities and interest rate reset periods between interest-bearing assets and liabilities. The Group manages 
the risk through measuring and managing interest rate VaR and EaR that are maximum expected decreases in net asset value (NPV) and net interest income 
(NII) for one year, respectively, arising from unfavorable changes in market interest rate.Interest Rate VaR
Interest rate VaR is the maximum possible loss due to interest rate risk under a normal distribution at a 99.9% confidence level. The measurement results of 
risk as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:Kookmin Bank

effect on capital.4.5.2 Risk ManagementThe purpose of operational risk management is not only to comply with supervisory and regulatory requirements but also to promote a risk management 
culture, strengthen internal controls, innovate processes and provide timely feedback to management and employees. In addition, Kookmin Bank established 
Business Continuity Plans (BCP) to ensure critical business functions can be maintained, or restored, in the event of material disruptions arising from internal 
or external events. It has constructed replacement facilities as well as has carried out exercise drills for head office and IT departments to test its BCPs.4.6. Capital AdequacyThe Group complies with the capital adequacy standard established by the Financial Services Commission. The capital adequacy standard is based on Basel 
III published by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Bank of International Settlements in June 2011, and was implemented in Korea in December 
2013. The Group is required to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 6.25%(2016: 5.375%), a minimum Tier 1 ratio of 7.75%(2016: 
6.875%) and a minimum Total Regulatory Capital of 9.75%(2016: 8.875%) as of December 31, 2017.105The Group's equity capital is classified into three categories in accordance with the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory Regulations on 
Financial Holding Companies:-  Common Equity Tier 1 Capital: Common equity Tier 1 Capital represents the issued capital that takes the first and proportionately greatest share of any  
 losses and represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the Group, and not repaid outside of liquidation. It includes common shares issued,  
 capital surplus, retained earnings, non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, accumulated other comprehensive income, other capital surplus  
 and others.-  Additional Tier 1 Capital: Additional Tier 1 Capital includes (i) perpetual instruments issued by the Group that meet the criteria for inclusion in Additional  
 Tier 1 capital, and (ii) stock surplus resulting from the issue of instruments included in Additional Tier 1 capital and others.-  Tier 2 Capital: Tier 2 Capital represents the capital that takes the proportionate share of losses in the liquidation of the Group. Tier 2 Capital includes a  
 fund raised by issuing subordinated debentures maturing in not less than five years that meet the criteria for inclusion in Additional Tier 2 capital, and  
 the allowance for loan losses which are accumulated for assets classified as normal or precautionary as a result of classification of asset soundness in  
 accordance with Regulation on Supervision of Financial Holding Companies and others.Risk weighted asset means the inherent risks in the total assets held by the Group. The Group calculates risk weighted asset by each risk (credit risk, market 
risk, and operational risk) based on the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory Regulations on Financial Holding Companies and uses it for BIS 
ratio calculation.The Group assesses and monitors its adequacy of capital by using the internal assessment and management policy of the capital adequacy. The assessment 
of the capital adequacy is conducted by comparing available capital (actual amount of available capital) and internal capital (amount of capital enough 
to cover all significant risks under target credit rate set by the Group). The Group monitors the soundness of finance and provides risk adjusted basis for 
performance review using the assessment of the capital adequacy.Internal Capital is the amount of capital to prevent the inability of payment due to unexpected loss in the future. The Group measures, allocates and 
monitors internal capital by risk type and subsidiaries.The Risk Management Council of the Group determines the Group’s risk appetite and allocates internal capital by risk type and subsidiary. Each subsidiary 
efficiently operates its capital within a range of allocated internal capital. The Risk Management Department of the Group monitors the limit on internal 
capital and reports the results to management and the Risk Management Council. The Group maintains the adequacy of capital through proactive review 
and approval of the Risk Management Committee when the internal capital is expected to exceed the limits due to new business or business expansion.Details of the Group's capital adequacy calculation in line with Basel III requirements as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:Equity Capital:Tier 1 CapitalCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital

334,101,978The fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants. For each class of financial assets and financial liabilities, the Group discloses the fair value of that class of assets and liabilities in a way that 
permits it to be compared with its carrying amount at the end of each reporting period. The best evidence of fair value of financial instruments is a quoted 
price in an active market.Methods of determining fair value for financial instruments are as follows:111Cash and due from 
financial institutionsThe carrying amounts of cash and demand due from financial institutions and payment due from financial institutions are a 
reasonable approximation of fair values. These financial instruments do not have a fixed maturity and are receivable on demand. 
Fair value of ordinary due from financial institutions is measured using DCF model (Discounted Cash Flow Model).Investment securitiesThe fair value of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets is determined using the quoted prices. Fair value is 
determined through the use of external professional valuation institution where quoted prices are not available. The institutions use 
one or more of the following valuation techniques including DCF Model, Free Cash Flow to Equity Model, Comparable Company 
Analysis, Dividend Discount Model, Risk Adjusted Discount Rate Method, and Net Asset Value Method.LoansDCF model is used to determine the fair value of loans. Fair value is determined by discounting the expected cash flows, which are 
contractual cash flows adjusted by the expected prepayment rate, at appropriate discount rate.Derivatives and 
Financial assets at fair 
value through profit 
or lossDepositsDebtsFor exchange traded derivatives, quoted price in an active market is used to determine fair value and for OTC derivatives, fair value 
is determined using valuation techniques. The Group uses internally developed valuation models that are widely used by market 
participants to determine fair values of plain vanilla OTC derivatives including options, interest rate swaps, and currency swaps, based 
on observable market parameters. However, some complex financial instruments are valued using appropriate models developed 
from generally accepted market valuation models including the Finite Difference Method, the Monte Carlo Simulation, Black-
Scholes Model, Hull and White Model, Closed Form and Tree Model or valuation results from independent external professional 
valuation institution.Carrying amount of demand deposits is regarded as representative of fair value because they do not have a fixed maturity and 
are payable on demand. Fair value of time deposits is determined using a DCF model. Fair value is determined by discounting the 
expected cash flows, which are contractual cash flows adjusted by the expected prepayment rate, at an appropriate discount rate.Carrying amount of overdraft in foreign currency is regarded as representative of fair value because they do not have a fixed 
maturity and are payable on demand. Fair value of other debts is determined using a DCF model discounting contractual future 
cash flows at an appropriate discount rate.DebenturesFair value is determined by using the valuations of external professional valuation institution, which are calculated using market 
inputs.Other financial assets 
and liabilitiesThe carrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair values. These financial instruments are temporary accounts used for 
other various transactions and their maturities are relatively short or not defined. However, fair value of finance lease liabilities is 
measured using a DCF model.Fair value hierarchy
The Group believes that valuation methods used for measuring the fair values of financial instruments are reasonable and that the fair values recognized in 
the statements of financial position are appropriate. However, the fair values of the financial instruments recognized in the statements of financial position 
may be different if other valuation methods or assumptions are used. Additionally, as there is a variety of valuation techniques and assumptions used in 
measuring fair value, it may be difficult to reasonably compare the fair value with that of other financial institutions.The Group classifies and discloses fair value of the financial instruments into the three-level hierarchy as follows:Level 1: The fair values are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date.Level 2: The fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or 
indirectly.Level 3: The fair values are based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety shall be determined on the basis of the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value 
measurement in its entirety. If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that 
measurement is a Level 3 measurement.112Fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statements of financial position
The fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statements of financial position as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, is

 15,929,9641  The amounts of equity securities carried at cost in “Level 3”, which do not have a quoted market price in an active market and cannot be measured reliably at fair value, are \ 116,629 
million and \ 223,398 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These equity securities are carried at cost because it is practically difficult to quantify the intrinsic 
values of the equity securities issued by unlisted public and non-profit entities. In addition, due to significant fluctuations in estimated cash flows arising from entities being in its initial 
stages, which further results in varying and unpredictable probabilities, unlisted equity securities issued by project financing cannot be reliably and reasonably assessed. Therefore, 
these equity securities are carried at cost. The Group has no plan to sell these instruments in the near future.Valuation techniques and the inputs used in the fair value measurement classified as Level 2

reporting period.Where a reclassification between the levels of the fair value hierarchy occurs for a financial asset or liability, the Group’s policy is to recognize such transfers 
as having occurred at the beginning of the reporting period.6.2.2 Changes in Fair Value (Level 3) Measured Using Valuation Technique Based on Unobservable in MarketDetails of changes in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:117(In millions of Korean won)Financial assets at

Sensitivity analysis of financial instruments is performed to measure favorable and unfavorable changes in the fair value of financial instruments which are 
affected by the unobservable parameters, using a statistical technique. When the fair value is affected by more than two input parameters, the amounts 
represent the most favorable or most unfavorable. Level 3 financial instruments subject to sensitivity analysis are equity-related derivatives, currency-
related derivatives and interest rate-related derivatives whose fair value changes are recognized in profit or loss as well as debt securities and unlisted equity 
securities (including private equity funds) whose fair value changes are recognized in profit or loss or other comprehensive income.The results of the sensitivity analysis from changes in inputs are as follows:(In millions of Korean won)2017Recognition in profit or lossFavorable

     -1  For financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss, the changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters such Volatility of the 
underlying asset or Correlation between underlying asset by ± 10%.
2  For stock and index-related derivatives, the changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters such as the correlation of rates of return on stocks 
and the volatility of the underlying asset by ± 10%. For currency-related derivatives, the changes in fair value are calculated by shifting the unobservable input parameters, such as 
the loss given default ratio by ± 1%. For interest rate-related derivatives, the correlation of the interest rates or the volatility of the underlying asset is shifted by ± 10% to calculate 
the fair value changes. 
3 For debt securities, the changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters; such as, discount rate by ± 1%.
4  For equity securities, the changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters such as correlation between growth rate (0~0.5%) and discount rate, 
liquidation value (-1~1%) and discount rate, or recovery rate of receivables' acquisition cost (-1~1%). Sensitivity of fair values to unobservable parameters of private equity fund is 
practically impossible, but in the case of equity fund composed of real estates, the changes in fair value are calculated by shifting correlation between discount rate (-1~1%) and 
volatilities of real estate price (-1~1%).6.2.4 Day One Gain or LossIf the Group uses a valuation technique that incorporates data not obtained from observable markets for the fair value at initial recognition of financial 
instruments, there could be a difference between the transaction price and the amount determined using that valuation technique. In these circumstances, 
the fair value of financial instruments is recognized as the transaction price, and the difference is deferred and not recognized in profit or loss, and is 
amortized by using the straight-line method over the life of the financial instrument. When the fair value of the financial instruments is subsequently 
determined using observable market inputs, the remaining deferred amount is recognized in profit or loss.124The aggregate difference yet to be recognized in profit or loss at the beginning and end of the period and a reconciliation of changes in the balance of this 
difference for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:Balance at the beginning of the period

  856,6021  The Company has an obligation to early redeem the asset-backed debentures upon occurrence of an event specified in the agreement such as when the outstanding balance of 
the eligible asset-backed securitization (ABS), a trust-type ABS, is below the solvency margin ratio(minimum rate: 104.5%) of the beneficiary interest in the trust. In addition, the 
Company can entrust additional eligible card transaction accounts and deposits. To avoid such early redemption, the Company entrusts accounts and deposits in addition to the 
previously entrusted card accounts. Accordingly, as asset-backed debenture holders’ recourse is not limited to the underlying assets, the fair value is not disclosed.
2  According to the liquidity facility agreement entered between the Special Purpose Companies (SPC) and Woori Bank and NH Bank, if the senior debentures cannot be redeemed by 
the underlying assets, the senior debentures should be redeemed by borrowings from the liquidity facilities. Accordingly, as senior debenture holders’ recourse is not limited to the 
underlying assets, the fair value is not disclosed.Securities under repurchase agreements and loaned securities
The Group continues to recognize the financial assets related to repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions on the statements of financial 
position since those transactions are not qualified for derecognition even though the Group transfers the financial assets. A financial asset is sold under 
a repurchase agreement to repurchase the same asset at a fixed price, or loaned under a securities lending agreement to be returned as the same asset. 
Thus, the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. The amounts of transferred assets and related liabilities as 
of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:(In millions of Korean won)2017Carrying amount of transferred assetsCarrying amount of related liabilitiesRepurchase agreements

derivative and spot exchange counterparties. Similar netting agreements are also entered into with the Group’s reverse repurchase, securities and others. 
Pursuant to these agreements, in the event of default by one party, contracts are to be terminated and receivables and payables are to be offset. Further, 
as the law allows for the right to offset, domestic uncollected receivables balances and domestic accrued liabilities balances are shown in its net settlement 
balance in the consolidated statement of financial position.Details of financial assets subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreement as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as

2 Goodwill occurred from a business combination during 2017 has not been tested for impairment.157Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units, based on management’s analysis, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 
for impairment testing, and cash-generating units consist of an operating segment or units which are not larger than an operating segment. The Group 
recognized the amount of \ 65,288 million related to goodwill acquired in the merger of Housing & Commercial Bank. Of those respective amounts, the 
amounts of \ 49,315 million and \ 15,973 million were allocated to the Retail Banking and Corporate Banking, respectively. Cash-generating units to 
which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the unit may be impaired, by comparing the 
carrying amount of the unit, including the goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the unit.The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is measured at the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The fair value less costs to 
sell is the amount obtainable from the sale in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of disposal. If it is difficult to 
measure the amount obtainable from the sale, the Group measures the fair value less costs to sell by reflecting the characteristics of the measured cash-
generating unit. If it is not possible to obtain reliable information to measure the fair value less costs to sell, the Group uses the asset’s value in use as its 
recoverable amount. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit. The projections 
of the future cash flows are based on the most recent financial budget approved by management and generally cover a period of five years. The future 
cash flows after projection period are estimated on the assumption that the future cash flows will increase by 1.0% for all other cash-generating units. The 
key assumptions used for the estimation of the future cash flows are the market size and the Group’s market share. The discount rate is a pre-tax rate that 
reflects assumptions regarding risk-free interest rate, market risk premium and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have 
not been adjusted.Details of intangible assets, excluding goodwill, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:(In millions of Korean won)2017Accumulated

Net Defined Benefit Liabilities (Assets)Defined benefit planThe Group operates defined benefit plans which have the following characteristics:- The Group has the obligation to pay the agreed benefits to all its current and former employees.
- Actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more than expected) and investment risk fall, in substance, on the Group.The defined benefit liability recognized in the statements of financial position is calculated by independent actuaries in accordance with actuarial valuation 
methods.The net defined benefit obligation is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit method (the ‘PUC’). Data used in the PUC such as interest rates, future salary 
increase rate, mortality rate and consumer price index are based on observable market data and historical data which are updated annually.Actuarial assumptions may differ from actual results, due to changes in the market, economic trends and mortality trends which may impact defined benefit 
liabilities and future payments. Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in the period incurred through other 
comprehensive income.Changes in the net defined benefit liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:2017(In millions of Korean won)Present value of defined benefitobligationFair value of plan assetsNet defined benefit liabilitiesBeginning

(117,803)37.5 Insurance Premiums and Reinsurance37.5.1 OverviewInsurance risk is the risk that arises from a primary operation of insurance companies that is associated with acceptance of insurance contract and payment 
of claims, and is classified as the insurance price risk and the reserves risk. The insurance price risk is the risk of loss that might occur when the actual risk 
exceeds the expected risk rate or expected insurance operating expenses ratios in calculation of premiums. It is the risk of loss that arises from differences 
between actual payment of claims and premiums received from policyholders. The reserves risk is the risk that arises due to a deficit in reserves at the date 
of assessment, making the Group unable to cover the actual claims payment in the future.19837.5.2 Purposes, policies and procedures to manage risk arising from insurance contractsThe risks associated with insurance contract that the Group faces are the insurance actuarial risk and the acceptance risk. Each risk occurs due to insurance 
contract’s pricing and conditions of acceptance. In order to minimize acceptance risk, the Group establishes guidelines and procedure for acceptance and 
out lines specific conditions for acceptance by product. In addition, expected risk level at the date of pricing is compared with actual risk of contracts after 
acceptance and the interest rate is adjusted accordingly, conditions of sale is changed, sale of goods is interrupted and other measures are taken in order 
to reduce insurance actuarial risk. The Group has a committee to discuss status of product acceptance risk and interest rate policy. The committee decides 
important matters to set the processes that allow minimizing the insurance actuarial risk, the acceptance risk and other business related risk.In addition, according to reinsurance operating standards, the Group establishes an operating strategy of reinsurance for large claims expense due to 
unexpected catastrophic events. The Group supports so that policyholders are safe and the Group’s stable profit can be achieved. For the long-term goal, 
the Group manages risk at a comprehensive level to keep its value at the maximum.The Group’s entire risk is calculated by using RBC method. The Group sets the risk appetite limits in order that the calculated risk level is maintained at an 
appropriate level compared to available capital. Portfolio of assets and products are monitored to improve profit compared to risk.37.5.3 Exposure to insurance price riskAccording to RBC standard, exposure to insurance price risk is defined as net written premiums for prior 1 year that is calculated by adding and subtracting 
original insurance premium, assumed reinsurance premium and ceded reinsurance premium.The Group’s exposure to insurance price risk as of December 31, 2017 as follows:2017(In millions of Korean won)Direct insuranceInward reinsuranceOutward reinsuranceTotal\\906,603 \2,000,232

insurances (for private use, for hire, for business, bicycle and other), long-term insurances (long-term non-life, property damage, injury, driver, savings, 
illness, nursing and pension) and various other insurances. The Group’s risk is distributed through reinsurance, joint acceptance and diversified selling. In 
addition, insurances that cover serious damage of risk, although with rare possibility of the occurrence of disaster, such as storm and flood insurance are 
limited, and the Group controls the risk through joint acquisition.Loss development tablesThe Group uses claim development of payments and the estimated ultimate claims for the accident years in order to maintain overall reserve adequacy 
in respect of general, automobile and long-term insurance. When the estimated ultimate claims are greater than claim payments, the Group establishes 
additional reserves. Loss development tables as of December 31, 2017, are as follows:199\General InsuranceAccident yearEstimate of gross ultimate claims (A)

changes in interest rates and it is managed to minimize the loss experienced. For long-term, non-life insurance contracts, the Group calculates exposure 
of interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Liabilities exposure is premium reserves after subtracting costs of termination deductions. Asset 
exposure is interest-bearing assets. Assets that receive only fees without interest are excluded from interest bearing assets. Exposures to interest rate risk as 
of December 31, 2017 are as follows:i) Exposure to interest rate riskLiabilitiesFixed interest rate

Duration is used to measure interest rate risk within risk based solvency test. ALM system for risk based solvency test is utilized to manage interest rate risk 
internally. In addition, Risk Management Committee sets ALM strategy every year to manage interest rate risk.iii) Sensitivity to changes in interest rates
Generally, when interest rates rise, the value and duration of assets and liabilities fall, when interest rates fall, value and duration of assets and liabilities 
increase. When duration of assets is shorter than duration of liabilities, the interest risk is increased if the interest rates fall since increased asset value is 
smaller than liabilities increase.iv) Negative spread risk control
To control interest expenses from other liabilities and investment incomes from assets, the Group publicizes its interest rate considering market interest rate 
and return on invested insurance assets of the Group.20337.6 Risk management of life insurance37.6.1 OverviewInsurance risk is the risk of loss arising from the actual risk at the time of claims exceeding the estimated risk at the time of underwriting. Insurance risk is 
classified by insurance price risk and policy reserve risk.Insurance price risk is the risk of loss arising from differences between premiums from policyholders and actual claims paid.Policy reserve risk is the risk of loss arising from differences between policy reserves the Group holds and actual claims to be paid.The Group measures only insurance price risk under RBC requirement because life insurance claim payout is mainly in a fixed amount with less volatility in 
policy reserve and shorter waiting period before payment37.6.2 Concentration of insurance risk and reinsurance policyThe Group uses reinsurance to mitigate concentration of insurance risk seeking an enhanced capital management.The Group categorized reinsurance into group and individual contracts, and reinsurance is ceded through the following process:The Group’s reinsurance is ceded through the following process:i. In the decision-making process of launching a new product, the Group makes a decision on ceding reinsurance. Subsequently, a reinsurer is selected 
through bidding, agreements with the relevant departments and final approval by the executive management.ii. The reinsurance department analyzes the object of reinsurance, the maximum limit of reinsurance and the loss ratio with the relevant departments.37.6.3 The characteristic and exposure of insurance price riskThe Group measures the exposure of insurance price risk as the shortfall of the risk premiums received compared to the claims paid on all insurance 
contracts for the last one year preceding the reporting date.The insurance risk of a life insurance company is measured by insurance price risk. As the life insurance coverage is in the form of a fixed payment, the 
fluctuation of policy reserve is small and the period from insured event to claims payment is not long. The policy reserve risk is managed by assessments of 
adequacy of the policy reserve.The insurance price risk is managed through insurance risk management regulation established by Risk Management Committee.The maximum exposures to insurance price risk as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:Death

156,36623445.3 Insurance Risk at the Time of Business Combination45.3.1 OverviewInsurance risk is the risk that arises from a primary operation of insurance companies that is associated with acceptance of insurance contract and payment 
of claims, and is classified as the insurance price risk and the reserves risk. The insurance price risk is the risk of loss that might occur when the actual risk 
exceeds the expected risk rate or expected insurance operating expenses ratios in calculation of premiums. It is the risk of loss that arises from differences 
between actual payment of claims and premiums received from policyholders. The reserves risk is the risk that arises due to a deficit in reserves at the date 
of assessment, making KB Insurance Co., Ltd. unable to cover the actual claims payment in the future.45.3.2 Purposes, policies and procedures to manage risk arising from insurance contractsThe risks associated with insurance contract that KB Insurance Co., Ltd. faces are the insurance actuarial risk and the acceptance risk. Each risk occurs due to 
insurance contract’s pricing and conditions of acceptance. In order to minimize acceptance risk, KB Insurance Co., Ltd. establishes guidelines and procedure 
for acceptance and out lines specific conditions for acceptance by product. In addition, expected risk level at the date of pricing is compared with actual risk 
of contracts after acceptance and the interest rate is adjusted accordingly, conditions of sale is changed, sale of goods is interrupted and other measures 
are taken in order to reduce insurance actuarial risk. KB Insurance Co., Ltd. has a committee to discuss status of product acceptance risk and interest rate 
policy. The committee decides important matters to set the processes that allow minimizing the insurance actuarial risk, the acceptance risk and other 
business related risk.In addition, according to reinsurance operating standards, KB Insurance Co., Ltd. establishes an operating strategy of reinsurance for large claims expense 
due to unexpected catastrophic events. KB Insurance Co., Ltd. supports so that policyholders are safe and KB Insurance Co., Ltd.’s stable profit can be 
achieved. For the long-term goal, KB Insurance Co., Ltd. manages risk at a comprehensive level to keep its value at the maximum.KB Insurance Co., Ltd.’s entire risk is calculated by using RBC method. KB Insurance Co., Ltd. sets the risk appetite limits in order that the calculated risk level 
is maintained at an appropriate level compared to available capital. Portfolio of assets and products are monitored to improve profit compared to risk.45.3.3 Exposure to insurance price riskAccording to RBC standard, exposure to insurance price risk is defined as net written premiums for prior 1 year that is calculated by adding and subtracting 
original insurance premium, assumed reinsurance premium and ceded reinsurance premium.General

Duration is used to measure interest rate risk within risk based solvency test. ALM system for risk based solvency test is utilized to manage interest rate risk 
internally. In addition, Risk Management Committee sets ALM strategy every year to manage interest rate risk.Sensitivity to changes in interest rates
Generally, when interest rates rise, the value and duration of assets and liabilities fall, when interest rates fall, value and duration of assets and liabilities 
increase. When duration of assets is shorter than duration of liabilities, the interest risk is increased if the interest rates fall since increased asset value is 
smaller than liabilities increase.Negative spread risk control
To control interest expenses from other liabilities and investment incomes from assets, KB Insurance Co., Ltd. publicizes its interest rate considering market 
interest rate and return on invested insurance assets of KB Insurance Co., Ltd.239(2) Acquisition of MARITIME SECURITIES INCORPORATIONIn October 9, 2017 the Group acquired 99.40% shares of MARITIME SECURITIES INCORPORATION, which operates in Vietnam securities industry. The

financial performance or cash flows, is not presented in the accompanying separate financial statements.The separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Korean IFRS. These are the standards, subsequent amendments 
and related interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") that have been adopted by the Republic of Korea.The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. Management also needs to exercise judgment in applying 
the Company's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant 
to the separate financial statements are disclosed in Note 2.4.The separate financial statements were prepared in accordance with Korean IFRS 1027, Separate Financial Statements.The Company has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual reporting period commencing January 1, 2017. The 
adoption of these amendments did not have any impact on the current period or any prior period and is not likely to affect future periods.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1007 Statement of Cash Flows246Amendments to Korean IFRS 1007 Statement of Cash flows requires to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in 
liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash flows.(refer to notes 29)- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1012 Income TaxAmendments to Korean IFRS 1012 clarify how to account for deferred tax assets related to debt instruments measured at fair value. Korean IFRS 1012 
provides requirements on the recognition and measurement of current or deferred tax liabilities or assets. The amendments issued clarify the requirements 
on recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses, to address diversity in practice.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1112 Disclosure of Interests in Other EntitiesAmendments to Korean IFRS 1112 clarify when an entity’s interest in a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate is classified as held for sales in accordance 
with Korean IFRS 1105, the entity is required to disclose other information except for summarized financial information in accordance with Korean IFRS 1112.Certain new accounting standards and interpretations that have been published that are not mandatory for annual reporting period commencing January 1, 
2017 and have not been early adopted by the Company are set out below.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1028 Investments in Associates and Joint VenturesWhen an investment in an associate or a joint venture is held by, or it held indirectly through, an entity that is a venture capital organization, or a mutual 
fund, unit trust and similar entities including investment-linked insurance funds, the entity may elect to measure that investment at fair value through profit 
or loss in accordance with Korean IFRS 1109. The amendments clarify that an entity shall make this election separately for each associate of joint venture, 
at initial recognition of the associate or joint venture. The Company will apply these amendments retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the amendments to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial 
statements because the Company is not a venture capital organization.- Amendments to Korean IFRS 1102 Share-based PaymentAmendments to Korean IFRS 1102 clarifies accounting for a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the 
classification of the transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled. Amendments also, clarify that the measurement approach should treat the terms 
and conditions of a cash-settled award in the same way as for an equity-settled award. The amendments will be effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after January 1, 2018 with early application permitted. The Company does not expect the amendments to have a significant impact on the separate 
financial statements.- Enactments to Interpretation IFRIC 2122 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance ConsiderationAccording to these enactments, the date of the transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related 
asset, expense or income (or part of it) is the date on which an entity initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the 
payment or receipt of advance consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the entity shall determine a date of the transaction for 
each payment or receipt of advance consideration. These enactments will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early 
adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the enactments to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.- Korean IFRS 1109 Financial InstrumentsThe new standard for financial instruments issued on September 25, 2015 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 with early 
application permitted. This standard will replace Korean IFRS 1039 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The Company will apply the 
standards for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018.The standard requires retrospective application with some exceptions. For example, an entity is not required to restate prior periods in relation to 
classification, measurement and impairment of financial instruments. The standard requires prospective application of its hedge accounting requirements for 
all hedging relationships except the accounting for time value of options and other exceptions.247Korean IFRS 1109 Financial Instruments requires all financial assets to be classified and measured on the basis of the entity’s business model for managing 
financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. A new impairment model, an expected credit loss model, is introduced 
and any subsequent changes in expected credit losses will be recognized in profit or loss. Also, hedge accounting rules amended to extend the hedging 
relationship, which consists only of eligible hedging instruments and hedged items, qualifies for hedge accounting.An effective implementation of Korean IFRS 1109 requires preparation processes including financial impact assessment, accounting policy establishment, 
accounting system development and the system stabilization. The impact on the Company’s financial statements due to the application of the standard is 
dependent on judgements made in applying the standard, financial instruments held by the Company and macroeconomic variables.Within the Company, Korean IFRS 1109 Task Force Team ('TFT') has been set up to prepare for implementation of Korean IFRS 1109 since October 2015. 
There are three stages for implementation of Korean IFRS, such as analysis, design and implementation, and preparation for application. The Company 
analyzed financial impacts of Korean IFRS 1109 on its separate financial statements.StagePeriodProcess1

Preparation for opening balances of the financial statementsThe Company performed an impact assessment to identify potential financial effects of applying Korean IFRS 1109. The assessment was performed based 
on available information as of December 31, 2017, and the results of the assessment are explained as below. Meanwhile, the following areas are likely to be 
affected in general. The results of the assessment in the financial effects as at December 31, 2017 may change due to additional information and decisions 
that the Company may obtain in the future.(a) Classification and Measurement of Financial AssetsWhen implementing Korean IFRS 1109, the classification of financial assets will be driven by the Company’s business model for managing the financial 
assets and contractual terms of cash flow. The following table shows the classification of financial assets measured subsequently at amortized cost, at fair 
value through other comprehensive income and at fair value through profit or loss. For hybrid (combined) instruments, the Company does not measure an 
embedded derivative separately from its host contract, financial assets with embedded derivatives are classified in their entirety.Business modelSolely represent payments of principal and interestAll otherContractual cash flows characteristicsHold the financial asset for the collection of

through profit or loss²1 A designation at fair value through profit or loss is allowed only if such designation mitigates an accounting mismatch (irrevocable).
2 A designation at fair value through other comprehensive income is allowed only if the financial instrument is the equity investment that is not held for trading (irrevocable).With the implementation of Korean IFRS 1109, the criteria to classify the financial assets at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive 
income are more strictly applied than the criteria applied with Korean IFRS 1039. Accordingly, the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss may 
increase by implementing Korean IFRS 1109 and may result an extended fluctuation in profit or loss.The following table presents the impact of the change in classification and measurement of financial instrument (excluding derivatives) held by the 
Company as at December 31, 2017, using the financial instrument accounting system developed by the Company with applying Korean IFRS 1109.248Classification in accordance withAmount in accordance withKorean IFRS 1039Korean IFRS 1109Korean IFRS 1039Korean IFRS 1109Cash and due from financial institutionsMeasured at amortized cost₩245,400 ₩245,400(In millions of Korean won)Financial assets at fair value through profit or lossFinancial assets designated at fairRecognized at fair value throughvalue through profit and lossprofit or loss1LoansOther assetsMeasured at amortized costMeasured at amortized cost284,48510,00016,207

556,092₩1 The financial assets amounting to \ 284,485 million that was previously classified as financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with Korean IFRS 1039, 
will be reclassified as financial assets recognized at fair value through profit or loss, even if the financial assets are not designated at fair value through profit or loss.(b) Classification and Measurement of Financial LiabilitiesKorean IFRS 1109 requires that the amount of the change of fair value attributable to changes in the credit risk in the financial liabilities designated at fair 
value through profit or loss will be recognized in other comprehensive income, not in profit or loss, unless this treatment of the credit risk component creates 
or enlarges a measurement mismatch. Amounts presented in other comprehensive income are not subsequently transferred to profit or loss.Under Korean IFRS 1039, all financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss recognized their fair value movements in profit or loss. However, 
under Korean IFRS 1109, certain fair value movements will be recognized in other comprehensive income and as a result, profit or loss from fair value 
movements may decrease.There is no financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss as at December 31, 2017. So, there is no impact on the financial statements.(c) Impairment: Financial Assets and Contract AssetsThe new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses (ECL) rather than only incurred credit losses 
as is the case under Korean IFRS 1039. It applies to financial assets classified at amortized cost, debt instruments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, contract assets, lease receivables, loan commitments and certain financial guarantee contracts.Under Korean IFRS 1109 ‘expected loss’ model, a credit event (or impairment ‘trigger’) no longer has to occur before credit losses are recognized. The 
Company will always recognize (at a minimum) 12-month expected credit losses in profit or loss. Lifetime expected losses will be recognized on assets for 
which there is a significant increase in credit risk after initial recognition.StageNo significant increase in credit risk after 
initial recognitionSignificant increase in credit risk after initial 
recognition
Credit-impaired123Loss allowance12-month expected credit losses: expected credit losses that result from those 
default events on the financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the 
reporting dateLifetime expected credit losses: expected credit losses that result from all possible 
default events over the life of the financial instrumentUnder Korean IFRS 1109, the asset that is credit-impaired at initial recognition would recognize all changes in lifetime expected credit losses since the initial 
recognition as a loss allowance.249(d) Hedge AccountingHedge accounting mechanics (fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and hedge of net investments in a foreign operations) required by Korean IFRS 1039 
remains unchanged in Korean IFRS 1109, however, the new hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the 
Company’s risk management practices. As a general rule, more hedge relationships might be eligible for hedge accounting, as the standard introduces a 
more principles-based approach. Korean IFRS 1109 allows more hedging instruments and hedged items to qualify for hedge accounting, and relaxes the 
hedge accounting requirement by removing two hedge effectiveness tests that are a prospective test to ensure that the hedging relationship is expected 
to be highly effective and a quantitative retrospective test (within range of 80-125%) to ensure that the hedging relationship has been highly effective 
throughout the reporting period.With implementation of Korean IFRS 1109, volatility in profit or loss may be reduced as some items that were not eligible as hedged items or hedging 
instruments under Korean IFRS 1039 are now eligible under Korean IFRS 1109.Furthermore, when the Company first applies Korean IFRS 1109, it may choose as its accounting policy choice to continue to apply all of the hedge 
accounting requirements of Korean IFRS 1039 instead of the requirements of Korean IFRS 1109.Meanwhile, as at December 31,2017, the Company has not applied hedge accounting more for the risk management practices which can be applied hedge 
accounting by Korean IFRS 1109 but cannot be satisfied with hedge accounting requirements by Korean IFRS 1039.- Korean IFRS 1115 Revenue from Contracts with CustomersKorean IFRS 1115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers issued on November 6, 2015 replaces Korean IFRS 1018 Revenue, Korean IFRS 1011 
Construction Contracts, Interpretation 2031 Revenue-Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services, Interpretation 2113 Customer Loyalty Programs, 
Interpretation 2115 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate and Interpretation 2118 Transfers of assets from customers.Korean IFRS 1018 and other, the current standard, provide revenue recognition criteria by type of transactions; such as, sales goods, the rendering of 
services, interest income, royalty income, dividend income, and construction contracts. However, Korean IFRS 1115, the new standard is based on the 
principle that revenue is recognized when control of a good or service transfers to a customer – so the notion of control replaces the existing notion of risks 
and rewards. A new five-step process must be applied before revenue from contract with customer can be recognized:- Identify contracts with customers 
- Identify the separate performance obligation 
- Determine the transaction price of the contract 
- Allocate the transaction price to each of the separate performance obligations, and 
- Recognize the revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.The Company will apply new standard for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company 
does not expect the amendments to have a significant impact on the separate financial statements.- Enactment Korean IFRS 1116 LeasesKorean IFRS 1116 Leases issued on May 22, 2017 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. This 
standard will replace Korean IFRS 1017 Leases, Interpretation 2014 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, Interpretation 2015 Operating 
Leases-Incentives, and Interpretation 2027 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.At inception of a contract, the entity shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Also, at the date of initial application, the entity shall assess 
whether the contract is, or contains, a lease in accordance with the standard. However, the entity will not need to reassess all contracts with applying the 
practical expedient because the entity elected to apply the practical expedient only to contracts entered before the date of initial application.For a contract that is, or contains, a lease, the entity shall account for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease 
components of the contract. A lease is required to recognize a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease250liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The lessee may elect not to apply the requirements to short-term lease (a lease term of 12 
months or less at the commencement date) and low value assets (e.g. underlying assets below $ 5,000). In addition, as a practical expedient, the lessee may 
elect, by class of underlying asset, not to separate non-lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any 
associated non-lease components as a single lease component.The classification criteria between a financial lease and an operating lease for a lessor under Korean IFRS 1116 are similar to Korean IFRS 1017.The Company is currently in progress of analyzing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of Korean IFRS 1116.2.2 Measurement BasisThe separate financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified.2.3 Functional and Presentation CurrencyItems included in the separate financial statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Company operates (“the functional currency”). The separate financial statements are presented in Korean won, which is the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency.2.4 Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of separate financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that 
may have a significant impact on the assets (liabilities) and incomes (expenses). Management’s estimates of outcomes may differ from actual outcomes if 
management’s estimates and assumptions based on management’s best judgment at the reporting date are different from the actual environment.The significant accounting estimates and assumptions are consistently applied to all periods presented, except for the assumptions for income tax expense 
and fair value of financial instruments.Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and any change in an accounting estimate is recognized prospectively by including it in profit or loss in 
the period of the change, if the change affects that period only. Alternatively, if the change in accounting estimate affects both the period of change and 
future periods, that change is recognized in the profit or loss of all those periods.Uncertainty in estimates and assumptions with significant risk that may result in material adjustment to the financial statements are as follows:2.4.1 Income taxesThe Company is operating in numerous countries and the income generated from these operations is subject to income taxes based on tax laws and 
interpretations of tax authorities in numerous jurisdictions. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. 
If certain portion of the taxable income is not used for investments, increase in wages, or dividends in accordance with the Tax System for Recirculation of 
Corporate Income, the Company is liable to pay additional income tax calculated based on the tax laws. The new tax system is effective for three years from 
2015. Accordingly, the measurement of current and deferred income tax is affected by the tax effects from the new system. As the Company’s income tax is 
dependent on the investments, increase in wages and dividends, there exists uncertainty with regard to measuring the final tax effects.2.4.2 Fair value of financial instrumentsThe fair value of financial instruments where no active market exists or where quoted prices are not otherwise available is determined by using valuation 
techniques. Financial instruments, which are not actively traded in the market and those with less transparent market prices, will have less objective fair values 
and require broad judgment on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty in market factors and assumptions in price determination and other risks (Note 5).2512.4.3 Net defined benefit liabilityThe present value of net defined benefit liability depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions 
(Note 17).3. Significant Accounting PoliciesThe significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these separate financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently 
applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated.3.1 Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, foreign currency, and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less 
that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.3.2 Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or LossThis category comprises two sub-categories: financial assets classified as held for trading, and financial assets designated by the Company as at fair value 
through profit or loss upon initial recognition.A non-derivative financial asset is classified as held for trading if either:- It is acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term, or
- It is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short- 
 term profit-taking.The Company may designate certain financial assets, other than held for trading, upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss when one of 
the following conditions is met:-  It eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as 'an accounting mismatch') that would  
 otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on different bases.
-  A group of financial assets is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or  
 investment strategy, and information about the Company is provided internally on that basis to the Company's key management personnel.
- A contract contains one or more embedded derivatives; the Company may designate the entire hybrid (combined) contract as a financial asset at fair  
 value through profit or loss if allowed by Korean IFRS 1039, Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement.After initial recognition, a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is measured at fair value and gains or losses arising from a change in the fair value 
are recognized in profit or loss. Interest income, dividend income, and gains or losses from sale and repayment from financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as net gains on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.3.3 Loans and ReceivablesNon-derivative financial assets which meet the following conditions are classified as loans and receivables:
- Those with fixed or determinable payments.
- Those that are not quoted in an active market.
- Those that the Company does not intend to sell immediately or in the near term.
- Those that the Company, upon initial recognition, does not designate as available for sale or as at fair value through profit or loss.After initial recognition, these are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.252If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured and recognized in profit or loss as provision for 
credit losses.Impairment loss on loans reduces the carrying amount of the asset through use of an allowances account, and when a loan becomes uncollectable, it is 
written off against the related allowances account. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and is objectively related to the 
subsequent event after recognition of impairment, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed by adjusting an allowances account. The amount 
of the reversal is recognized in profit or loss.3.4 Investments in Subsidiaries and AssociatesInvestments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted at cost method in accordance with Korean IFRS 1027. The Company determines at each reporting 
period whether there is any objective evidence that the investments in the subsidiaries and associates are impaired. If this is the case, the Company 
calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the subsidiaries or associates and its carrying value.3.5 Property and EquipmentRecognition and MeasurementAll property and equipment that qualify for recognition as an asset are measured at its cost and subsequently carried at cost less any accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.The cost of property and equipment includes any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating in the manner intended by management and the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on 
which it is located.Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when they prolong the useful life or enhance values of the assets but the costs of the day-to-day servicing of 
the assets such as repair and maintenance costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. When part of an item of an asset has a useful life different from 
that of the entire asset, it is recognized as a separate asset.DepreciationLand is not depreciated, whereas other property and equipment are depreciated using the method that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s future 
economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Company. The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value.Each part of an item of property and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.The depreciation method and estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:Property and equipment
Leasehold improvements
Equipment and vehiclesDepreciation method
Declining-balance
Declining-balanceEstimated useful life4 years
4 yearsThe residual value, the useful life and the depreciation method applied to an asset are reviewed at least at each financial year-end and, if expectations differ 
from previous estimates or if there has been a significant change in the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the 
asset, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.6 Intangible AssetsIntangible assets are measured initially at cost and subsequently carried at their cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment 
losses.253Intangible assets, except for membership right, are amortized using the straight-line method with no residual value over their estimated useful economic life 
since the asset is available for use.Intangible assetsSoftware
OthersAmortization methodEstimated useful lifeStraight-line
Straight-line4 years4 ~ 10 yearsThe amortization period and the amortization method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year end. Where an 
intangible asset is not being amortized because its useful life is considered to be indefinite, the Company carries out a review in each accounting period to 
confirm whether or not events and circumstances still support the assumption of an indefinite useful life. If they do not, the change from the indefinite to 
finite useful life is accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.3.7 Impairment of Non-financial AssetsThe Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset except for (i) deferred income tax 
assets, (ii) assets arising from employee benefits and (iii) non-current assets (or group of assets to be sold) classified as held for sale, may be impaired. If any 
such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.The recoverable amount is estimated for the individual asset. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, the Company 
determines the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs (the asset's cash-generating unit). A cash-generating unit is the 
smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The 
recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows 
expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit that are discounted by a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.If, and only if, the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. 
That reduction is an impairment loss and recognized immediately in profit or loss.3.8 ProvisionsProvisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching the best estimate of provisions, and 
where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of provisions are the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to 
settle the obligation.Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provisions are reversed.3.9 Equity Instrument Issued by the CompanyAn equity instrument is any contract or agreement that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from the equity.3.10 Revenue RecognitionRevenue shall be recognized when all the following conditions have been satisfied:a) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
b) It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company.
c) Specific conditions are satisfied for activities.254Interest income and expenseInterest income and expense are recognized using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized 
cost of a financial asset or a financial liability (or groups of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest expense 
over the relevant period.The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument 
or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the 
Company estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider future credit losses.Interest on impaired financial assets is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the 
impairment loss.Fee and commission incomeFee and commission income is recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of transaction.Dividend incomeDividend income is recognized when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is established.3.11 Employee Compensation and Benefits3.11.1 Post-employment benefit:Defined benefit plansAll post-employment benefit, other than defined contribution plans, is classified as defined benefit plans. The amount recognized as a defined benefit 
liability is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the end of the reporting period.The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit method. The rate used 
to discount post-employment benefit obligations is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate 
bonds. The currency and term of the corporate bonds are consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment benefit obligations. 
Actuarial gains and losses including experience adjustments and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in other comprehensive 
income.When the fair value of plan assets deducted from the total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation results in an asset, it is recognized to the 
extent of any cumulative unrecognized past service cost and the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or 
reductions in future contributions to the plan.Past service cost arises when the Company introduces a defined benefit plan that attributes to past service or changes the benefits payable for past service 
under an existing defined benefit plan. Such past service cost is recognized immediately in profit or loss.Defined contribution plansThe contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due.3.11.2 Short-term employee benefitsShort-term employee benefits are employee benefits (other than termination benefits) that are due to be settled within 12 months after the end of the255period in which the employees render the related service. The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for 
that service is recognized as a liability (accrued expense), after deducting any amount already paid.The expected cost of profit-sharing and bonus payments are recognized as liabilities when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to 
make such payments as a result of past events rendered by employees and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.3.11.3 Share-based paymentThe Company has share grant programs to directors and employees of the Company. When the stock grants are exercised, the Company can either select 
to issue new shares or distribute treasury shares, or compensate the difference in fair value of shares and exercise price.For a share-based payment transaction in which the terms of the arrangement provide the Company with the choice of whether to settle in cash or by 
issuing equity instruments, the Company determined that it has a present obligation to settle in cash because the Company has a past practice and a stated 
policy of settling in cash. Therefore, the Company accounts for the transaction in accordance with the requirements of cash-settled share-based payment 
transactions.The Company measures the services acquired and the liability incurred at fair value, and the fair value is recognized as expense and accrued expenses over 
the vesting period. Until the liability is settled, the Company remeasures the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting period and at the date of 
settlement, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the year.3.11.4 Termination benefitsTermination benefits are employee benefits provided in exchange for the termination of an employee’s employment as a result of either (a) the Company 
decision to terminate an employee’s employment before the normal retirement date; or (b) an employee’s decision to accept an offer of benefits in 
exchange for the termination of employment. The Company recognizes liabilities and expenses for termination benefits at the earlier of the following 
dates: when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Company recognizes costs for a restructuring that is within the 
scope of Korean IFRS 1037 and involves the payment of termination benefits. Termination benefits are measured by considering the number of employees 
expected to accept the offer in the case of a voluntary early retirement. Termination benefits which are not expressed to be settled wholly before 12 
months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present values.3.12 Income Tax ExpensesIncome tax expense comprises current tax expense and deferred income tax expense. Current and deferred income tax are recognized as income or 
expense and included in profit or loss for the year, except to the extent that the tax arises from (a) a transaction or event which is recognized either in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity and (b) a business combination.Current income taxCurrent income tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit (loss) for a period. A difference between the taxable profit and 
accounting profit may arise when income or expense is included in accounting profit in one period but is included in taxable profit in a different period. 
Differences may also arise if there is revenue that is exempt from taxation or expenses that is not deductible in determining taxable profit (loss). Current 
income tax liabilities (assets) for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be paid to (recovered from) the taxation authorities, 
using the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.The Company offsets current income tax assets and current income tax liabilities if, and only if, the Company (a) has a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognized amounts and (b) intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.Deferred income taxDeferred income tax is recognized, using the asset-liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax based amount of assets and liabilities256and their carrying amount in the financial statements. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. However, deferred income tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition 
of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.The carrying amount of a deferred income tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The Company reduces the carrying amount of a 
deferred income tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that 
deferred income tax asset to be utilized.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the period when the asset is realized or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement 
of deferred income tax liabilities and deferred income tax assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company 
expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.The Company offsets deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities when the Company has a legally enforceable right to offset current 
income tax assets against current income tax liabilities; and the deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity; or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current income tax 
liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of 
deferred income tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.Uncertain tax positionsUncertain tax positions arise from a claim for rectification brought by the Company, an appeal for a refund of tax levied by the tax authorities, or others 
due to different interpretation of tax laws or others. The Company recognizes its uncertain tax positions in the separate financial statements based on the 
guidance in Korean IFRS 1012. The income tax asset is recognized if a tax refund is probable for taxes paid and levied by the tax authority. However, interest 
and penalties related to income tax are recognized in accordance with Korean IFRS 1037.3.13 Earnings per ShareThe Company calculates basic earnings per share amounts and diluted earnings per share amounts for profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders 
and presents them in the statement of comprehensive income. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity 
holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the 
Company adjusts profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive

Under Korean IFRS, 
an impairment loss is based on losses incurred at the end of the reporting period. Therefore, the Company does not recognize losses expected as a result 
of future events. The Company measures inherent incurred losses on loans and presents them in the separate financial statements through the use of an 
allowance account which is offset against the related loans.Loans are classified as follows:2017(In millions of Korean won)2016Corporate loansPercentage (%)Corporate loansPercentage (%)LoansNeither past due nor impaired

29,415Liquidity risk is a risk that the Company becomes insolvency due to uncertain liquidity caused by unexpected cash outflows, or a risk of borrowing high 
interest debts or disposal of liquid and other assets at a substantial discount. The Company manages its liquidity risk through analysis of the contractual 
maturity of all financial assets and liabilities. The Company discloses them by maturity group; such as, on demand, up to one month, between over one 
month and three months, between over three months and 12 months, between over one year and five years, and over five years.Cash flows disclosed for the maturity analysis are undiscounted contractual principal and interest to be received (paid) and; thus, are not identical to the 
amount in the financial statements that are based on the present value of expected cash flows in some cases. The amount of interest to be received or paid 
on floating rate assets and liabilities is measured on the assumption that the current interest rate would be the same through the maturity.4.3.2. Liquidity Risk ManagementThe liquidity risk is managed by liquidity management principles and related guidelines which are applied to the risk management policies and procedures 
that address all the possible risks that arise from the overall business of the Company.4.3.3.

market factors that affect the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments. The most significant risk of the Company is interest rate risk.2614.4.2 Interest Rate RiskDefinition of interest rate riskInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows arising from interest income and interest cost that will fluctuate due to changes in interest.Observation method and management indicator on interest rate riskThe main objective of interest rate risk management is to protect asset values against interest rate fluctuations. The Company manages the risk through 
Value at Risk measurement and management for the interest rate.Interest Rate VaRInterest rate VaR is the maximum possible loss due to interest rate risk at a 99.9% confidence level. The measurement results of risk as of December 31, 
2017 and 2016, are as follows:2017(In millions of Korean won)2016Interest rate VaR₩159,530 ₩90,4434.5 Capital Adequacy
 
The Company complies with the capital adequacy standard established by the Financial Services Commission. The capital adequacy standard is based 
on Basel III published by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Bank for International Settlements in June 2011, and was implemented in Korea in 
December 2013. The Group is required to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 6.25%(2016: 5.375%), a minimum Tier 1 ratio of 
7.75%(2016: 6.875%) and a minimum Total Regulatory Capital ratio of 9.75%(2016: 8.875%) as of December 31, 2017.The Group's equity capital is classified into three categories in accordance with the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory Regulations on 
Financial Holding Companies as below:-  Common Equity Tier 1 Capital: Common equity Tier 1 Capital represents the issued capital that takes the first and proportionately greatest share of any 
losses and represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the Group, and not repaid outside of liquidation. It includes common shares issued, 
capital surplus, retained earnings, non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, accumulated other comprehensive income, other capital surplus 
and others.-  Additional Tier 1 Capital: Additional Tier 1 Capital includes (i) perpetual instruments issued by the Group that meet the criteria for inclusion in Additional 
Tier 1 capital, and (ii) stock surplus resulting from the issue of instruments included in Additional Tier 1 capital and others.-  Tier 2 Capital: Tier 2 Capital represents the capital that takes the proportionate share of losses in the liquidation of the Group. Tier 2 Capital includes 
a fund raised by issuing subordinated debentures maturing in not less than 5 years that meet the criteria for inclusion in Additional Tier 2 capital, and 
the allowance for loan losses which are accumulated for assets classified as normal or precautionary as a result of classification of asset soundness in 
accordance with Regulation on Supervision of Financial Holding Companies and others.Risk weighted asset means the inherent risks in the total assets held by the Group. The Group calculates risk weighted asset by each risk (credit risk, market 
risk, and operational risk) based on the Supervisory Regulations and Detailed Supervisory Regulations on Financial Holding Companies and uses it for BIS 
ratio calculation.The Group assesses and monitors its adequacy of capital by using the internal assessment and management policy of the capital adequacy. The assessment 
of the capital adequacy is conducted by comparing available capital (actual amount of available capital) and Internal Capital (amount of capital enough262to cover all significant risks under target credit rate set by the Group). The Group monitors the soundness of finance and provides risk adjusted basis for 
performance review using the assessment of the capital adequacy.Internal Capital is the amount of capital to prevent the inability of payment due to unexpected loss in the future. The Group measures, allocates and 
monitors Internal Capital by risk type and subsidiaries.The Risk Management Council of the Company determines the Group’s risk appetite and allocates Internal Capital by risk type and subsidiary. Each 
subsidiary efficiently operates its capital within a range of allocated Internal Capital. The Risk Management Department of the Company monitors the 
limit on Internal Capital and reports the results to management and the Risk Management Council. The Group maintains the adequacy of capital through 
proactive review and approval of the Risk Management Committee when the Internal Capital is expected to exceed the limits due to new business or 
business expansion.Details of the Group’s capital adequacy calculation in line with Basel III, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:20172016(In millions of Korean won)Equity Capital:Tier 1 CapitalCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital

Other financial liabilitiesFair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability could be settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length 
transaction. For each class of financial assets and financial liabilities, the Company discloses the fair value of that class of assets and liabilities in a way that 
permits it to be compared with its carrying amount at the end of each reporting period. The best evidence of fair value of financial instruments is quoted 
price in an active market. Methods of determining fair value of financial instruments are as follows:Cash and due from 
financial institutionsInvestment securitiesDerivativesLoansDebtsThe carrying amounts of cash and demand due from financial institutions and payment due from financial institutions are 
a reasonable approximation of fair values. These financial instruments do not have a fixed maturity and are receivable on 
demand. Fair value of ordinary due from financial institutions is measured using DCF model.The fair value of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets is determined using the quoted prices. Fair value 
is determined through the use of external professional valuation institution where quoted prices are not available. The 
institutions use one or more of the following valuation techniques including DCF Model, Free Cash Flow to Equity Model, 
Imputed Market Value Model, Dividend Discount Model, Risk Adjusted Discount Rate Method, and Net Asset Value Method.For exchange traded derivatives, quoted price in an active market is used to determine fair value and for OTC derivatives, fair 
value is determined using valuation techniques. The Company uses internally developed valuation models that are widely 
used by market participants to determine fair values of plain vanilla OTC derivatives including options, interest rate swaps, 
and currency swaps, based on observable market parameters. However, some complex financial instruments are valued 
using appropriate models developed from generally accepted market valuation models including the Finite Difference 
Method and the Monte Carlo Simulation or valuation results from independent external professional valuation institution.DCF model is used to determine the fair value of loans. Fair value is determined by discounting the expected cash flows, 
which are contractual cash flows adjusted by the expected prepayment rate, at appropriate discount rate.Carrying amount of overdraft in foreign currency is regarded as representative of fair value because they do not have a fixed 
maturity and are payable on demand. Fair value of other debts is determined using a DCF model discounting contractual 
future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate.DebenturesFair value is determined by using the valuations of external professional valuation institution, which are calculated using 
market inputs.Other financial assets and 
liabilitiesThe carrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair values. These financial instruments are temporary accounts used 
for other various transactions and their maturities are relatively short or not defined.Fair value hierarchyThe Company believes that valuation methods used for measuring the fair values of financial instruments are reasonable and that the fair values recognized 
in the statements of financial position are appropriate. However, the fair values of the financial instruments recognized in the statements of financial position264may be different if other valuation methods or assumptions are used. Additionally, as there is a variety of valuation techniques and assumptions used in 
measuring fair value, it may be difficult to reasonably compare the fair value with that of other financial institutions.The Company classifies and discloses fair value of the financial instruments into the three-level hierarchy as follows:Level 1: The fair values are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date.Level 2: The fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or 
indirectly.Level 3: The fair values are based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety shall be determined on the basis of the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value 
measurement in its entirety. If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that 
measurement is a Level 3 measurement.Fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statements of financial positionThe fair value hierarchy of financial assets measured at fair value in the statement of financial position as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, is as follows:(In millions of Korean won)2017Fair value hierarchyLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalFinancial assetsFinancial assets designated at fair valuethrough profit or lossDerivative-linked securitiesFinancial assetsFinancial assets designated at fair valuethrough profit or lossDerivative-linked securities₩- ₩- ₩284,485 ₩284,4852016Fair value hierarchyLevel 1Level 2Level 3Total(In millions of Korean won)₩- ₩- ₩246,656 ₩246,656Fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities whose fair values are disclosedThe fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities whose fair values are disclosed as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:265(In millions of Korean won)2017Fair value hierarchyLevel 1Level 2Level 3Total- ₩

affected by the unobservable parameters, using a statistical technique. When the fair value is affected by more than two input parameters, the amounts 
represent the most favorable or most unfavorable outcome. There are derivative-linked securities whose fair value changes are recognized in profit or loss.The results of the sensitivity analysis from changes in inputs are as follows:2017(In millions of Korean won)Recognition in profit or lossOther comprehensive incomeFavorable changesUnfavorable changesFavorable changesUnfavorable changesFinancial assetsFinancial assets designated at fairvalue through profit or lossDerivative-linked securities¹ ₩8,563 ₩(8,314) ₩- ₩-2016(In millions of Korean won)Recognition in profit or lossOther comprehensive incomeFavorable changesUnfavorable changesFavorable changesUnfavorable changesFinancial assetsFinancial assets designated at fairvalue through profit or lossDerivative-linked securities¹ ₩8,827 ₩(8,577) ₩- ₩-1 For equity securities, the changes in fair value are calculated by shifting principal unobservable input parameters; such as, discount rate, the correlation of rates of long-term interest rateand short-term interest rate, or the volatility of the interest rate is shifted by ± 1%.5.3 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesThe Company entered into master netting agreement with the counterparty through International Derivatives Swaps and Dealers Association (“ISDA”) or

Net Defined Benefit LiabilitiesDefined benefit planThe Company operates defined benefit plans which have the following characteristics:- The Company has the obligation to pay the agreed benefits to all its current and former employees.
- Actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more than expected) and investment risk fall, in substance, on the Company.The defined benefit obligation recognized in the statements of financial position is calculated by independent actuaries in accordance with actuarial 
valuation method. The defined benefit obligation is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit method (the ‘PUC’). The data used in the PUC such as interest 
rates, future salary increase rate, mortality rate and consumer price index are based on observable market data and historical data which are updated 
annually.Actuarial assumptions may differ from actual result due to change in the market, economic trend and mortality trend which may impact defined benefit 
obligation liabilities and future payments. Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in the period incurred 
through other comprehensive income.281Changes in the defined benefit obligation for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:2017(In millions of Korean won)Present value of defined benefitobligationsFair value of plan assetsNet defined benefit liabilitiesBeginning

dilutive potential ordinary shares include stock grants.A calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average market share price of the 
Company’s outstanding shares for the period) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the stock grants. The number of shares 
calculated above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of stock grants.295Adjusted profit to calculate diluted earnings per share:Profit attributable to ordinary shares

7,17632. Approval of Issuance of the Financial StatementsThe issuance of the Company’s separate financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, was approved by the Board of Directors on 
February 8, 2018.300Report of Independent Auditor's
Review of Internal Accounting Control SystemTo the President of
KB Financial Group Inc.We have reviewed the accompanying management’s report on the operations of the Internal Accounting Control System (“IACS”) of KB Financial Group 
Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2017. The Company’s management is responsible for designing and operating IACS and for its assessment of the 
effectiveness of IACS. Our responsibility is to review the management’s report on the operations of the IACS and issue a report based on our review. The 
management’s report on the operations of the IACS of the Company states that “based on its assessment of the operations of the IACS as of December 
31, 2017, the Company’s IACS has been designed and is operating effectively as of December 31, 2017, in all material respects, in accordance with the IACS 
standards established by the Internal Accounting Control System Operations Committee (IACSOC) of the Korea Listed Companies Association.”Our review was conducted in accordance with the IACS review standards established by the Korean Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards 
require that we plan and perform, in all material respects, the review of management’s report on the operations of the IACS to obtain a lower level of 
assurance than an audit. A review is to obtain an understanding of a company’s IACS and consists principally of inquiries of management and, when deemed
necessary, a limited inspection of underlying documents, which is substantially less in scope than an audit.A company’s IACS is a system to monitor and operate those policies and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the Republic of Korea (“Korean IFRS”). Because of its inherent limitations, IACS may not prevent or detect a material misstatement of the financial 
statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that management’s report on the operations of the IACS, referred to above, 
is not presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the IACS standards established by IACSOC.Our review is based on the Company’s IACS as of December 31, 2017, and we did not review management’s assessment of its IACS subsequent to December 
31, 2017. This report has been prepared pursuant to the Acts on External Audit for Stock Companies in Korea and may not be appropriate for other purposes 
or for other users.Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers
March 12, 2018301Report on the Operations of
Internal Accounting Control SystemTo the Board of Directors and Audit Committee of
KB Financial Group Inc.I, as the Internal Accounting Control Officer (“IACO”) of KB Financial Group Inc. (“the Company”), assessed the status of the design and operations of the 
Company’s internal accounting control system (“IACS”) for the year ended December 31, 2017.The Company’s management including IACO is responsible for designing and operating IACS. I, as the IACO, assessed whether the IACS has been effectively 
designed and is operating to prevent and detect any error or fraud which may cause any misstatement of the financial statements, for the purpose of 
establishing the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes. I, as the IACO, applied the IACS standard for 
the assessment of design and operations of the IACS.Based on the assessment on the operations of the IACS, the Company’s IACS has been effectively designed and is operating as of December 31, 2017, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the IACS standards.Ki Hwan Kim, Internal Accounting Control Officer
