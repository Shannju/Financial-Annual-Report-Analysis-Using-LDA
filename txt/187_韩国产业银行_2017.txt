2017
annual RepoRt09Dear clients and Readers,First of all, we are sincerely grateful for your interest and support for 
the Korea Development Bank (KDB) over the past year.startup ecosystem and paying special attention to SMEs and MEs, a 
crucial segment for improving Korea’s economic fundamentals.Despite many headwinds, 2017 in retrospect was a significant 
year for KDB as we worked hard to invigorate national economy 
and foster new growth engines for the future. It was also a year of 
surplus thanks to the untiring efforts by everyone at KDB to return to 
profitability.Throughout the year, we made a full commitment to our policy 
financing role of facilitating the real economy by continually making 
funds available to the country’s industries, with a special emphasis 
on SMEs and MEs and sectors deemed essential as Korea’s next 
engines of growth. We also implemented normalization procedures 
for each of the companies in our restructuring portfolio.At the same time, as a financial control tower for the 4th Industrial 
Revolution, we made a significant effort to establish a support 
system, for instance by coming up with Industry 4.0 classification and 
support standards through our New Growth Engine Industry Policy 
Finance Center.We also strengthened our investment platform, KDB Next Round, 
to help create an ecosystem of startups and ventures. Another area 
of priority was revitalizing our overseas business through diverse 
efforts which included leveraging the Global Infrastructure Fund to 
further encourage domestic companies’ effort to go global.On the sustainability front, KDB issued green bonds to build up 
investors leading environmental and social impact, while executing 
investment for renewable and energy efficiency projects as well.Looking ahead, 2018 will be an inflection point for the Korean 
economy. The country stands at a juncture of wide-ranging 
technological innovations and a resulting transition of a global scale 
in many industries. In order to take Korea beyond the inflection 
point and make yet another leap forward by shifting its economic 
paradigms, KDB will focus on promoting innovative growth and 
proactively respond to the new wave of change, accompanied by 
efforts to increase its competitiveness and reinforce the stability of 
policy finance in the country.To this end, KDB will move forward with a sense of duty and 
confidence to restore soundness and vitality of the Korean economy, 
improve the fundamentals and competitiveness of companies and 
industries, and step up its corporate social responsibilities.This will be done by leveraging the venture capital at our disposal 
such as the Growth Support Fund and the Global Partnership Fund to 
scale up the development of innovative companies. Simultaneously, 
we will provide financial solutions to foster future industries and 
promote existing players’ transition to a new era by strengthening our 
market-driven platforms such as KDB Next Round and IP Mart.Our focus on SMEs and MEs will ensure that our policy financing 
initiatives, for instance KDB Global Challenger 200 Program, will 
directly link up with generating growth momentum for the economy, 
marked by stronger fundamentals and decent jobs.Secondly, we will continue to develop new financial markets abroad 
and pursue a paradigm shift in Korea’s corporate restructuring. Our 
efforts overseas will encourage domestic SMEs and MEs to venture 
abroad, while pioneering global markets through the expansion of 
overseas project finance and cross-border loans.For corporate restructuring, we will promote a market-driven 
restructuring scheme with a focus on preventing corporate failures 
before they take place and strengthening the competitiveness 
inherent in each company. This will require us to lay the foundation 
for utilizing private capital in restructuring through efforts including 
creating restructuring funds for public-private matching.Thirdly, we will focus on strengthening our role as a responsible 
corporate citizen and ensuring sustainability in policy finance. For 
this, we will take the initiative in encouraging social responsibility 
practices by increasing funds for social enterprises and promoting 
mutual growth among companies, while actively applying global 
standards on our operations such as the Equator Principles.In order to ensure sustainability in policy finance and thereby 
solidifying the groundwork for a sustainable growth, we plan to 
steadily enhance the quality of our operating assets by managing 
the portfolios closely in line with our mid- to long-term strategies, 
continually improving profit and financial soundness along the way.At this critical inflection point before a historic change, all of us at 
KDB will unite in 2018 to bring ourselves closer to our vision “Financial 
Engine for Korea’s Takeoff - Global KDB” by constantly thinking 
outside the box and proactively adjusting to changes both anticipated 
and unanticipated.First, we will take a leadership role in reorienting the industries 
towards the 4th Industrial Revolution by further strengthening theThank you very much and we ask for your continued trust and

Review of 2017KDB proactively facilitates preemptive corporate structural 
adjustment and business realignment as Korea’s leading 
financial institution, while providing customized financial 
services through a wide range of financial products. KDB 
strives for sustainable development of the national economy 
by fostering stronger competitiveness for corporate clients 
through support for stable growth of MEs and the provision of 
financial support associated with the 4th Industrial Revolution.In 2017, the domestic economy witnessed higher demand 
in export and CAPEX driven by a gradual turnaround of 
the global economy and the synchronous recovery of both 
advanced and emerging markets. As such, we further tapped 
into industries that will serve as growth engines in the 
future through the provision of financing, seeking to locate 
growth engines throughout the economy. We also took the 
lead in creating an economic ecosystem for the balanced 
mutual growth of corporate groups and MEs by proactively 
inducing corporate groups to realign their businesses toward 
stronger core competencies and the acquisition of new 
growth engines, while stepping up the supply of financing by 
expanding our reach to new MEs.However, monetary tightening and trade protectionism in 
major economies posed downside risks on the domestic 
economy. Accordingly, KDB encouraged corporate groups 
struggling with temporary shortages in liquidity to perform 
preemptive restructuring by implementing self-rehabilitation 
plans, while making real and effective financial support 
available based on constant liquidity monitoring and other 
means of systematic risk management. By doing so, we 
strived to counter risks and ensure that a crisis from certain 
companies doesn’t spread throughout the economy.In 2017, the total amount of funds supplied by KDB reached 
KRW 64.4 trillion, among which KRW 42.0 trillion was 
extended to SMEs/MEs, approximately 65.2% of the total. 
In particular, KDB extended KRW 2.4 trillion and KRW 0.4 
trillion through its SME/ME funding vehicles, the ‘Corporate 
Investment Stimulus Program’ and the ‘Mutual Growth Fund’. 
We also committed ourselves to participating in the ‘Inter-
ministerial Task Force for Innovation in Policies for MEs’ led by 
the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy in September 2017,which enhanced collaboration among the relevant bodies 
from the government, financial institutions and industry 
associations to nurture MEs of Korea.Funds supplied to MEs*

through major changes driven by convergence among 
industries against the backdrop of the 4th Industrial Revolution. 
Companies will move quickly to adjust to the changes, and 
the financial sector is likely to fall in line accordingly. As KDB 
aims to establish itself as ‘a financial institution leading the 
4th Industrial Revolution’, it plans to expand the supply of 
financing to foster key areas and technologies that drive the 
Revolution.KDB Global Challengers 200By corporate

AnnuAl RePORt19Consulting
Since 2003, KDB has been involved with over 800 projects in 
various sectors, including management/finance, public service/
development, corporate turnarounds, as well as in-house 
and overseas consulting. In 2017, our key focus was corporate 
growth and preemptive risk management and consulting 
services for such purposes made up 40% of the total.Key plans for 2018 are to provide customized consulting for 
MEs and SMEs by their respective growth stages, with a 
particular focus on providing specific management consulting 
to help them adapt to the 4th Industrial Revolution.Corporate RestructuringReview of 2017As a policy finance institution, KDB does its utmost to pursue 
timely normalization of companies undergoing restructuring. 
We have served as a safety net for the national economy 
and major industries through principle-based efficient 
restructuring. In particular, our safety net contributed to 
stabilizing the market as we promptly responded to corporate 
insolvencies in corporate groups that might have had a 
massive impact on the nation’s economy, while striving to 
improve fundamentals and competitiveness of domestic 
companies.In addition, we steadily pursued normalization of companies 
struggling with the unprecedented downturn in the industries 
as a result of the elongated global economic slowdown. Such 
efforts aim at minimizing the potential impact of a crisis on the 
national economy and intensifying industrial competitiveness 
through structural improvements.Plans for 2018In 2018, KDB plans to continue to serve as a safety net in the 
market, while providing financial means to help companies 
successfully normalize their businesses at the earliest date 
possible by initiating measures based on disciplined corporate 
restructuring. Moreover, we will actively seek to implement 
preemptive restructuring by encouraging voluntary structural 
realignment and financial improvements.To this end, we will make use of our accumulated know-how 
in restructuring and specialized workforce. KDB will help 
distressed companies continuously implement prompt and 
efficient restructuring measures to help them recover swiftly 
as it strives to enhance the national economy and ensure 
renewed growth in a variety of different fields.growth potential to help them grow into global top-notch 
companies. Through the program, we hope to assist with 
their technological innovation by facilitating their CAPEX and 
R&D investments while offering them with comprehensive 
financial  services  ranging  from  derivatives  and  F/X 
management to M&A advisory and business consulting.On-lending
On-lending is one of Korea’s representative policy finance 
programs. When financial intermediaries, such as commercial 
banks in Korea, request funds by selecting targeted SMEs 
and MEs, KDB supplies long term, low-interest rate funds to 
finance those intermediaries, which in turn lend the funds to 
qualified companies.KDB supplied a total of KRW 7.2 trillion to about 6,700 
companies in 2017 through the on-lending program, up 
approximately KRW 1.0 trillion from the previous year, serving 
as a springboard for the growth of SMEs and MEs.In 2018, KDB plans to launch and manage special on-lending 
products aiming to expand financial support for outstanding 
tech firms along with preliminary R&D assistance for 
developing core technologies of the 4th Industrial Revolution.On-lending loans supplied by year

Review of 2017KDB is the only bank in Korea with the license to arrange 
domestic corporate bond issuances. KDB also maintains a 
leading position in arranging and underwriting securities 
issuances, providing advisory services in structured finance, 
and arranging syndicated loans.In 2017, KDB successfully arranged the issuance of an Arirang 
bond by Nomura International Funding for three consecutive 
years since 2015, positioning itself as a competitive partner 
for procuring KRW for global financial companies. KDB laid 
the foundation for the Korean capital market to expand into 
a reliable funding source for foreign companies with prime 
credit ratings.KDB also arranged the issuance of a USD-denominated 
‘Foreign Exchange Stabilization Bond’ at the lowest ever 
rate by capturing the most optimal timing in the market, 
establishing a benchmark for private borrowing and 
fulfilling the role as Korea’s representative investment 
bank. Moreover, by arranging Korean companies’ public and 
private bond placement activities overseas, KDB helped to 
secure sufficient foreign funding necessary for their business 
operations.Another notable highlight of 2017 was the ‘Best Securitization 
Deal, Korea’ that KDB received from The Asset, an economic 
and financial magazine in Asia, for the successful issuance of 
a cross-border ABS securitizing airfare receivables without 
any credit enhancement from financial institutions.Plans for 2018In 2018, we will strengthen our overseas DCM business by 
expanding the horizons for the operations. Based on our 
accumulated experiences, we will play a leading role in 
arranging Arirang bonds for foreign companies with prime 
credit ratings in line with the government’s policies to 
globalize the domestic capital market.In addition, we will offer differentiated DCM products to 
nurture SMEs, MEs, and new growth industries in tandem 
with government policies for innovative growth. We will fullyencourage industrial innovation and the continued growth of 
SMEs and MEs by offering products which are suited to the 
nature of each industry and company including mezzanine 
and structured products to enhance the accessibility of SMEs 
and MEs to the capital market.M&A
Review of 2017KDB provides financial advisory services on M&As for 
companies at home and abroad. We also arrange financing 
for companies that are seeking to refinance their existing 
borrowing after or during an M&A transaction.In 2017, we successfully advised on the sale of companies 
(Hyundai Cement, Oriental Precision and Engineering, 
and STX Engine, etc.) under our restructuring portfolio. In 
particular, the successful sale of the equity in Hyundai Cement 
held by creditors in 2017 took place against a backdrop of an 
industry-wide restructuring in the cement sector. Not only 
the deal contributed to the normalization of the insolvent 
company by putting an end to the work-out procedure but 
also improved KDB’s financial structure through gains from 
the sale.Furthermore, we stepped up acquisition financing by 
arranging  funds  for  Prostar  Capital’s  acquisition  of 
Kyungnam Energy, MBK’s acquisition of Daesung Industrial 
Gases, and a refinancing for Coway. Over the past three 
years, KDB has advised on transactions worth USD 1.6 
billion per year on average. The number of transactions we 
advised on in 2017 grew to eight from four last year, driven 
by a rise in M&A activities among MEs.Plans for 2018In 2018, we are committed to promoting the steady growth 
of domestic companies and exploring global markets 
by facilitating cross-border M&As and encouraging the 
discovery of innovation-driven SMEs and MEs through 
advisory support on promising new industries. Furthermore, 
we will continually advise on M&As to promote market-driven 
restructuring by selling off our equity stakes in portfolio 
companies, while supporting the normalization of marginal 
companies through preemptive and ex-post restructuring.KDb bAnK

We were a ‘market pioneer’ and created an initial market in 
Korea during the 1980s when F/X and derivatives products 
were scarce in Korea. Currently, we not only handle general 
derivatives trading operations but also are capable of 
providing foreign exchange and derivatives solutions to 
customers unable to utilize hedging products due to credit 
ratings and other issues. As such, we endeavor to provide 
optimal solutions to respective customers to adhere to their 
interests and enhance our reputation in the markets.Review of 2017In 2017, the Bank of Korea raised the base rate for the first 
time in seven years following the U.S rate hikes and growing 
volatility fuelled by geopolitical concerns. Even under the 
pressing market conditions, KDB offered hedge products 
customized to the needs of the corporate clients, drawing 
on its extensive experiences and a seasoned group of 
professionals.As a result, KDB was ranked No.1 among Korean banks 
in terms of the outstanding balance of derivatives in 2017 
for the second year in a row. KDB was also selected as the 
best derivatives house in Korea by Asia Risk, a magazine 
specializing in derivatives.Derivatives trading volume

In addition, we strengthened our capability to manage 
structured products by issuing structured notes denominated

corporate clients through timely offering of diverse and 
customized products designed to promote business stability

its structured product portfolio for non-resident clients to 
include derivatives involving ship/aircraft financing and 
international PF transactions. Along with global business 
expansion through establishing an Asian currency NDF 
trading platform, KDB will ensure that all these efforts lead to 
solidifying its presence as Korea’s top-tier derivatives house.Money Market & Capital Market TradingReview of 2017As volatility in the global financial market heightened 
following the three interest rate hikes by the Fed in 2017, we 
beefed up our flexible responses to changes in the market, 
while controlling risks by diversifying our portfolios by region, 
sector, and maturity with a focus on high-quality assets in 
advanced economies. In addition, we implemented portfolio 
strategies to increase the weight of countries and sectors 
with high growth potential. We also worked to manage 
the credit and interest rate risks based on flexible hedging 
driven by portfolio diversification, IRS trading, and duration 
adjustments. As a result, in 2017, KDB recorded a stable 
investment income and fulfilled its goal of managing foreign 
currency liquidity.Plans for 2018In 2018, we will also focus on acquiring stable income and 
minimizing risks through diversified investments in products 
including stocks, bonds, and short-term financial vehicles 
(MMF and CD) in the Chinese market, which remains an 
attractive investment destination despite the recent economic 
slowdown. In particular, we will strive to acquire hedging 
instruments for interest rate risks in the onshore Chinese

KDB’s overseas network covers 26 cities in 21 countries as of 
the end of 2017. In 2017, we designated Asia as the key area 
for business, which has high growth potentials and financial 
demand in tandem with the government’s New Southern 
Policy, while establishing ‘mid-and long-term global business 
strategies’ for systematic overseas entry.Accordingly, we decided to launch Asia Regional Head Office in 
Singapore as the business hub in Southeast Asia, and entrust 
roles as a control tower covering our branches in Southeast 
Asia, China, and Japan. KDB strives to acquire dominance in 
the Asian financial market by utilizing syndicated loans and 
overseas PF operations, key strengths of KDB, to take the lead 
as ‘Global KDB’, facilitating the entry of Korean companies into 
global markets.In 2018, KDB is committed to improving portfolios for overseas 
assets and realigning its organizational structure for overseas 
business by fully leveraging its core competencies. Plans 
are underway to expand opportunities for engagement in 
Southeast Asian markets with high financial demand for 
infrastructure investment and resources development through 
syndicated loans and overseas PF, etc. Moreover, we plan 
to increase the portion of non-Korean assets up to 50% of 
overseas assets by 2021, focusing on corporate borrowers with 
prime credit ratings in major countries.Cross-Border Syndicated Loans
The syndicated loan market slowed down in the Asia 
Pacific region as political risks increased throughout 2017. 
Nevertheless, KDB reported favorable performance by 
proactively discovering customers with prime credit ratings, 
and providing financial arrangement services in emerging 
economies such as Chile and Vietnam.In 2017, we played a key role in establishing a foothold as a 
leader among Korean banks in the global financial market by 
arranging the following deals: Reliance Industries (India), 
Dewan Housing Finance Corp. (India), PT Astra Sedaya 
Finance (Indonesia), and Winson Oil International Ltd. (Hong 
Kong). In particular, KDB’s arrangement of a syndicated loan 
worth USD 1.5 billion for Reliance Industries was the largest 
of its kind jointly conducted with 19 globally-renownedbanks. The financial arrangement for India’s largest private 
company with a strong global presence has contributed to 
expanding our business base within India, a representative 
emerging market.In 2018, we plan to proactively pursue the expansion of 
KDB's financial territory based on our entry into the global 
syndication market, while scaling up the presence of Korean 
financial industry by continuously looking for opportunities 
to participate in international financial transactions. To this 
end, we will devise strategies reflecting the nature of local 
business in each region by collaborating with global financial 
institutions specialized in local markets, and by identifying 
promising industries in each major country. By doing so, 
we will strive to enhance the reputation of KDB in overseas 
markets through region-specific market approaches.Non-Korean cross-border banking assets*

(Unit: 1,000 people)201520162017In 2018, we seek to improve the funding structure by further 
facilitating SME and ME deposits, leveraging our strength as a 
corporate banking specialist, and also to focus on policies that 
expand financial support for SMEs and MEs. In addition, we 
plan to reinforce our funding basis for stable financing through 
the expansion of non face-to-face products and services.Liquidity Management
KDB ensures the stable management of liquidity through 
diverse management strategies including operations of call 
loans, Repo, MMF, and CP, utilizing surplus funds.As volatility in the global financial market is expected to 
increase, likely due to an additional rise of the interest rates 
in the U.S., KDB will look to avoid liquidity gaps through 
preemptive risk management by maintaining an optimal level 
of liquidity through closely monitoring market conditions and 
flexibly adapting to supply-and-demand swings.Against this backdrop, KDB strives for stable management 
of funds based on diversified investment by product type 
and maturity structure for appropriate liquidity and risk 
management.secure a stable supply of capital required to develop and foster 
industry through timely financing in tandem with the financial 
market environment and the flow of internal funds.Foreign currency-denominatedReview of 2017In 2017, despite a geopolitical risk, KDB succeeded in 
issuing global bonds under favorable conditions through 
flexible issuance strategies. In addition, KDB issued green 
bonds, while executing investment for green projects. We 
also diversified financing channels by easing dependence 
on the USD market through the financing in niche markets, 
issuing Formosa Bonds and Sterling Bonds, and appealing to 
investors in different regions with high credit ratings. In total, 
we issued approximately USD 5.5 billion in foreign currency-
denominated KDB bonds during 2017. The outstanding 
balance stood at USD 23.2 billion.Plans for 2018In 2018, our funding strategy will continue to focus on flexibility, 
bracing for potential changes in the market such as base rate 
hikes and tapering in advanced countries. In addition to USD-
denominated global bonds, KDB will constantly monitor market 
conditions and serve as Korea’s benchmark borrower in various 
markets covering EUR, JPY-denominated bonds, sustainability 
bonds, etc. Simultaneously, we will make concerted efforts to 
improve borrowing conditions for Korean institutions hit hard 
by geopolitical risks while expanding our supranational, sub-
sovereign, and agency (SSA) investor base.Deposits 
KDB is at the forefront of the continued supply of funds by 
properly supplementing KDB Bonds, which are sensitive to 
market conditions, with KRW-denominated deposits. KDB 
has continued to reduce funding costs by attracting SME/
ME deposits and money market deposit accounts through 
strategic management. This has established the foundation 
for stable funding. For instance, we launched KDB Partners 
Bank Book, a specialized product for MEs, in February 2017, 
attracting approximately KRW 1.1 trillion in deposits in 2017, 
which contributed to facilitating SME deposits and stable 
maintenance of deposits.RisK 
MAnAgeMent34RisK MAnAgeMentKDB effectively manages the diverse risks that are involved in 
maintaining its soundness based on the following principles:while also monitoring constant risk variables. The Council 
sets distribution limits by divisions for the Bank, as well as 
limits for trading losses and limits for exchange positions 
within the risk limits set by the Committee.KDb Risk Management PrinciplesKey committees and councils for risk management• Risk must be managed in a manner that is independent,  
  comprehensive, and uniform on a bank-wide basis;Board of 
Directors• Risk must be accurately identified, measured, and  
  evaluated, and properly managed;• Risk must be maintained at a level in balance to profit;• Risk must be diversified to prevent a buildup of assets  
  concentrated in a specific category; and• Risk must be managed within certain limits or guidelinesin order to prevent undue exposure.Effective Risk Management through 
Specialized CouncilsKDB runs independent committees and councils for prompt 
and effective decision-making related to risk management. 
The  Risk  Management  Committee  is  KDB’s  highest 
consultative body, composed of independent directors with 
extensive experience and knowledge of finance and economic 
matters. The Committee examines and makes decisions on 
yearly risk management plans and the setting of total risk 
limits deemed appropriate by KDB. Chaired by one of the 
Bank's independent directors, the Committee is equipped 
with a decision-making mechanism that maintains balanced 
views on critical risk management matters for the Bank. 
Agenda items for decision-making at the Risk Management 
Committee are reported to the Board of Directors.A total of 16 agenda items were reported to the Risk 
Management Committee in 2017. Key agenda adopted for 
resolution included the basic risk management plans for 2017 
and matters associated with redevelopment of the corporate 
credit rating system. Agenda which were reported to the 
Committee included key issues on risk management such 
as analysis report on bank-wide stress test results and BIS 
capital ratio verification.The Risk Management Council is a body that consists of heads

Credit risks
Credit risks refer to possible losses in the event of the failure 
of counterparties to carry out their obligations. We measure 
credit risks for the entire Bank and for individual sectors across 
all assets exposed to risk using the Credit Manager System.Market risks
Market risks refer to possible losses to the Bank’s assets 
resulting from fluctuations of interest rates, stock prices, 
foreign exchange rates, and other variables. We measure 
and manage possible losses in trading positions (including 
positions from securities and derivatives held for trading) due 
to negative movements of market indices.Moreover, by classifying the severity of market movements 
into three stages - precautionary, semi-crisis, and crisis 
stages - in accordance with the degree of fluctuation of 
standard indices, we maintain Market Risk Contingency Plans 
appropriate to each of the three stages. We also conduct 
stress tests to measure the potential scale of losses based onKDb bAnK
2017
AnnuAl RePORt35scenarios of significant fluctuations in major market indices 
over the last three years.interest risks
Interest risks refer to possible losses that might occur when 
interest rate movements negatively affect the Bank’s financial 
status. We ensure continual monitoring of interest rate Value 
at Risk (VaR), which measures the reduction of net present 
value (NPV), and interest Eanings at Risk (EaR), which 
measures the decrease of net interest income, with regular 
simulations based on scenarios of interest rate fluctuations.liquidity risks
Liquidity risk refers to the possibility of default due to a shortage 
in funds resulting from a mismatch of financing and management 
periods or an unexpected financial outflow. In addition, since 
the 2008 financial crisis, we take into consideration the quality of 
liquidity and its ability to withstand cash outflow in contingency 
situations when managing liquidity.Operational risks
Operational risks refer to possible losses which may occur due 
to misleading internal procedures, employees, systems, and 
external incidents. We analyze why they occurred, quantify 
each risk level and manage them accordingly. Through a 
Control Self-Assessment (CSA) program implemented at 
three-month intervals, we ask employees to assess potential 
operational risks associated with their job activities in order to 
ascertain that such risks are properly managed in accordance 
with established guidelines.We have developed business continuity plans by job function to 
guard against possible business disruptions due to disasters, 
strikes, and other emergencies. Yearly mock-up drills are held 
to ensure that major operations of the Bank can be resumed 
within a target timeframe in case of an emergency.Review of 2017In 2017, KDB has steadily improved its risk management 
system in tandem with intensifying risk management standards 
imposed at home and abroad. First, the corporate credit 
assessment models were redeveloped to reflect the nature 
of KDB specialized in corporate banking. While reclassifying 
the existing 10-tier credit rating system into a 14-tier system, 
financial assessment was adopted for non-resident models, thus 
raising objectivity in credit assessment.Furthermore, we made revision to the current system to reduce 
concentration risks over the long term. In 2017, we launched 
a unit dedicated to credit portfolio management, designed 
to lower concentration risks and help create sound credit 
portfolios across the Bank. In particular, based on the internal 
principles of credit portfolio management, we made rational 
distribution of credit limits by company, affiliate, and industry. 
All these efforts were aligned with the Bank’s operating 
policies, contributing to laying the foundation for an effective 
portfolio management.Lastly, we have proactively responded to more stringent risk 
management standards around the globe. Besides successfully 
complying with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) regulations 
for foreign currencies adopted in 2017, we have improved the 
risk management system for compliance with the IFRS9 and 
the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) regulations.Plans for 2018We are committed to steadily improving the risk management 
system to lay the foundation for sustainable growth in policy 
financing. To this end, we plan to initiate portfolio adjustment 
in phases by setting mid-and long-term targets based on 
concentration and industry risks. While differentiating exposure 
management by identifying risk factors and growth potential 
by company, affiliate, and industry, we will adequately manage 
risk exposure within acceptable levels.At  the  same  time,  we  will  further  elaborate  the  risk 
management system in line with changes in the industrial 
structure driven by the 4th Industrial Revolution. In particular, 
we plan to establish a response strategy by preemptively 
analyzing the impact of potential risks on the business 
portfolios of the Bank, while identifying risk factors related to 
disruptive innovation technologies and conducting research to 
devise countermeasures.Lastly, we will stay ahead of strengthening regulations in the 
global financial system. While seeking to fully comply with 
regulations adopted in 2018, we will do our utmost to ensure 
new regulations such as the Fundamental Review of the 
Trading Book (FRTB) and regulations on large-scale exposures 
are seamlessly adopted for stronger levels of soundness in the 
financial system.ethiCAl 
MAnAgeMent36ethiCAl MAnAgeMentComplianceKDB practices ethical management by continuously realigning 
its anti-corruption infrastructure and running a wide range of 
programs to promote its code of conduct. Effective training on 
ethics for employees is provided to boost ethical awareness, 
and a culture of ethical management has taken root to 
cultivate a transparent and fair workplace.2017 was a year that required a high level of ethical awareness 
as well as fair conduct of business by employees in policy 
finance institutions. In addition, the external financial 
environment underwent rapid changes with the advent 
of the 4th Industrial Revolution. Also, crimes, illegal acts, 
and overheated speculation have resulted from extreme 
fluctuations in the valuation of cryptocurrencies.Aiming to proactively respond to these changes, we have 
made concerted efforts to enable the 1) establishment of an 
autonomous anti-corruption culture of integrity to eradicate 
potential inside corruption and irregularities; and 2) creation 
of a bank-wide compliance infrastructure based on an 
effective internal control system.As part of such efforts, the newly launched ‘Working-level 
Council on Internal Control’ is in operation consisting of team 
heads from internal control-related departments. The aims 
of the council are enhanced management of the ‘Internal 
Control Committee’ which was organized in 2016 and prior 
consultation on the agenda of the Committee.Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Commission upgraded 
both KDB’s Integrity Assessment (IA) and Anti-Corruption 
Initiatives Assessment (AIA) ratings after its evaluation in 
2017. In addition, on-site compliance training took place for 
employees in the headquarters and branches.Under the goal of adopting strengthened standards against 
money laundering, we have implemented risk assessment 
for money laundering and financing of terrorism, improved 
Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) rules, enhanced quality 
and promptness in reporting, and intensified internal controls 
related to anti-money laundering at overseas branches. In 
2017, in particular, we conducted risk assessment for money 
laundering and financing of terrorism at both domestic and 
overseas branches, and made improvements based on the 
outcomes.Lastly, we took measures to improve the ethical management 
system for financial subsidiaries by establishing an internal 
control process. Specifically, we verified the implementation 
status of ethical management plans and conducted management 
evaluations on a monthly basis at each of the subsidiaries.Major compliance management programsethical Management

specific areas: 1) internal controls, 2) ethical management, 
and 3) anti-money laundering.In terms of internal controls, we will devise a ‘checklist 
for compliance monitoring’ reflecting the nature of our 
operations and enhance the role of internal control specialists 
to encourage effective compliance monitoring.In order to promote a culture of autonomous integrity and

money transfers in order to boost our ability to address 
risks resulting from the development of new technologies. 
Furthermore, we will enhance internal controls related to anti-
money laundering operations at our overseas branches.Consumer ProtectionKDB continuously improves its systems to promote mutual 
growth with customers based on core values – the protection 
of the rights of financial consumers.KDB engages in diverse efforts to protect the rights of 
financial services consumers in tandem with growing focus 
on consumer protection.First, we review and regularly examine factors which may 
infringe on consumer rights throughout a business cycle – 
product development, selling, and after-sale – by setting 
protection guidelines for each stage, thus preventing improper or 
incomplete selling of products. Moreover, departments in charge 
of product development and sales share with each other recent 
consumer protection issues and maintain close cooperation as 
part of the Financial Consumer Protection Council. Driven by 
such endeavors, KDB acquired ‘Excellent’ ratings in all categories 
in the ‘Evaluation of Consumer Protection Status’ organized by 
the Financial Supervisory Service in 2017.We also systematized the complaint handling system to foster 
a customer service mindset throughout the Bank and improve 
overall customer satisfaction. We set up an SMS-based 
notification service as part of the complaint handling procedure 
to promptly address customer inquiries. Training takes place on 
handling complaints in conjunction with an analysis of frequent 
complaints and the distribution of a checklist for the prevention 
of such issues. By doing so, we strive to reduce the volume 
of customer complaints. Furthermore, we do our utmost to 
upgrade service satisfaction levels by conducting in-house 
surveys on consumer satisfaction.We also make concerted efforts to protect the personal 
information of customers. We have established specific 
standards at each stage of personal information handling andcheck the status of personal information management on a 
regular basis. As a result, KDB earned an ‘Excellent’ rating in

market, including older consumers and the disabled.Moreover, we will establish a system for constant feedback 
based on customer opinions so that all employees can share 
case studies of complaint handling and KDB can become a

Fully-accredited GCF Implementing Entity→CASE 1KDB seeks to retain forward-looking global talent driven 
by passion and determination, with the qualifications and 
sense of ethics needed to lead the development of the Korean 
financial industry.Fair and Competency-driven 
Recruitment of TalentKDB was accredited as an Implementing Entity of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for 
the first time among Korean institutions in December 2016, followed by the signing of 
the Accreditation Master Agreement in April 2017, the final confirmation step in the 
GCF Implementing Entity protocol. The accreditation was evidence that KDB has made 
strides as a world-class financial institution equipped with management systems, 
environmental and social standards complying with global standards equivalent 
to those of other international organizations and advanced financial institutions. In 
addition, KDB organized the Climate Financing Forum in July 2017 under the theme of 
the Business Development of Korean companies and the Roles of Finance in Response 
to Climate Change, inviting Korean companies looking to work with the GCF in the area 
of renewable energies. KDB shared its insights on the roles of climate financing and 
case studies of new and renewable energy projects in developing countries as a GCF 
Implementing Entity.We also introduced the Open Position System in 2017, which 
enabled us to hire specialized personnel for three strategic 
areas of the bank operations – the 4th Industrial Revolution, 
litigation, and risk management - using an open competition 
held both internally and externally. Through the system, we 
contributed to intensifying workforce expertise and imbued 
vitality within the corporate culture.Training Programs for Development 
of Global Talent→KDB recruits new employees each year so that the Bank 
can undertake effective responses to the changing external 
economic situation and business environment influenced by 
the 4th Industrial Revolution, etc., and intensify organizational 
competencies. By adopting ‘blind recruitment’ practices to 
ensure equal opportunity and fair selection, the fairness of 
recruitment procedures has been enhanced. Competency-
driven recruitment of talent is promoted with an emphasis 
on recruits’ basic capabilities as well as a focus on financial 
sector specialization combined with an assessment of 
organizational fit. In 2017, we recruited 64 new employees 
through a multi-dimensional evaluation in each recruitment 
stage reflecting the National Competency Standards (NCS).Adoption of the equator PrinciplesWe offer our employees a wide variety of opportunities to 
further cultivate relevant expertise or redirect their pursuit 
of knowledge to areas other than their current field. For this, 
a career training roadmap curriculum is in place based on 
job function and by career phase, and a variety of in-house 
training courses are offered covering key areas including 
loans, deposits, and F/X transactions. To free its employees 
from time and location constraints, KDB also offers virtual 
training programs through KDB e-campus, in partnership 
with professional training institutions.As the only Korean institution to have adopted the Equator Principles - the 
international norms in the financial industry on environmental and social risk 
management in project finance, KDB has established internal regulations for 
environmental and social risk reviews in projects. We assign three categories from 
A to C in the order of environmental and social risks to projects which are subject to 
the scope of the Equator Principles (corporate loans over USD 50 million and PFs 
exceeding USD 10 million in size). Then we thoroughly review if environmental and 
social management plans are appropriately established for each of the projects in line 
with designated categories.CASE 2Efforts to Intensify Job Expertise→CASE 3To improve individual job competency and thus maximize 
organizational capability, we have segmented the entirety 
of our business operations into 172 categories and actively 
supported  the  development  of  individual  employee 
competencies in the category of their choice through our 
Career Development Program (CDP). The program is 
divided into exploration, development, and master phases. 
Employees in the first phase are given chances to strengthen 
their basic capabilities through CDP and at the same time to 
broaden their experience in other relevant job tasks.SectorIn addition, specialized job functions requiring more 
expertise are filled with employees selected through an open 
competitive in-house process. In 2017, certain job posts in 
project finance, risk management, industrial analysis and 
evaluation were filled through this process, with more efforts 
on the way to develop employee specialties.Furthermore, there is a wide range of programs geared 
toward developing skills crucial to tap into new overseas 
markets; particularly to train regional specialists to be 
dispatched to Indonesia, Vietnam, and China, where KDB 
expects an increase in demand for qualified personnel among 
its workforce. KDB also trains employees as part of its efforts 
to explore global markets through foreign language training 
courses offered before and after working hours. Relevant 
employees are sent to overseas networks in London, Hong 
Kong, Brazil, Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai and other places 
for on-the-job-training in partnership with global partner 
institutions.In June 2017, KDB issued a Green Bond (USD 300 million, 5-year maturity) to facilitate 
projects related to new renewable energies, while attracting investors interested in 
eco-friendly and socially responsible investment.Green Bond IssuerAllocation of net proceeds
As of December 31, 2017, 100% of the net proceeds from the Green Bond issued in June 
2017 were allocated to KDB’s selected green portfolio as shown in the table below.RegionsApart from regular training, KDB also offers opportunities 
at home and abroad to those who want to advance their 
academic aptitude at the graduate level. For employees who

The CO2 emission avoided (CO2e Avoided) by using renewable energy generated from KDB’s 
green portfolio serves as an indicator of environmental impact. If all projects under KDB green 
portfolio are completed and under operations, then the total CO2e Avoided from the green 
portfolio will be 5,645,212 tons per year and KDB Share out of the total CO2e Avoided be 425,577 
tons per year. Considering investors’ investment in KDB Green Bond, the CO2e Avoided per 1 USD 
invested in KDB Green Bond would be 1.42 kg/Year.SectorRegionsEnergy Generation

ReViewsponsorship targeting those unable to receive welfare benefits
KDB aims to discover welfare support blind spots, characterized by an absence of welfare benefits 
despite a desperate need for financial support and subsequently provide support in the spirit of 
‘Daddy-Long-Legs’. KDB began the program at the end of 2016 to explore recipient candidates 
among the underprivileged without support from the government or companies, and sponsor them 
by collecting information from the mass media, news reports, the National Police Agency, and local 
governments, etc. In 2017, we provided sponsorship in 19 cases starting with ‘support for exemplary 
servicemen facing financial struggles‘.Kimchi sharing
Every year since 2008, we have held kimchi-making events with our employees, executives’ wives 
club, and the Seoul City Women’s Society, and delivered kimchi to the needy. In November, 2017, 
we made around 12,000 cabbages of kimchi and delivered them to underprivileged households and 
welfare centers in Seoul.support for yeouido Park skating Rink
In 2015, KDB started to sponsor the construction of an ice skating rink in Yeouido Park, a project 
designed to transform an unpopular park in winter into a sports and cultural hotspot for Seoul citizens 
and a new tourist attraction that can represent Seoul. ‘Yeoui Ice Park’ was created as a result of our 
suggestion for a public interest project to the Seoul Metropolitan Government and now marks its 
third year, establishing itself as a representative sports space in Seoul for everybody to enjoy at an

81 preliminary entrepreneurs, resulting in 68 cases of successful business launch. By providing 
proper training, investment arrangements, and follow-up support, our program resulted in the 
creation of 258 new jobs, and attracted KRW 6.4 billion in investment. The number of application 
teams increased each year, and, in 2017, 486 teams applied for the KDB Start-up Program, and we 
selected 30 teams to participate in the final round, offering a diverse range of start-up training and 
mentoring programs. Moreover, we have strived to nurture young talent in start-ups by supporting 
training session since 2017. As such, we are engaged in numerous efforts to spread start-up culture 
among Korean youths.Furthermore, there is a wide range of programs geared 
toward developing skills crucial to tap into new overseas

invited senior public officials from finance ministries and central banks of 13 developing countries 
including ASEAN member nations to participate in a knowledge-sharing program. It served as an 
opportunity to broaden the scope of their understanding of KDB and was conducive to strengthening 
our partnerships with developing countries in Asia. In August 2017, KDB provided lectures on the 
roles and functions of the Bank for 22 intermediate-level managers of the Bank of Investment and 
Development of Vietnam upon request after the signing of an MOU, and organized visits to related 
departments at the Bank.In July 2017, KDB Foundation invited 32 ethnic Korean university students living in Central Asia to the ‘2017 
KDB Global Talent Development Program’. The students who participated in the program were locally 
selected as those with high potential to grow into global leaders.The six-week-long program covered cultural and art experiences as well as leadership training based 
on intensive Korean language courses offered at various levels of proficiency. It consisted of sub-
programs to promote awareness of cultural diversity through an understanding of other cultures and 
communication, as well as the Korean past and the present.KDB will make concerted efforts to promote talent among ethnic Koreans in Central Asia and develop 
them into global talent connecting Korea and the region through continuous and systematic social 
contributions. A total of 188 graduates were generated from the program which was held 8 times as of 
2017, and 30 of the graduates were admitted to prestigious graduate schools in Korea.We have devised training programs in areas where we have expertise, namely PF, M&A, and corporate 
restructuring, for the general public. These programs are open to anyone and provided via KDB 
Academy, created to share our advanced knowledge and experience in the financial services business.KDB set up the KDB e-book Center, adding multimedia features to various publications by the Bank 
including economic/financial/industrial analysis reports, thereby enhancing their utility. By doing so, 
KDB secured a new knowledge-sharing platform with customers by managing publications for external 
usage in e-book format.FINANCIAL

DisCussiOn & AnAlysisThe 2017 financial statements prepared by KDB conform to the Korean International Financial Reporting 
Standards (K-IFRS). K-IFRS refers to what Korea has adopted out of the standards and interpretations released 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The 2017 financial statements of KDB cover financial 
performance from january 1 to December 31 of the year, and the financial figures in this Management’s 
Discussion & Analysis (MD&A), unless specifically indicated, are based on consolidated financial statements.2017 Review 
→2018 Outlook
→The global economy in 2017 witnessed high volatility 
in the global financial market due to three interest-rate 
hikes by the Fed amid the economic turnaround in the U.S. 
and geopolitical risks. The domestic economy in Korea, 
likewise, experienced high market volatility because the 
Bank of Korea raised the base rate for the first time in 
seven years while companies and industries went through 
restructuring. Meanwhile, the operating performance 
of banks, securities firms, and insurers in the domestic 
financial sector improved, but competition gradually 
intensified due to the emergence of Internet-only banks, 
the development of fintech and the launch of full-service 
investment banks.Against this backdrop, KDB has concentrated more of its 
competencies on future growth industries and industries 
associated with the 4th Industrial Revolution to ensure 
the stability and revitalization of the national economy as 
Korea’s representative financial institution. In 2017, KDB 
also encouraged preemptive restructuring for corporate 
groups suffering from a temporary shortage in liquidity 
and took effective financial measures so that crises within 
specific companies would not spread throughout the 
economy.Moreover, KDB focused its competencies on financing 
SMEs and MEs, promoting overseas advancement of 
Korean companies, and forming a start-up ecosystem, 
etc.  In  addition,  KDB  strived  to  secure  growth 
fundamentals for the future by handling overseas 
PF financial arrangements of USD 1.5 billion, while 
establishing the Asia Regional Head Office in Singapore 
as the business hub in Southeast Asia in tandem with the 
government’s New Southern Policy.As a consequence of such efforts, KDB’s prestige as 
a market leader and Korea’s representative financial 
institution, together with its impressive capital adequacy, 
has been comprehensively evaluated by international 
credit rating agencies. In 2017, KDB maintained high credit 
ratings (Moody’s Aa2, S&P AA, and Fitch AA-) and its BIS 
capital ratio also reached 15.26%, up 40bps from 2016.Notwithstanding the overall turnaround in the global 
economy in 2018, financial anxiety and capital mobility 
are likely to increase due to the high likelihood of more 
interest rate hikes in the U.S. and trade protectionism 
possibly leading to cross-national conflicts. According 
to the IMF, the global economy is forecast to continue 
its gradual recovery of 3.9%. The domestic economy is 
expected to show robust growth due to improvements 
in exports and private consumption as a result of an 
economic recovery in major trading partners. However, 
risks still prevail such as a worsening of the trade 
environment and an aggravation of financial conditions 
due to the normalization of monetary policies in major 
economies.Risk factors are also rampant in the domestic financial 
sector, including higher non-performing loans due to 
higher interest rates, intensified regulation of household 
debts, and intensifying competition. In particular, the 
government’s stronger regulations on LTV/DTI and 
introduction of new DTI/DSR regulations to stabilize the 
housing market are expected to have a significant impact 
on the asset/profit structure in the existing financial 
sector.KDB  plans  to  fulfill  its  role  by  transforming  its 
fundamentals  at  a  time  when  the  domestic  and 
international economic situation is gradually improving. 
KDB  will  spearhead  the  era  of  the  4th  Industrial 
Revolution, reinvigorating the national economy as well 
as raising risk management capabilities to withstand risks 
while providing a market safety net.In 2018, KDB will strive to carry out its role based on 
stable credit ratings, globally competitive financial 
expertise, and thorough risk management, in the face of 
a rapidly changing financial environment. Moreover, KDB 
will facilitate a rebound of the national economy by taking 
the lead in advancing the financial industry as well as 
backing the push for globalization.51INCOME ANALYSISSummary Statement of IncomeNet operating revenueNet interest incomeNon-interest incomeProvision for loan lossG&A expensesOperating incomeNon-operating incomeIncome tax expenseProfit from discontinued operationsNet profit(Unit: KRW billion)20172016ChangeAmount(%)3,534.62,254.31,280.3977.01,790.3767.3778.4982.3-1,456.02,043.7(587.7)2,684.41,925.8(3,145.3)1,916.31,118.4294.8563.4(2,061.6)2,078.6210.61,868.0(1,707.4)(135.5)3,921.6(1,137.9)(136.1)(294.8)2,625.0142.810.3-(63.6)(7.0)-(59.4)(12.2)(100.0)-In terms of net income, after recording a net loss of KRW 2,062 billion in 2016, KDB recorded a net profit of KRW 563

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 
(In millions of won) 
 
2.     Basis of Preparation(1) Application of accounting standards 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Korean  International  Financial 
Reporting Standards (“K-IFRS”) enacted by the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies.  
 
(2) Changes and disclosures of accounting policies 
(i) New and amended standards and interpretations adopted 
The Group newly applied the following amended and enacted standards for the annual period beginning on January 
1, 2017. Application of these amendment and improvements dose not have a material impact on its consolidated 
financial statements.  
 
-  Amendments to K-IFRS 1007 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ 
-  Amendments to K-IFRS 1012 ‘Income Taxes’ 
-  Amendments to K-IFRS 1112 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ 
 
 (ii) New and amended standards and interpretations issued but not effective 
The following new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been published but not 
effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2017, and the Group has not early adopted them.  
 
K-IFRS 1109 ‘Financial Instruments’ 
K-IFRS  1109  ‘Financial  Instruments’  replaces  the  existing  guidance  in  K-IFRS  1039  ‘Financial  Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’. The Group plans to adopt K-IFRS 1109 for the accounting periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2018.  
 
K-IFRS 1109 is retrospectively applied in principle, but there are some exceptions such as exemption of restatement 
of  comparative  information  for  classification,  measurement,  impairment  of  financial  instruments.  For  hedge 
accounting, the requirements are generally applied prospectively, with some exceptions such as accounting for time 
value of options.  
 
Major characteristics of K-IFRS 1109 are financial assets being classified and measured based on the holder’s 
business model and instrument’s contractual cash flow characteristics, impairment model of financial instruments 
based on expected credit losses (ECL), broader range of hedged items and hedging instruments that qualify for the 
application of hedge accounting or changes in evaluation of hedging effectiveness etc.  
 
For smooth adoption of K-IFRS 1109, financial impact analysis, accounting policies establishment, accounting 
system establishment and stabilization need to take place. The impact of the standards on the financial statements 
in the period they are initially adopted may differ depending on the Group’s decisions and judgments of accounting 
policies as well as economic environment and its financial instruments.  
 
With the implementation of Korea IFRS 1109, the Bank completed modification of its internal managing processes 
or accounting system for financial instruments reporting and the Group is in the process of analyzing the financial 
impact of the new standard on the consolidated financial statements. The Bank performed an impact assessment to 
identify potential financial impacts of applying K-IFRS 1109. The assessment was performed based on available 
information as at December 31, 2017, and the results of the assessment are explained as below.1670Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 
(In millions of won) 
 
2.     Basis of Preparation, ContinuedThe general impacts on the consolidated financial statements are as follows: 
 
Classification and measurement of financial assets 
K-IFRS 1109 requires a financial asset to be classified and measured subsequently at amortized cost, fair value 
through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) based on the holder’s 
business model and instrument’s contractual cash flow characteristics as shown below. If a hybrid contract contains 
a host that is a financial asset, an embedded derivative is not separated from the host and the entire hybrid contract 
is classified according to the requirement of K-IFRS 1109.Contractual cash flow characteristicsBusiness modelObjective of collecting contractualcash flowsObjective of collecting contractual 
cash flows and selling financial 
assetsaccounting mismatch.Composed solely of  
principal and interestMeasured at amortized cost (*1)Measured at FVOCI (*1)OtherMeasured at FVTPL (*2)Objective of selling or others 
(*1)  Financial  assets  may  be  irrevocably  designated  as  measured  at  FVTPL  in  order  to  eliminate  or  reduceMeasured at FVTPL(*2) Investment in equity instruments not held for trading may be irrevocably designated as measured at FVOCI.  
 
The requirements of K-IFRS 1109 to classify financial assets as measured at amortized costs or FVOCI are more 
stringent than those of K-IFRS 1039, and thus, the proportion of financial assets measured at FVTPL may increase, 
which may lead to a rise in volatility of profit or loss because of the adoption of K-IFRS 1109.  
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Bank holds W150,203,457 million of loans and receivables, W12,313 million of 
held-to-maturity financial assets, W32,062,921 million of available-for-sale financial assets and W926,737 million 
of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss excluding derivative financial assets. 
 
According to K-IFRS 1109, a debt instrument may be measured at amortised cost if both of the conditions that the 
instrument is held within a business model whose objective is to hold instruments in order to collect contractual 
cash flows and that the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are met. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank 
holds  loans  and  receivables  and  held-to-maturity  financial  assets  measured  at  amortised  cost  amounting  to 
W150,203,457 million and W12,313 million, respectively. 
 
According  to  K-IFRS  1109,  a  debt  instrument  may  be  measured  at  FVOCI  if  both  of  the  conditions  that  the 
instrument is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows 
and selling instruments and that the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are met. As of December 31, 
2017, the Bank holds debt instruments classified as available-for-sale financial assets amounting to W17,609,058 
million. 
 
According to K-IFRS 1109, an entity may make an irrevocable election at initial recognition to present in other 
comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value of an investment in an equity instrument that is not 
held for trading and the gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are not subsequently recycled 
to  profit  or  loss.  As  of  December  31,  2017,  the  Bank  holds  equity  instruments  classified  as  available-for-sale 
financial assets amounting to W14,453,863 million. 
 
According to K-IFRS 1109, a debt instrument that is held for trading or whose contractual terms do not give rise 
to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and an equity 
instrument not designated as measured at FVOCI is measured at FVTPL. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank holds 
debt and equity instruments classified as financial assets at FVTPL amounting to W911,203 million and W15,534 
million, respectively.1771Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 
 
 
2.     Basis of Preparation, ContinuedWhen applying K-IFRS 1109, W707,816 million of loans and receivables and W4,216,878 million of available-
for-sale financial assets measured at amortised cost as of December 31, 2017 would be classified as financial assets 
at FVTPL. As a result, the proportion of financial assets measured at FVTPL of total financial assets (excluding 
derivatives) will increase from 0.51% to 3.28%, and the volatility of profit or loss resulting from changes in the 
fair value of financial assets will increase. 
 
Classification and measurement of financial liabilities 
K-IFRS 1109 requires that the amount of change in fair value of the financial liability designated as measured at 
FVTPL that is attributable to changes in the credit risk shall be presented in other comprehensive income and the 
amount shall not be reclassified as profit or loss. If the requirements create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in 
profit or loss, all gains or losses on that liability including the effects of changes in the credit risk shall be presented 
in profit or loss.  
 
In K-IFRS 1039, the entire change in fair value of the financial liability designated as  measured at FVTPL is 
presented in profit or loss. In K-IFRS 1109, the profit or loss related to the financial liability may be decreased 
because a portion of the change in fair value is presented in other comprehensive income  
 
As  of  December  31,  2017,  the  Bank  has  designated  W1,583,713  million  of  financial  liabilities  amounting  to 
W181,566,313 million excluding derivatives as measured at FVTPL. 
 
When applying K-IFRS 1109, the accumulated amount of change in fair value of the financial liabilities that is 
attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability as of December 31, 2017 would be W13,131 million and 
profit or loss relating to valuation of the financial liability is expected to decrease slightly. 
 
Impairment: financial assets and contract assets 
In K-IFRS 1039, impairment is recognized only when there is objective evidence of impairment based on incurred 
loss  model.  In  K-IFRS  1109,  impairment  of  debt  instruments  measured  at  amortized  costs  or  FVOCI,  lease 
receivables,  contract  assets,  loan  commitments  and  financial  guarantee  contracts  is  recognized  based  on  the 
expected credit loss (ECL) impairment model.  
 
K-IFRS 1109 outlines a ‘three-stage’ model for impairment based on changes in credit risk since initial recognition. 
A loss allowance is measured based on the 12-month ECL or life-time ECL which allows early recognition of 
credit loss compared to the incurred loss model of K-IFRS 1039.Stage 1Stage 2ClassificationAssets  with  no  significant  increase  incredit risk since initial recognitionAssets with significant increase in creditrisk since initial recognitionLoss allowance12-month  ECL:  Expected  credit  losses  that  result  from

Hedge accounting 
K-IFRS 1109 maintains mechanics of hedge accounting (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge and a hedge of a net 
investment in a foreign operation) as set forth in K-IFRS 1039. However, unlike requirements in K-IFRS 1039 that 
are too complex and strict, K-IFRS 1109 is more practical, principle based and less strict and focuses on the entity’s 
risk management activities. Also, K-IFRS 1109 allows broader range of hedged items and hedging instruments. 
Under  K-IFRS  1039,  a  hedge  is  assessed  to  be  highly  effective  only  if  the  offset  is  in  the  range  of  80-125 
percentages by performing numerical test of effectiveness. In K-IFRS 1109, such requirements are alleviated.  
 
Transactions  not  qualifying  for  hedge  accounting  requirements  of  K-IFRS  1039  may  now  qualify  for  hedge 
accounting under K-IFRS 1109, resulting in less volatility of profit or loss. 
 
Pursuant to transitional provisions of hedge accounting, the Bank may choose as its accounting policy to continue 
to apply the hedge accounting requirements of K-IFRS 1039 at the date of initial application. 
 
K-IFRS 1115 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 
K-IFRS  1115  ‘Revenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers’  replaces  the  existing  guidance  in  K-IFRS  1011 
‘Construction Contracts’, K-IFRS 1018 ‘Revenue’, K-IFRS 2113 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’, K-IFRS 2115 
‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’, K-IFRS 2118 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’ and K-IFRS 
2031 ‘Revenue - Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services’. 
 
The  Group  shall  apply  K-IFRS  1115  for  annual  reporting  periods  beginning  on  or  after  January  1,  2018,  and 
recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the  standard as an adjustment to  retained earnings as of 
January 1, 2018. 
 
Current K-IFRSs provide revenue recognition standards for different types of transactions, such as sales of goods, 
provision of services, interest income, royalty income, dividend income and construction contracts. The K-IFRS 
1115 introduces a five-step approach to revenue recognition and  measurement for all types of transactions: 1) 
Identify the contract with a customer, 2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract, 3) Determine the 
transaction price, 4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5) Recognize 
revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 
 
For the preparation of implementing K-IFRS 1115, the Group is in the process of analysing financial impact arising 
from applying the standard with an accounting firm which serves as an external advisor. The revenue of Daewoo 
Shipbuilding  &  Marine  Engineering  Co.,  Ltd.  (“DSME”)  and  Daewoo  Engineering  &  Construction  Co.,  Ltd. 
(“Daewoo E&C”) of the Group’s subsidiaries are expected to be affected in general. 
 
DSME and Daewoo E&C have performed preliminary impact assessment for the financial statements for the year 
ended  December  31,  2017  based  on  information  available  as  at  October  30,  2017  and  December  31,  2017, 
respectively.  The  result  of  preliminary  impact  assessment  may  be  changed  based  on  additional  information 
available subsequently.2074Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 
 
 
2.     Basis of Preparation, ContinuedThe preliminary impact assessment for DSME is as follows: 
 
① Identify the performance obligations in the contract 
The DSME operates divisions of the ships & offshore plant, special ships and others. 
 
Under K-IFRS 1115, timing of revenue recognition would change depending on whether each of the performance 
obligations are satisfied at a point of time or over time. 
 
As DSME has the performance obligation of the construction of a vessel, etc. ordered by customers, it  would 
recognize revenue with transaction price over the service period. As a result of a preliminary impact assessment of 
the adoption of K-IFRS 1115, the DSME’s revenue recognition can be affected. 
 
② Measuring progress using the input method 
Under K-IFRS 1115, a faithful depiction of an entity’s performance might be to recognize revenue at an amount 
equal to the cost of goods used to satisfy a performance obligation if the entity expects at contract inception that 1) 
a good is not distinct, 2) a customer is expected to obtain control of the good significantly before receiving services 
related  to  the  good,  3)  the  cost  of  the  transferred  good  is  significantly  relative  to  the  total  expected  costs  to 
completely satisfy the performance obligation, and 4) the entity procures the good from a third party and is not 
significantly involved in designing and manufacturing the good. As a result of a preliminary impact assessment of 
the adoption of K-IFRS 1115, the DSME’s revenue recognition can be affected. 
 
③ Variable consideration 
The DSME’s consideration received from customers can be variable due to the liquidated damages arising from 
delays, change order, etc. 
 
Under K-IFRS 1115, the entity shall estimate an amount of variable consideration by using the expected value 
method the entity expects to better predict an amount of consideration to which it will be entitled and include the 
amount of variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant 
reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the 
variable consideration is subsequently resolved. As a result of a preliminary impact assessment of the adoption of 
K-IFRS 1115, the DSME’s revenue recognition can be affected. 
 
④ Significant financing component in the contract 
Currently, the heavy-tail payment method, in which a substantial portion of the payment is made at time of delivery, 
is diffusing in the shipbuilding industry.  
 
Under  K-IFRS  1115,  in  determining  the  transaction  price,  the  entity  shall  adjust  the  promised  amount  of 
consideration for the efforts of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the 
contract provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services 
to the customer. 
 
DSME will not adjust the promised amount of consideration if it expects that the period between when it transfers 
a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or 
less. As a result of a preliminary impact assessment of the adoption of K-IFRS 1115, DSME’s revenue may be 
varied due to significant financing component.2175Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 
 
 
2.     Basis of Preparation, Continued⑤ Warranties 
The DSME provides one-year extended warranties for certain projects, besides the standard warranties providing a 
customer with assurance that a product complies with the agreed-upon contract. Under K-IFSR 1115, the extended 
warranties are the distinct services. 
 
Under K-IFRS 1115, if a warranty provides a customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the product 
complies with agreed-upon specifications, the promised service is a separate performance obligation and the related 
transaction price needs to be allocated to the product and the service. 
 
As a result of a preliminary impact assessment of the adoption of K-IFRS 1115, the DSME’s retained earnings is 
expected to decrease as some part of transaction price is allocated to the warranties and the allocated transaction 
price is recognized as revenue based on the allocated transaction price upon satisfying the performance obligation. 
 
The preliminary impact assessment for Daewoo E&C is as follows: 
 
① Performance obligation satisfied over time 
The  Daewoo  E&C  provides  customers  with  roads,  bridges,  apartments,  shopping  malls,  power  generation  and 
petrochemical plants through the process of design, procurement and construction and the process generally takes 
three to four years. 
 
As  a  result  of  a preliminary  impact  assessment  of  the  adoption  of  K -IFRS  1115,  the  revenue  from  most  of 
construction contracts may be recognized based on percentage-of-completion accounting. The Daewoo E&C will 
recognize revenue over time based on percentage of completion considering the actual costs incurred. 
 
Meanwhile, the Daewoo E&C continues to analyse the impact on the timing of revenue recognition of presale 
construction under K-IFRS 1115. 
 
② Incremental costs of obtaining a contract 
The Daewoo E&C recognizes as an asset the costs to obtain a construction contract with a customer and the costs 
includes those costs that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. In accordance with K-
IFRS 1115, an entity shall recognize as an asset the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the 
entity expects to recover those costs, and costs recognized as assets are amortized over the contract period. As a 
practical expedient, the entity can recognize those costs as expenses when incurred if the amortisation period of the 
asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. The Daewoo E&C is in the process of 
analysing  the  financial  impact  and  the  result  will  be  reflected  in  the  financial  statements  for  the  year  ending 
December 31, 2018.  
 
③ Significant financing component in the contract 
Under K-IFRS 1115, in determining the transaction price, an entity recognizes revenue at an amount that reflects 
the price that a customer would have paid in cash for the promised goods or services when they transfer to the 
customer if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract provides the customer or the entity with 
a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer. The Daewoo E&C is in the 
process of analysing the financial impact and the result will be reflected in the financial statements for the year 
ending December 31, 2018.2276Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

2.     Basis of Preparation, ContinuedK-IFRS 1116 ‘Leases’ 
K-IFRS  ‘Leases’  1116  replaces  K-IFRS  1017  ‘Leases’,  K-IFRS  2104  ‘Determines  whether  an  Arrangement 
contains a Lease’, K-IFRS 2015 ‘Operating Leases-Incentives’ and K-IFRS 2027 ‘Evaluating the Substance of 
Transactions  Involving  the  Legal  Form  of  a  Lease’.  K-IFRS  1116  sets  out  the  principles  for  the  recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-
balance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under KIFRS 1017. The standard includes two 
recognition exemptions for lessees – leases of ’low-value’ assets (e.g., personal computers) and short-term leases 
(i.e., leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). K-IFRS 1116 is effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after  January  1,  2019  and  early  application  is  permitted.  The  Group  is  assessing  the  potential  effect  of  the 
amendments on its consolidated financial statements. 
 
Amendments to Korean IFRS 1028 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ 
When an investment in an associate or a joint venture is held by, or it held indirectly through, an entity that is a 
venture capital organization,  a  mutual fund, etc., the entity  may elect to  measure that investment at  fair value 
through profit or loss. The amendments clarify that an entity shall make this election separately for each associate 
of joint venture, at initial recognition of the associate or joint venture. The Group will apply these amendments 
retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Group 
does not expect the amendments to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
 
K-IFRS 1102 ‘Share-based Payment’ 
Amendment to K-IFRS 1102 clarifies the accounting for a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-
based payment that changes the classification of the transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled and valuation 
method  used  to  measure  fair  value  of  cash-settled  share-based  payment.  The  amendment  to  K-IFRS  1102  is 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Group expects 
that the application of this amendment would not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
 
Enactments to Interpretation 2122 ‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration’ 
According to these enactments, the date of the transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use 
on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it) is the date on which an entity initially 
recognizes  the  non-monetary  asset  or  non-monetary  liability  arising  from  the  payment  or  receipt  of  advance 
consideration.  If  there  are  multiple  payments  or  receipts  in  advance,  the  entity  shall  determine  a  date  of  the 
transaction for each payment or receipt of advance consideration. These enactments will be effective for annual 
periods  beginning  on  or  after  January  1,  2018,  with  early  adoption  permitted.  The  Group  does  not  expect  the 
enactments to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with K-IFRS requires management to make 
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts 
of  assets,  liabilities,  income  and  expenses.  Management’s  estimates  may  differ  from  actual  outcomes  if 
management’s estimates and assumptions based on management’s best judgment at the reporting date are different 
from the actual environment.  
 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.  
 
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
end of the reporting period that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:  
 
(i) Fair value of financial instruments 
Financial  instruments  held-for-trading,  financial  instruments  designated  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss, 
available-for-sale  financial  assets  and  derivative  instruments  are  recognized  and  measured  at  fair  value.  If  the 
market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is determined either by using a valuation technique or 
independent  third-party  valuation  service.  Valuation  techniques  include  using  recent  arm's  length  market 
transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, if available, referencing to the current fair value of another 
instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.Financial instruments, which are not actively traded in the market and those with less transparent market prices, 
will have less objective fair values and require broad judgment on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty in market 
factors and assumptions in price determination and other risks.  
 
Diverse valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, from generally accepted 
market valuation models to internally developed valuation models that incorporate various types of assumptions 
and variables.24(ii)  Provisions  for  credit  losses  (allowances  for  loan  losses,  provisions  for  payment  guarantee,  and  unused 
commitments) 
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are 
individually significant (individual assessment of impairment). Financial assets that are not individually significant 
assess objective evidence of impairment individually or collectively. If the Group determines that no objective 
evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the 
asset  in  a  group  of  financial  assets  with  similar  credit  risk  characteristics  and  collectively  assesses  them  for 
impairment (collective assessment of impairment).  
 
Provisions for credit losses are measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value 
of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.  
 
Individual assessment of impairment losses is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows of a loan at 
its original effective interest rate and comparing the resultant present value with the loan’s current carrying amount. 
This process normally encompasses management’s best estimate, such as operating cash flow of the borrower and 
net realizable value of any collateral held.  
 
A methodology based on historical loss experience is used to estimate inherent incurred loss on groups of assets for 
collective assessment of impairment. Such methodology incorporates factors such as type of collateral, product and 
borrowers, credit rating, loss emergence period, recovery period and applies probability of default on a group of 
assets  and  loss  given  default  by  type  of  recovery  method.  Also,  consistent  assumptions  are  applied  to  form  a 
formula-based model in estimating inherent loss and to determine factors on the basis of historical loss experience 
and  current  condition.  The  methodology  and  assumptions  used  for  collective  assessment  of  impairment  are 
reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.  
 
(iii) Deferred taxes 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset 
is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date. Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that sufficient taxable profit will be 
available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Actual income taxes in the future may not be 
identical to the recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities, 
 
(iv) Defined benefit liabilities 
The Group operates a defined benefit plan. Defined benefit liability is calculated by annual actuarial valuations as 
of the reporting date. In order to perform the actuarial valuations, assumptions for discount rates, future salary 
increases  and  others  are  required  to  be  estimated.  Defined  benefit  plans  contain  significant  uncertainties  in 
estimations due to its long-term nature.  
 
(6) Approval date for the consolidated financial statements 
The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on March 28, 2018, 
which will be submitted for approval to the shareholders’ meeting to be held on March 29, 2018.78Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

3.     Significant Accounting PoliciesThe significant accounting policies applied by the Group in preparation of its consolidated financial statements are 
included below. The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in 
these consolidated financial statements.(1) Basis of consolidation 
(i) Subsidiaries and business combinations 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has right 
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
of the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the 
date on which control commences until the date on which controls ceases.  
 
If  a  subsidiary  of  the  Group  uses  accounting  policies  other  than  those  adopted  in  the  consolidated  financial 
statements  for  like  transactions  and  events  in  similar  circumstances,  appropriate  adjustments  are  made  to  its 
financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements.  
 
For acquisitions meeting the definition of a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting is used.  
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Any goodwill arising from initial consolidation is tested for 
impairment at least once a year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for impairment. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition 
date in fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed and the 
amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquire. Costs related to acquisition are recognized as expenses when 
occurred.  
 
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired 
is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets 
acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  
 
Intra-group  balances,  income  and  expenses,  unrealized  gain  and  loss  and  dividends  resulting  from  intra-group 
transactions are fully eliminated 
 
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary,  without a change of control, is accounted  for as an equity 
transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it recognizes any investment retained at fair value and any 
surplus or deficit in profit or loss.2680Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(ii) Investments in associates 
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Significant influence is 
presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power. Investments in associates are 
accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognized at cost. The Group’s investment in 
associates  includes  goodwill  (net  of  any  accumulated  impairment  loss)  identified  on  acquisition.  When  the 
investors’ share on the fair value of the associates’ identifiable assets and liabilities exceeds acquisition cost of the 
associates’ interest, the excess portion is recognized as the current profit for the year of acquisition.  
 
The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or loss is recognized in the statement of comprehensive 
income, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognized in reserves. When the Group’s share 
of loss in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the 
Group  does  not  recognize  further  loss,  unless  it  has  incurred  obligations  or  made  payments  on  behalf  of  the 
associates. The carrying amount of equity method investments and the long-term interest that partially consists of 
investors’ net investment are included in interest in the associate.  
 
Unrealized gain and loss on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the associate. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.  
 
(iii) Acquisitions from entities under common control 
The  assets  and  liabilities  acquired  are  recognized  at  the  carrying  amounts  recognized  previously  in  the  Group 
controlling shareholder’s consolidated financial  statements. The difference between cash paid and acquired net 
assets are recorded in equity.  
 
(iv) Non-controlling Interests 
Non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are accounted for separately from the parent’s ownership interests in a 
subsidiary. Each component of net profit or loss and other comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the 
parent and non-controlling interest holders, even when the allocation reduces the non-controlling interests balance 
below zero.  
 
(v) Changes in the parent company’s ownership interest  
Changes  in  the  parent  company’s  ownership  interest  in  a  subsidiary  that  do  not  result  in  a  loss  of  control  are 
accounted  for  as  equity  transactions  with  owners  in  their  capacity  as  owners.  Adjustments  to  non-controlling 
interests  are  based  on  a  proportionate  amount  of  the  net  assets  of  the  subsidiary.  The  difference  between  the 
consideration and the adjustments made to non-controlling interests is recognized directly in equity attributable to 
the owners of the parent company.  
 
(2) Operating segments 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn 
revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s 
other components. Segment results that are reported to the chief operating decision maker include items directly 
attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items mainly 
comprise corporate assets (primarily the Group’s headquarters), head office expenses, and income tax assets and 
liabilities. The Group recognizes the CEO as the chief operating decision maker.27Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued81(3) Foreign exchange 
(i) Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of company entities at exchange rates at 
the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date 
are  translated  to  the  functional  currency  at  the  exchange  rate  at  that  date.  Non-monetary  assets  and  liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currency at the 
exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.  
 
Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognized in profit or loss, except for differences arising on 
the  translation  of  available  for  sale  equity  instruments,  a  financial  liability  designated  as  a  hedge  of  the  net 
investment in a foreign operation, or in a qualifying cash flow hedge, which are recognized in other comprehensive 
income. Exchange rate effect of the gain (or loss) from non-monetary item is categorized according to whether the 
gain (or loss) is recognized as other comprehensive income or as profit or loss.  
 
(ii) Foreign operations 
If the presentation currency of the Group is different from a foreign operation’s functional currency, the financial 
statements of the foreign operation are translated into the presentation currency using the following methods: 
 
Unless the functional currency of foreign operations is in a state of hyperinflation, assets and liabilities of foreign 
operations are translated at the closing exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses on 
the statement of comprehensive income are translated at the exchange rates of the date of transaction. Foreign 
currency differences that arise from translation are recognized as other comprehensive income.  
 
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation, and any adjustments in fair value to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities due to such acquisition, are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation. 
Therefore, such are expressed in the functional currency of the foreign operations and, alongside other assets and 
liabilities of the foreign operation, translated at the closing exchange rate.  
 
In the case of the disposal of a foreign operation, cumulative amounts of exchange difference regarding the foreign 
operation, recognized separately from other comprehensive income, are re-categorized from assets to profit or loss 
as of the moment the disposal profit or loss is recognized.  
 
(iii) Foreign exchange of net investment in foreign operations 
Monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, with none or little possibility of being settled in 
the foreseeable future, are considered a part of the net investment in the foreign operation. Therefore, the exchange 
difference is recognized as comprehensive income or loss in the consolidated financial statement, and re-categorized 
to profit or loss as of the disposal of the related net investment.2882Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(4) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with original maturities of or less than three months’ maturity from 
the date of acquisition that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, including cash on hand, 
deposits held at call with banks and other highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three 
months or less.  
 
(5) Non-derivative financial assets 
The  Group recognizes  and  measures  non-derivative  financial  assets  by  the  following  four  categories:  financial 
assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  held-to-maturity  assets,  loans  and  receivables  and  available  for  sale 
financial assets. Moreover, the Group recognizes financial assets in the statement of financial position as of the 
time the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.  
 
Non-derivative financial assets are measured at fair value upon initial recognition and, unless designated at fair 
value through profit or loss, transaction costs directly regarding acquisition and issuance of such assets are summed 
to the initial fair value.  
 
(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Any financial asset classified as held for trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition 
is categorized under financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL) are measured at fair value upon initial recognition, and changes therein are recognized as profit or 
loss. Furthermore, transaction costs regarding acquisition upon initial recognition are recognized as profit or loss 
as incurred.  
 
(ii) Held-to-maturity financial assets 
If a non-derivative financial asset has a fixed maturity with a fixed or determinable payment, and the Group has 
positive intent and ability to hold such an asset, it is classified as held-to-maturity financial assets. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, held-to-maturity financial assets are measured at amortized costs using the effective interest rate 
(“EIR”) method.  
 
(iii) Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using 
the effective interest rate method. Furthermore, the effective interest rate method is applied to recognize interest 
incomes on financial investments, except short-term loans and receivables, in which case the impact of effective 
interest the method is immaterial.  
 
(iv) Available-for-sale financial assets 
Any non-derivative financial asset, not classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-
maturity financial assets, or loans and receivables, is classified as available-for-sale financial assets. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, such assets are measured at fair value. However, equity instruments that do not have a quoted 
market price in an active  market and cannot be reliably  measured, and any derivatives that are linked to these 
instruments and need to be settled upon the delivery of such equity instruments are measured at cost. Accumulated 
other comprehensive income, reflected in equity as fair value changes, is recognized as profit or loss as of the time 
the related available-for-sale  asset is disposed of or the impairment loss is recognized. Furthermore, dividends 
earned  whilst  holding  available-for-sale  financial  assets  are  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statement  of 
comprehensive income upon the establishment of the right to receive the payment.2983Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(v) De-recognition of financial assets 
The Group de-recognizes a financial asset when the rights to receive cash flow from an asset expire, or when it 
transfers the rights to receive cash flow and substantially all the risks and rewards from the ownership of a financial 
asset. In the case that the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of an 
asset, the Group de-recognizes any assets if it does not have control, and recognizes any assets to the extent of the 
Group’s continuing involvement if it does have control. In the latter case, any associated liabilities are recognized 
by the Group. In the case the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards from the ownership of an asset it 
does not have control of, the Group continues to recognize the financial asset, and recognizes consideration received 
as financial liabilities.  
 
(vi) Offsetting between financial assets and financial liabilities 
Financial assets and liabilities are set-off only under the conditions that the Group has legal rights to set-off the 
recognized amounts, and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realize assets and settle liabilities at the same 
time.  
 
(6) Impairment of financial assets 
The Group assesses the possibility of objective evidence that may indicate any impairment of financial assets, except 
those designated at fair value through profit or loss, at each reporting date. A financial asset is defined as impaired 
if, as a result of one or more events after initial recognition, the estimated future cash flow of the asset has been 
affected. However, expected impairments from future events are not recognized, regardless of their likelihood.  
 
Upon the finding of objective evidence to believe an asset is impaired, the impairment is measured and recognized 
in profit or loss as follows, according to the asset category:(i) Impairment of loans and receivables 
The  Group  assesses,  at  each  reporting  date,  whether  objective  evidence  that  indicate  impairment  of  loans  and 
receivables  exist.  If  objective  evidence  shows  that  believe  impairment  has  occurred,  the  amount  of  the  loss  is 
measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated future cash 
flows, discounted using the initial effective interest rate (EIR). Furthermore, the carrying amount of the asset is 
reduced through the use of an allowance account.  
 
All  individually  significant  loans  and  receivables  are  assessed  for  specific  impairment.  Those  found  not  to  be 
specifically impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet identified. 
Loans and receivables that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment by grouping 
together loans and receivables with similar risk characteristics.  
 
In individual assessment, allowances on losses are computed using the discounted expected recoverable value, 
estimated  by  operating  cash  flows  or  collateral  cash  flow;  in  collective  assessment,  allowances  on  losses  are 
computed using statistical methods based on obtainable historical loss experience.  
 
The present value of estimated future cash flows is measured using the loan’s initial EIR. If the loan has a floating 
interest rate, the Group uses the current EIR for the measurement. Future cash flows from collateral are estimated 
at net cash flow from disposal of collateral (deducting transaction cost).For the purpose of a collective assessment of impairment, assets are analysed on the basis of the Group’s internal 
credit rating system that considers credit risk characteristics such as asset type, industry, geographical location, 
collateral type, past-due status and other relevant factors.  
 
Future cash flows of the assets collectively assessed are estimated on the basis of historical loss experience for loans 
with similar credit risk characteristics. Historical loss experience is adjusted on the basis of current observable data 
to reflect the effects of current conditions on which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the effects 
of conditions in the historical period that no longer exist. Estimates of changes in future cash flows reflect, and are 
directionally  consistent  with,  changes  in  related  observable  data  from  year  to  year  (such  as  changes  in 
unemployment  rates,  property  prices,  commodity  prices,  payment  status,  or  other  factors  that  are  indicative  of 
incurred loss in the Group and their magnitude). The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash 
flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.3084Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 
 
 
3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(ii) Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets 
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether objective evidence that indicate impairment of available-for-
sale assets exist. If such objective evidence exists, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the 
acquisition cost and the current fair value.  
 
An available-for-sale financial asset is considered to be impaired if there is a significant or prolonged decline in fair 
value of the asset below the acquisition cost. The Group considers a 30% to be significant and a period of six months 
to be prolonged.  
 
Impairment loss on equity securities are not reversed through profit or loss. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value 
of a debt instrument increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment 
loss was recognized in, the impairment loss is reversed through the statement of comprehensive income. Moreover, 
the impairment loss is directly reduced from the carrying amount of the financial assets available-for-sale financial 
assets.(iii) Impairment of held-to-maturity financial assets 
The Group assesses individually, at each reporting date, whether there is objective evidence that a held-to-maturity 
financial asset is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the amount of loss is measured as the difference between 
the carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, which is discounted using the initial EIR, 
and recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a financial 
asset  held-to-maturity  increases  and  the  increase  can  be  objectively  related  to  an  event  occurring  after  the 
impairment  was  recognized,  the  impairment  loss  is  reversed  through  the  statement  of  comprehensive  income. 
Moreover, the impairment loss is directly reduced from the carrying amount of the financial asset held-to-maturity 
financial assets.(iv) Loss events of financial assets 
Objective evidences that a financial asset is impaired include the following loss events: 
 
-  Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor 
-  A breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments 
-  The granting of a concession to the borrower, for economic or legal reasons, that the lender would not otherwiseconsider-  A state with high probability that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization 
-  The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset due to financial difficulties 
-  The presence of observable data indicating a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows of a group 
of financial assets since the initial recognition of the group, although the decrease cannot yet be identified with 
the individual financial asset within the group31Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued85(7) Derivative financial instruments including hedge accounting 
Derivative instruments are initially recognized at the fair value upon agreement of the contract, and re-estimated at 
fair value subsequently. The recognition of profit or loss due to changes in fair value of derivative instruments is as 
stated below: 
 
(i) Hedge accounting 
Derivative instruments are accounted differently depending on whether or not hedge accounting is applied, and 
therefore, are classified into trading purpose derivatives and hedging purpose derivatives.  
Upon the transaction of hedging purpose derivatives, two different hedge accounting are applied; a fair value hedge, 
and a cash flow hedge. A fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset 
or  liability  or  an  unrecognized  firm  commitment,  or  an  identified  portion  of  such  an  asset,  liability  or  firm 
commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss. A cash flow hedge is a hedge of 
the exposure to variability in cash flows that (i) is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset 
or  liability  (such  as  all  or  some  future  interest  payments  on  variable  rate  debt)  or  a  highly  probable  forecast 
transaction and (ii) could affect profit or loss. For trading purpose derivatives transaction, changes in the fair value 
of derivatives are recognized in net income.  
 
At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedged item and 
the hedging instrument, including the nature of the risk, the objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and 
the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. Also, at the inception of the 
hedge relationship, a formal assessment is undertaken to ensure the hedging instrument is expected to be highly 
effective in offsetting the designated risk in the hedged item and actual result was so.  
 
Fair value hedge 
For designated and qualifying fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of a hedging derivative is recognized 
in profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. Meanwhile, the change in the fair value of the hedged 
item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognized 
in profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. When the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, the hedge relationship is terminated. For hedged item recorded at amortized cost, the difference between 
the carrying value of the hedged item on termination and the face value is amortized over the remaining term of the 
original hedge using the EIR.  
 
Cash flow hedge 
For designated and qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of gain or loss on the hedging instruments is 
initially  recognized  directly  in  equity.  The  ineffective  portion  of  the  gain  or  loss  on  the  hedging  instrument  is 
recognized immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. When the hedged cash flow affects the profit 
or  loss  in  statement  of  comprehensive  income,  the  gain  or  loss  on  the  hedging  instrument  is  recorded  in  the 
corresponding income or expense line in profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. When a hedge 
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains 
in equity and is recognized when the hedged forecasted transaction is ultimately recognized in the statement of 
comprehensive income. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain and loss 
that  was  reported  in  equity  is  immediately  transferred  to  profit  or  loss  in  the  consolidated  statement  of 
comprehensive income.  
 
(ii) Embedded derivative instruments 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives. The 
Group records embedded derivative instruments at fair value if their economic characteristics and risks are not 
clearly and closely related to those of the host contract. If the embedded derivative cannot be measured separately 
from the host contract, the Group aggregately designates the host contract and embedded derivative as a financial 
instrument at fair value through profit or loss. Changes due to the fair value assessment of embedded derivative 
instruments are recognized in profit or loss.  
 
(iii) Other derivative financial instruments 
Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  other  derivative  financial  instrument  not  designated  as  a  hedging  instrument  are 
recognized immediately in profit or loss.3286Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 
 
 
3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(8) Fair value of financial instruments 
The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets is determined by referencing quoted market 
prices at each reporting date. For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined 
using  appropriate  valuation  techniques.  Such  techniques  may  include  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  or  other 
valuation methods.  
 
The Group’s policies for measuring fair value of financial instruments at amortized costs are as follows: 
 
-  Cash and due from banks: Fair value of cash is considered equivalent to the carrying amount. In the case of due 
from banks on demand, which do not have a set maturity and can be realized instantly, the carrying amount is 
considered to be a close estimate of the fair value and is assumed so. In the case of other ordinary due from banks, 
the cash flow discount method is used to estimate the fair value.-  Loans:  The  fair  value  of  loans  is  the  expected  future  cash  flows,  reflecting  premature  redemption  ratio, 
discounted  by  the  market  interest  rate,  adjusted  by  a  spread  sheet  considering  the  probability  of  default. 
Exceptions to this method include loans with credit line facilities, loans with a maturity of three months or less 
left and impaired loans, which the Group assumes the carrying amount as the fair value.-  Held-to-maturity  financial  assets:  The  fair  value  of  held-to-maturity  financial  assets  is  computed  by  widelyaccepted appraisal agencies upon request.-  Deposits: The fair value of deposits is computed using the discounted cash flow method. However, for deposits,whose cash flows cannot be estimated reasonably, the Group assumes the carrying amount as the fair value.-  Borrowings: For borrowings in Korean won, the fair value is computed using the discounted cash flow method. 
For borrowings in  foreign currency, the  fair  value is computed by  widely accepted appraisal agencies upon 
request.-  Debentures: The fair value of industrial financial debentures in Korean won, except structured debentures in 
Korean won, is computed using the discounted cash flow method. For structured industrial financial debentures 
in Korean won and industrial financial debentures in foreign currency, the fair value is computed by widely 
accepted appraisal agencies upon request.-  Other financial assets and liabilities: The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities is computed using the 
discounted cash flow method. However, in cases cash flow cannot be estimated reasonably, the Group assumes 
the carrying amount as the fair value.(9) Day one profit or loss recognition 
For financial instruments classified as level 3 on the fair value level hierarchy measured using assess variables not 
observable in the market, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price, which 
is equivalent to Day one profit or loss, is amortized by using the straight line method over time.3387Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(10) Lease 
The classification of leases is based on the extent to which risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased 
asset lie with the lessor and the lessee.  
 
(i) Finance lease 
Leases of assets where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases, and the Group presents them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Also, 
initial  direct  cost  that  includes  directly  and  additionally  incurred  commission  fee,  legal  expenses,  and  internal 
accrued costs are included in finance lease receivables. The Group accounts for lease payment by apportioning into 
finance  lease  receivables  and  interest  revenue,  and  interest  revenue  is  recognized  using  the  EIR  method  on 
uncollected finance lease net investment.  
 
(ii) Operating lease 
A lease is classified as operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership,  and  the  related  asset  is  presented  as  acquisition  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation.  Moreover,  the 
minimum lease payment excluding guaranteed residual value is recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over 
the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred by lessors in negotiating and arranging an operating lease shall be added 
to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized as an expense over the lease term, and the depreciation 
policy  for depreciable leased assets  shall be consistent  with the lessors’  normal depreciation policy  for similar 
assets.  
 
(11) Property and equipment 
The Group’s property and equipment is recognized at the carrying amount as historical costs less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment in value. Historical costs include the expenditures directly related to the 
acquisition of assets.  
 
Subsequent  costs  are  recognized  in  the  carrying  amount  of  assets  or,  if  appropriate,  as  separate  assets  if  the 
probabilities future economic benefits associated with the assets will flow into the Group and the costs can be 
measured reliably; the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. Furthermore, any other repairs or 
maintenances are charged to profit or loss as incurred.  
 
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method to the amount of 
residual value less acquisition cost over the following estimated useful lives:TypeBuildings 
Structure 
Leasehold improvements 
Vehicles 
Equipment 
Other propertiesUseful lives (years)12 ~ 60 
10 ~ 514 
44 ~ 8 
2 ~ 40Property  and  equipment  are  impaired  when  its  carrying  amount  exceeds  the  recoverable  amount.  The  Group 
assesses residual value and economic life of its assets at each reporting date and makes adjustments to its useful life 
when necessary. Any gain or loss arising from the disposal of the asset (calculated as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is recognized in non-operating income (expense) in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income.3488Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(12) Investment property 
The  Group  classifies  property  held  for  the  purpose  of  rental  income  or  benefits  from  capital  appreciation  as 
investment property. Investment property is measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, the cost model is applied. Subsequent to initial recognition, an item of investment property is 
carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss.  
 
Investment properties are derecognized either when they have been disposed of or when the investment property is 
permanently  withdrawn  from use and no future economic  benefit is expected from its disposal. The difference 
between  the  net  disposal  proceeds  and  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  is  recognized  in  the  statement  of 
comprehensive income in the period of de-recognition. Reclassification to or from other account is made if there is 
a change in use of corresponding investment property.  
 
Depreciation of investment property is calculated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives as 
follows:TypeBuildings 
StructureUseful lives (years)20 ~ 50 
10 ~ 40(13) Intangible assets 
An intangible asset is recognized only when its cost can be measured reliably, and the probabilities future economic 
benefits from the asset will flow into the Group are high. Separately acquired intangible assets are recognized at the 
acquisition  cost,  and  subsequently,  the  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated  impairment  is 
recognized as the carrying amount.  
 
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the 4-year to 30-year period of useful economic lives using the 
straight line method. At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews intangible assets for any evidence that 
indicate impairment, and upon the presence of such evidence, the Group estimates the amount recoverable and 
recognizes the loss accordingly. Intangible assets are derecognized either when they have been disposed of or when 
the intangible assets are permanently  withdrawn from  use and no future economic benefit is expected from its 
disposal.  
  
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually. Furthermore, 
the Group reviews such intangible assets to determine whether it is appropriate to consider these assets to have 
indefinite useful lives. If in the case the Group concludes an asset is not qualified to be classified as non-finite, 
prospective measures are taken to consider such an asset as finite.  
 
Expenditures on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge 
and understanding, are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Development expenditures are capitalized only if 
development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future 
economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and 
to use or sell the asset. Other development expenditures are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.3589Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(14) Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Group tests for any evidence of impairment in assets and reviews whether the impairment has taken place by 
estimating the recoverable amount, at the end of each reporting period. The Group estimates the recoverable amount 
of each asset or a whole cash-generating unit unless it is possible to estimate the amount of the asset in that unit. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost and value in use, of an asset. The Group recognizes 
the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount of the asset as an impairment loss if the 
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.  
 
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business is allocated to each cash-generating unit that is expected to 
gain the benefits of the synergy effect. Impairment on cash-generating unit deducts other assets in proportion to 
their carrying amounts after deducting the carrying amount of goodwill allocated in that unit. Impairment loss on 
goodwill cannot be reversed once it is recognized.  
 
Except for impairment losses in respect of goodwill that are never reversed, an impairment loss is reversed if there 
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The reversal is limited so that the 
carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceeds the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.  
 
(15) Assets held for sale 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through 
continuing use, are classified as held for sale. In order to be classified as held for sale, the asset (or disposal groups) 
must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable. The assets (or 
disposal groups) that are classified as assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and 
fair value less cost to sell.  
 
The Group recognizes an impairment loss for any initial or subsequent write-down of an asset (or disposal groups) 
to fair value less costs to sell, and a gain for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell, up to the 
cumulative impairment loss previously recognized.  
 
Non-current assets that are classified as held for sale or part of a disposal group classified as held for sale are not 
depreciated (or amortized).  
 
(16) Non-derivative financial liabilities 
The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
or other financial liabilities in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of 
financial liability. The Group recognizes these financial liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position 
when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial liability.  
 
(i) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in the current year include financial liabilities held for trading 
and  financial  liabilities  designated  at  FVTPL  upon  initial  recognition.  Financial  liabilities  and  derivatives  are 
classified as financial instruments held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of repurchasing in the near 
future. Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at FVTPL upon initial recognition, if the profit or 
loss  from  the  liabilities  indicates  to  be  more  purpose-appropriate  to  be  recognized  as  profit  or  loss.  Financial 
liabilities at FVTPL are designated at fair value in subsequent measurements, and any related un-realized profit or 
loss is recognized as profit or loss.3690Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 
 
 
3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(ii) Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost 
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are recognized at fair value less cost less transaction cost upon initial 
recognition, and subsequently at amortized costs. The difference between the proceeds (net of transaction cost) and 
the redemption value is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income over the periods of the liabilities 
using the EIR.  
 
Fees paid on the establishment of a loan facility are recognized as transaction costs of the loan, if the probability 
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down is high. The amount is deferred until the financial liability would 
be withdrawn. If, however, there is not enough evidence to conclude a draw-down of some or all of the facility will 
occur, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortized over the period of the facility to 
which it relates.(iii) De-recognition of financial liabilities 
A financial liability is de-recognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or 
the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-
recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value 
of the original financial liability and the consideration paid is recognized in profit or loss.  
 
(17) Employee benefits 
(i) Short-term employee benefits 
Short-term employee benefits are employee benefits that are due to be settled wholly before 12 months after the 
end of the period in which the employees render the related service. When an employee has rendered service to the 
Group during an accounting period, the Group recognizes the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits 
expected to be paid in exchange for that service.  
 
(ii) Retirement benefits: defined contribution plans 
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund.  
The Group is no longer responsible for any foreseeable future liability after a certain amount or percentage of money 
is set aside for defined contribution plans. If the pension plan allows for early retirement, payments are recognized 
as employee benefits. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for service before the end of the 
reporting period, the Group recognizes that excess as an asset to the extent that the prepayment  will lead to a 
reduction in future payments or a cash refund.  
 
(iii) Retirement benefits: defined benefit plans 
The Group classifies all the pensions as defined benefit plans except defined contribution plans. The Group’s net 
obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. 
The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit 
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future 
cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the 
benefits will be paid, and have terms to maturity similar to the terms of the related pension liability.  
 
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liabilities (assets), which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return 
on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognized 
immediately in other comprehensive income.3791Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 
 
 
3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(18) Provisions 
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
 
(19) Financial guarantees 
Financial  guarantee  contracts  are  contracts  that  require  the  issuer  (the  Bank)  to  make  specified  payments  to 
reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance 
with the original or changed terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantees are initially recognized in the financial 
statements  at  fair  value  on  the  date  the  guarantee  was  given,  and  amortized  over  the  period  of  the  guarantee. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group’s liabilities under such guarantees are measured at the higher of: 
 
-  The amount determined in accordance with K-IFRS 1037 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and ContingentAssets’ and-  The initial amount less amortization of fees recognized in accordance with K-IFRS 1018 ‘Revenue’.  
 
(20) Securities under resale or repurchase agreements 
Securities purchased under agreements to resell are recorded as other loans and receivables and the related interest 
from these securities is recorded as interest income; Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are recorded as 
borrowings, and the related interest from these securities is recorded as interest expense.  
 
(21) Policy reserves for insurance contracts 
In accordance with the Insurance Business Act and related insurance standards, the Group is required to maintain 
policy  reserves,  which  consist  of  premium  reserve,  unearned  premium  reserve,  reserve  for  outstanding  claims, 
reserve for participating policyholders’ dividends, excess participating policyholders’ dividend reserve and reserve 
for loss on participating insurance policies, as a liability which is measured in accordance with the Manual for 
Calculation of Premium and Policy Reserves as approved by the Financial Supervisory Commission. Details are as 
follows: 
 
(i) Premium reserve 
Premium reserve represents an amount calculated based on a net premium valuation, which is the greater of an 
amount calculated by using the standard interest rate and standard risk rate issued by the Financial Supervisory 
Service (FSS), and an amount calculated using an internally generated rate derived by the Group. If the reserve is 
at zero or less, the amount is to be recorded at nil.  
 
(ii) Unearned premium reserve 
Unearned premium reserve represents an amount allocated for certain premiums whose initial payment date falls 
within the current reporting period and future payments, if any, fall subsequent to the end of the reporting period.  
 
(iii) Guaranteed benefit reserve 
Guaranteed benefit reserve guarantees a certain level of the insurance claims considering expected loss in the future. 
The Group’s guaranteed benefit reserve consists of the following: 
 
-  Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit: reserves that guarantee financial resources for the pension benefitamount that equals to the predetermined value in the contract.-  Guaranteed  minimum  death  benefit:  reserves  that  guarantee  death  benefit  amount  that  equals  to  thepredetermined value in the contract.-  Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit: reserves that guarantee the interim withdrawals amount that equals tothe predetermined value in the contract during the period for interim withdrawals.-  Guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit: reserves that guarantee the interim withdrawals amount that equals tothe predetermined value in the contract during lifetime.-  Other guaranteed benefits: guaranteed benefit reserves other than those listed above for a guarantee of insuranceproceeds in excess of a certain level.3892Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 
 
 
3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(iv) Reserve for outstanding claims 
Reserve for outstanding claims represents a reserve based on estimate of loss for insured events that have occurred 
prior to the reporting date but have not yet been settled or determined, including: 
 
-  Outstanding losses: losses that have been reported to the insurer but are still in the process of settlement (in caseswhere a claim is partially paid, the remnant is reported).-  Incurred but not reported (IBNR): an estimate of the amount based on historical information of an insurer’sliability for claim-generating events that have taken place but have not yet been reported to the insurer.-  Reserve for lapsed insurance contracts: reserve for insurance cancellation refund for lapsed insurance contractsdue to non-payment of insurance premium that still can be revived or deferred within a certain period.-  Outstanding claims: legitimate claims, such as compensation, refund, dividend that an insurer has not yet paidto policy holder.(v) Reserve for participating policyholders’ dividends 
The reserve for participating policyholders’ dividends is classified into interest dividend reserve, mortality dividend 
reserve, interest rate difference guarantee reserve and long-term duration dividend reserve.  
 
(vi) Excess participating policyholders’ dividend reserve 
Pursuant  to  relevant  laws  and  contracts,  the  Group  may  provide  an  excess  participating  policyholder  dividend 
reserve based on the operating results of related insurance products. The reserve may be used to pay participating 
policyholder dividends or additional dividends.  
 
(22) Equity 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares 
and share options are recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.  
 
When the Group repurchases its share capital, the amount of the consideration paid is recognized as a deduction 
from equity and classified as treasury shares. The profits or loss from the purchase, disposal, reissue, or retirement 
of treasury shares are not recognized as current profit or loss. If the Group acquires and retains treasury shares, the 
consideration paid or received is directly recognized in equity.Non–controlling interests refer to equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Non- 
controlling  interests  consist  of  the  minority  interest  net  income  calculated  under  K-IFRS  1103  ‘Business 
Combinations’ at the date of the initial combination, and minority interest of changes in equity after the business 
combination.  
 
(23) Government subsidy 
Government subsidy without repayment obligation, which is used for the acquisition of certain assets, is accounted 
for  as  a  deduction  from  the  acquisition  cost  of  the  acquired  assets.  Such  subsidy  amount  is  offset  against  the 
depreciation or amortization of the acquired assets during such assets’ useful life.  
 
(24) Interest income and expense 
Interest  income  and  expense  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  using  the  effective  interest  method.  The  effective 
interest method measures the amortized costs of financial instruments and allocates the interest income or expense 
during the related period.  
 
Upon the calculation of the effective interest rate, the Group estimates future cash flows by taking into consideration 
all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not future credit loss. The calculation also reflects any fees or 
points paid or received, transaction costs and any related premiums or discounts. In the case that the cash flow and 
expected duration of a financial instrument cannot be estimated reliably, the effective interest rate is calculated by 
the contractual cash flow during the contract period.  
 
Once an impairment loss has been recognized on a financial asset or a group of similar assets, subsequent interest 
income is recognized on the interest rate that was used to discount future cash flow for the purpose of measuring 
the impairment loss.39.Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued93(25) Fees and commission income 
Fees and commission income and expense are classified as follows according to related regulations: 
 
(i) Fees and commission from financial instruments 
Fees and commission income and expense that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset or 
liability are included in the measurement of the effective interest rate. It includes those related to evaluation of the 
borrowers’  financial  status,  guarantee,  collateral,  other  agreements  and  related  evaluation  as  well  as  business 
transaction,  rewards  for  activities,  such  as  document  preparation  and  recording  and  setup  fees  incurred  during 
issuance of financial liabilities. However, when financial instruments are classified as financial instruments at fair 
value through profit or loss, fees and commission are recognized as revenue upon initial recognition.  
 
(ii) Fees and commission from services 
Fees and commission income charged in exchange for services to be performed during a certain period of time such 
as asset management fees, consignment fees and assurance service fees are recognized as the related services are 
performed.  When  a  loan  commitment  is  not  expected  to  result  in  the  draw-down  of  a  loan  and  K-IFRS  1039 
‘Financial  Instrument:  Recognition  and  Measurement’  is  not  applied  for  the  commitment,  the  related  loan 
commitment fees are recognized as revenue proportionally to time over the commitment period.  
 
(iii) Fees and commission from significant transaction 
Fees and commission from significant transactions, such as trading stocks and other securities, negotiation and 
mediation activities for third parties, for instance business transfer and takeover, are recognized when transactions 
are completed.  
 
(26) Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognized upon the establishment of the Group’s right to receive the payment.  
 
(27) Income tax expense 
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. Current income tax and deferred income tax are 
recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event, which is recognized 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, or a business combination.  
 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the reporting 
period when the assets are realized or the liabilities settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities reflects the income tax effects that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end 
of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.  
 
Subsidiaries calculate income tax based on their tax laws and report the amount as current income tax liability.  
 
The  Group  recognizes  deferred  income  tax  liabilities  for  all  taxable  temporary  differences  associated  with 
investments in subsidiaries, associates, and interests in joint ventures, except to the extent that the Group is able to 
control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. The Group recognizes deferred income tax assets for all deductible temporary 
differences arising from investments in associates, to the extent that it is probable that the temporary difference will 
reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be 
utilized.  
 
The carrying amount of a deferred income tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to 
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or 
all of that deferred income tax asset to be utilized.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only if the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset the 
related current income tax assets and liabilities, and the assets and liabilities relate to income tax levied by the same 
tax authority and are intended to be settled on a net basis.4094Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 
 
 
3.     Significant Accounting Policies, Continued(28) Accounting for trust accounts 
The Group, for the purpose of financial reporting, differentiates trust assets from identifiable assets according to 
the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act. Furthermore, the Group receives trust fees from the 
application, management and disposal of trust assets, and appropriates such amounts for fees from trust accounts.  
 
Meanwhile, in the case the fee from an unspecified principal or interests guaranteed money in trust does not meet 
the principal or interest amount, even after appropriating deficit with trust fees and special reserve, the Group fills 
in the remaining deficit in the trust account and appropriates such amounts for losses on trust accounts.  
  
(29) Regulatory reserve for credit losses 
When the total sum of allowance for possible credit losses under K-IFRS is lower than the amount prescribed in 
Article  29(1)  of  the  Regulations  on  supervision  of  Banking  Business,  the  Group  records  the  difference  as  a 
regulatory reserve for credit losses at the end of each reporting period.  
 
In the case that the existing regulatory reserve for credit losses exceeds the amount needed to be set aside at the 
reporting date, the surplus may be reversed. Furthermore, in the case that undisposed deficit exists, a regulatory 
reserve for credit losses is saved from the time the undisposed deficit is disposed.  
 
(30) Earnings per share 
The  Group  represents  its  diluted  and  basic  earnings  per  common  share  in  the  consolidated  statement  of 
comprehensive  income.  Basic  earnings  per  share  (EPS)  is  calculated  by  dividing  net  profit  attributable  to 
shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting 
period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting net profit attributable to common shareholders of the 
Group, considering dilution effects from all potential common shares, and the weighted average number of common 
shares outstanding.(31) Correction of errors 
Prior period errors shall be corrected by retrospective restatement in the first set of financial statements authorised 
for issue after their discovery except to the extent that it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific 
effects or the cumulative effect of the error.41Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

10.    Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Group’s derivative financial instruments consist of trading derivatives and hedging derivatives, depending on 
the nature of each transaction. The Group enters into hedging derivative transactions mainly for the purpose of 
hedging risk related to changes in fair values of the underlying assets and liabilities and future cash flows.  
 
The Group enters into trading derivative transactions such as futures, forwards, swaps and options for arbitrage 
transactions by speculating on the future value of the underlying asset. Trading derivative transactions include 
contracts with the Group’s clients and its liquidation position.  
 
For the purpose of hedging the exposure to the variability of fair values and future cash flows of funds in Korean 
won by changes in interest rate, the Group mainly uses interest swaps or currency swaps. The main counterparties 
are foreign financial institutions and local banks. In addition, to hedge the exposure to the variability of fair values 
of bonds in foreign currencies by changes in interest rate or foreign exchange rate, the Group mainly uses interest 
swaps or currency swaps.  
 
The notional amounts outstanding  for derivative contracts  and the carrying amounts of  the derivative  financial

23.    Provisions, Continued(*1) For the sale of the shares of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., Ltd. that the Bank and Korea 
Asset Management Corp. (KAMCO) had held, the Bank, KAMCO and Hanhwa Chemical Co., Ltd. (Hanhwa 
Chemical), which was on behalf of the Hanhwa Consortium, entered into the memorandum of understanding 
on  November  14,  2008,  but  the  memorandum  was  revoked  as  reasons  attributable  to  Hanhwa  Chemical. 
Accordingly, the Bank and KAMCO took W195 billion and W120 billion, respectively, provided by Hanhwa 
Chemical as the performance guarantee. Relating to the performance guarantee, Hanhwa Chemical brought a 
law suit but the first and the second trial ruled in favor of the Bank because the courts of the first and the second 
trial regarded the performance guarantee as a penalty for the breach of the memorandum. On July 14, 2016, 
the Supreme Court judged unlike the first and the second trial that the performance guarantee was provided in 
order to compensate damages and the Bank’s taking all the performance guarantee was unfair, and remanded 
the case to the original court. After the reporting period, the case was terminated on January 11, 2018 and 
decided  partially  in  favour  of  Hanhwa  Chemical.  In  accordance  with  the  ruling,  the  Bank  recognized  the 
amount to be paid to Hanhwa Chemical as a lawsuit provision as of December 31, 2017.ContentsClaim for debt absence  WDecember 31, 2016AmountsPlaintiff:Korea Land & Housing

53.    Risk Management(1) Introduction 
 
(i) Objectives and principles 
The Group’s risk management aims to maintain financial soundness and effectively manage various risks pertinent 
to  the  nature  of  the  Group’s  business.  The  Group  has  set  up  and  fulfilled  policies  to  manage  risks  timely  and 
effectively. Pursuant to the policies, the Group’s risks shall be 
- managed comprehensively and independently, 
- recognized timely, evaluated exactly and managed effectively, 
- maintained to the extent that the risks balance with profit, 
- diversified appropriately to avoid concentration on specific segments, 
- managed to prevent excessive exposure by the setting up and managing of tolerance limits and guidelines.  
 
(ii) Risk management strategy and process 
The Group’s risk management business is separated into two different stages; the ‘metrification stage,’ in which 
risks  are  estimated  and  monitored,  and  the  ‘integration  stage,’  in  which  information  gained  during  the  risk 
management process is integrated and used in management strategies. Risk management is recognized as a key 
component of the Group’s management, and seeks to change from its previously adaptive and limited role to more 
leading and comprehensive role.

progressive consensus on risk management.

(Implemented in 2018)(vii) Response to Basel 
The Korean financial authorities have implemented Basel II since January 2008, and adopted the Standardized 
Approach and the Foundation Internal Ratings-Based Approach.  
 
In conformity with the implementation roadmap of Basel II, the Group obtained the approval to use the Foundation 
Internal Ratings-Based Approach on credit risk from the FSS in July 2008 and has applied the approach since late 
June 2008. The Group applies the Standardized Approach on market risks and operational risks.  
 
The Group completed the Basel III standard risk management system in preparation of the adoption of the Basel III 
regulations announced on December 1, 2013. Starting from 2013 year-end, the BIS capital adequacy ratio has been 
measured in accordance to the Basel III regulations.  
 
Responding to the requirement of the financial authorities, the Group recognizes interest rate risk, liquidity risk, 
credit bias risk and reputational risk as well as Pillar I risks (credit risk, market risk and operational risk). Since 
2015,  the  Group  has  responded  to  Pillar  II  regulations  including  additional  capital  requirements  based  on 
comprehensive  assessment  on  bank  risk  management  level.  Since  the  end  of  2015,  the  Group  has  applied  the 
uniform standards for the public announcement of financial business for Basel compliance.  
 
Furthermore, the Group is in the process of preparing revised standards such as capital requirements for banks’ 
investments in funds, which will take effect in 2017, and the Standardised Approach for measuring counterparty 
credit risk (SA-CCR), which will take effect in 2018.117170Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

53.    Risk Management, Continued(viii) Internal capital adequacy assessment process 
Internal capital adequacy assessment process is defined as the process that the Group aggregates significant risks, 
calculates its internal capital, compares the internal capital with the available capital and assesses its internal capital 
adequacy.  
 
- Internal capital adequacy assessment 
For the purpose of the internal capital adequacy assessment, the Group calculates its aggregated internal capital 
by evaluating all significant risks and available capital taking into account the quality and components of capital, 
and then assesses the internal capital adequacy by comparing the aggregated internal capital with the available 
capital. In addition, the Group conducts periodic stress tests more than once every six months to assess potential 
weakness in crisis situations and uses its results to assess the internal capital adequacy. The Group assumes the 
macroeconomic  situation  as  four  stages  of  ‘normal-aggravation-pessimistic-serious’  and  is  preparing 
countermeasures such as checking the adequacy of capital by each stage. 
 
- Goal setting of internal capital management 
The Group sets up and manages an internal capital limit on an annual basis, through the approval of the Risk 
Management Committee, in order to maintain internal capital adequacy by managing internal capital (integrated 
risks) within the extent of available capital.  
 
The prior year’s internal capital, analysis of domestic and foreign environment changes in the current year, and 
the direction and size of operations are all reflected in the goal setting of internal capital management to calculate 
the integrated internal capital scale. Moreover, Bank for International Settlements(“BIS”) capital adequacy ratio 
and risk appetite are taken into consideration in the goal setting of internal capital management   
 
- Allocation of internal capital 
The  Group’s  entire  internal  capital  is  allocated  to  each  segment  and  department,  according  to  the  extent  of 
possible risk faced and size of operations, after the Risk Management Committee’s deliberation and the board of 
directors’ approval. The allocated internal capital is monitored regularly and managed using various management 
methods.  The  results  of  monitoring  and  managing  the  allocated  internal  capital  are  reported  to  the  Risk 
Management Committee. In case of any material changes in the Group’s business plan or risk operation strategy, 
the Group adjusts the allocations elastically.- Composition of internal capital 
Internal  capital  comprises  all  the  significant  risks  of  the  Group  and  is  composed  of  quantifiable  and  non-
quantifiable risks. Quantifiable risks are composed of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk 
and credit concentration risk, foreign currency settlement risk, and are risks measured quantitatively by applying 
reasonable methodology using objective data. Non-quantifiable risks are composed of strategy risk, reputation 
risk, residual risk on asset securitization and furthermore. Non-quantifiable risks are those risks that cannot be 
measured quantitatively because of lack of data or the absence of appropriate measuring methodologies.118Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

53.    Risk Management, Continued171(2) Credit Risk 
 
(i) Concept 
Credit  risk  can  be  defined  as  potential  loss  resulting  from  the  refusal  to  perform  obligations  or  default  of 
counterparties. More generally, it is  used to refer to the possibility of loss  from engaged bonds that cannot be 
redeemed properly or from substitute payments.  
 
(ii) Approach to credit risk management 
 
Summary of credit risk management 
The Group regards credit risk as the most significant risk area in its business operations, and accordingly, closely 
monitors its credit risk exposure. The Group manages both credit risks at portfolio level and at individual credit 
level. At portfolio level, the Group reduces credit concentration and restructures the portfolio in such a way to 
maximize profitability considering the risk level. To avoid credit concentration on a particular sector, the Group 
manages credit limits by client, group, and industry. The Group also resets exposure management directives for 
each industry by conducting an industry credit evaluation twice a year.At  the  individual  credit  level,  the  relationship  manager  (RM),  the  credit  officer  (CO)  and  the  Credit  Review 
Committee manage each borrower’s credit risk.  
 
Post management and insolvent borrower management 
The Group monitors the borrower’s credit rating from the date of the loan to the date of the final collection of debt 
consistently, and inspects the borrower’s status regularly and frequently in order to prevent the generation of new 
bad debts and to stabilize the number of debt recoveries.  
 
In addition, an early warning system is operated to spot borrowers that are highly likely to be insolvent. The early 
warning system provides financial information, financial transaction information, public information and market 
information of the borrower, and such information is used by the RM and the CO to monitor and manage changes 
in the borrower’s credit rating.  
 
Under the early warning system, a borrower that is highly likely to be insolvent is classified as an early warning 
borrower or a precautionary borrower The Group sets up a specific and applicable stabilization plan for such a 
borrower  considering  the  borrower’s  characteristics.  Furthermore,  sub-standard  borrowers  are  classified  as 
insolvent  borrowers,  and  are  managed  intensively  by  the  Group,  which  takes  legal  proceedings,  disposals  or 
corporate turnaround measures if necessary.  
 
Classification of asset soundness and provision of allowance for loss 
Classification of asset soundness is fulfilled by the analysis and assessment of credit risk. The classification is used 
in order to provision an appropriate allowance, prevent further occurrences of insolvent assets and promote the 
normalization of existing insolvent assets to enhance the stabilization of asset operations.  
 
Based on the Financial Supervisory Regulations of the Republic of Korea, the Group has established standards and 
guidelines on the classification of asset soundness, according to the Forward Looking Criteria (FLC), which reflects 
not only the borrower’s past records of repayment but also their future debt repayment capability.  
 
In conformity with these standards, the Group classifies the soundness of its assets as “normal”, “precautionary”, 
“substandard”, “doubtful”, or “estimated loss” and differentiates the coverage ratio by the level of classification.119172Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

Pursuant to Basel II, the Group selects the measurement methodology of credit risk considering the complexity of 
measurement,  measurement  factors,  estimating  methods  and  others.  Measurement  approaches  are  divided  into 
Standardized Approach and Internal Ratings-Based Approach.  
 
Standardized Approach (SA) 
In the case of the Standardized Approach, the risk weights are applied according to the credit rating assessed by 
External Credit Assessment Institution (ECAI). Risk weights in each credit rating are as follows:Credit rating  
AAA ~ AA-A+ ~ A-BBB+ ~ BBB-BB+ ~ BB-B+ ~ B-Corporate

Co., Ltd., NICE Investors Services Co., Ltd. and the Korea Ratings Co., Ltd. are designated as domestic ECAI.  
 
The Group applies the credit rating based on the corresponding loan and same borrower’s unsecured senior loans. 
In the case the borrower’s risk weight is higher than the unrated exposure’s risk weight (100%), the higher weight 
is applied. In the case the borrower has more than one rating, the higher weight of the two lowest weights (second 
best criteria) is applied.122175Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

53.    Risk Management, ContinuedInternal Ratings-Based Approach (IRB) 
To  use  the  Internal  Ratings-Based  Approach,  a  bank  must  be  approved  by  the  FSS  and  should  also  meet  the 
requirement pre-set by the FSS.  
 
In relation to Basel II that has been adopted domestically as of January 2008, the Group gained approval from the 
FSS to use the Foundation Internal Ratings-Based Approach in July 2008. The Group has calculated credit risk-
weighted assets using the approach since late June 2008.  
 
Measurement method of credit risk-weighted asset 
The Group calculates credit risk-weighted assets of corporate exposures and asset securitization exposures using 
the Foundation Internal Ratings-Based Approach as of December 31, 2017. 
 
The  Standardized  Approach  is  applied  to  country  exposures,  public  institution  exposures  and  bank  exposures 
according to the interpretation of the FSS permanently, and applied to overseas subsidiary and the Bank’s branch 
pursuant to prior consultation with the FSS.  
 
The Standard Approach is applied to special finance, non-residents, non-banking financial institutions currently, 
and will be replaced by the Internal Ratings-Based Approach in the future.

The Group calculates the credit risk-weighted assets using the capital adequacy ratio.  
 
Upon the calculation of credit risk-weighted assets for derivatives, the Group takes into consideration the set-off 
effects of transactions under legally enforceable rights to set-off to calculate exposures.123176Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

Using the Group’s internal credit rating model, the Group classifies debtors’ credit rating into 10 grades (AAA~D). 
Plus sign (+) and minus sign (-) are attached to the grades (AA~B) to distinguish the difference between credits in 
the same grade. As a result, the Group’s credit rating model uses 20 grades.  
 
The Group’s regular credit rating process is carried out once a year and in the case of the change of debtor’s credit 
condition, the credit rating is frequently adjusted as necessary to retain the adequacy of credit rating.  
 
The results of credit rating are applied to various areas such as discrimination of loan processes, loan limit, loan 
interest  rate,  post  loan  management  standard  process,  credit  risk  measurement,  and  allowance  for  loan  losses 
assessment.Credit process control structure 
According to the Principle of Checks and Balances, the Group has established the credit process control structure 
by which the credit rating system operates appropriately.  
 
-  Independent  assessment  of  credit  rating:  The  Group’s  business  segment  (RM)  and  credit  rating  assessmentsegment (CO) are independently operated.- Independent control of credit rating system: The control of credit rating system including the development ofcredit rating model is independently implemented by the Group’s Risk Management Department.- Independent verification of credit rating system: Credit rating system is independently verified by the validationteam of the Consulting Service Department.-  Independent  audit  of  credit  rating  process:  Credit  rating  process  is  audited  by  the  Group’s  internal  auditdepartment.- Role of the Board of Directors and the Group’s management: Major issues relating to credit process are approvedby the Board of Directors and are regularly monitored by the Group’s top management.The Group reviews debt serviceability based on a credit analysis when handling loans. Depending on the results, 
credit loan preservation is adjusted as necessary using such methods as interest rate preservation due to credit risk.  
 
The Group evaluates the value of the collateral, performing ability and legal validity of the guarantee at the initial 
acquisition. The Group re-evaluates the provided collateral and guarantees regularly  for them to be reasonably 
preserved.  
 
For guarantees, the Group demands a corresponding written guarantee according to loan handling standards and the 
guarantor’s  credit  rating  is  independently  calculated  when  in  conformance  with  the  credit  rating  endowment 
method.125(iv) Credit exposure

(i) Capital adequacy 
The FSS approved the Group’s use of the Foundation Internal Ratings-Based Approach in July 2008. The Group 
has been using the same approach when calculating credit risk-weighted assets since the end of June 2008. The 
equity  capital  ratio  and  equity  capital  according  to  the  standards  of  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements  are 
calculated  for  the  purpose  of  such  disclosure.  The  equity  capital  ratio  and  equity  capital  are  calculated  on  a 
consolidated basis. In conformity  with the Banking  Act, which is based on the implementation of Basel III on 
December 1, 2013, the regulatory capital is divided into the following two categories.  
 
Tier 1 capital (Common Equity Tier 1 + Additional Tier 1 capital) 
- Common Equity Tier 1 
Regulatory  capital  that  represents  the  most  subordinated  claim  in  liquidation  of  the  Group,  takes  the  first  and 
proportionately greatest share of any losses as they occur, and which principal is never repaid outside of liquidation 
meets the criteria for classification as common equity, including capital stock, capital surplus, retained earnings, 
qualifying  non-controlling  interests  in  subsidiaries,  and  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  as  common 
equity Tier 1.  
 
-  Additional Tier 1 capital 
Capital stock and capital surplus related to issuance of capital securities that are subordinated, have non-cumulative 
and conditional dividends or interests, and have no maturity or step-up conditions.Tier 2 capital (Supplementary Tier 2 capital) 
Regulatory capital that fulfils supplementary capital adequacy requirements, and includes subordinated debt with 
maturities over 5 years and allowance for loan losses in conformity with external regulatory standards and internal 
standards.130183Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

53.    Risk Management, Continued(4) Market risk 
 
(i) Concept 
Market risk is defined as the possibility of potential loss on a trading position resulting from fluctuations in interest 
rates, foreign exchange rates and the price of stocks and derivatives. Trading position is exposed to risks, such as 
interest rate, stock price, and foreign exchange rate, etc. Non-trading position is mostly exposed to interest rates. 
Accordingly, the Group classifies market risks into those exposed from trading position or those exposed from non-
trading position.  
 
(ii) Market risks of trading positions 
 
Management method on market risks arising from trading positions 
Trading position includes securities, foreign exchange position, and derivatives which are traded for short-term 
profits.  
 
Market risk is managed using VaR limit and loss limit. VaR limit is calculated in the view of entire Group and the 
calculated VaR limit is distributed into each department and each type (stock price, interest rate, foreign exchange 
rate and option). The trading department regulates and operates terms of stop loss and investment limits.  
 
Using the Standardized Approach and internal model of VaR, the Group’s VaR is measured daily and the measured 
VaR is used for risk monitoring and limit management. In the estimation of VaR, the historical simulation and two 
other  supplemental  procedures  are  used:  variance-covariance  matrix  and  Monte  Carlo  simulation.  Through  the 
stress test and back test, the estimation of VaR is validated daily.  
 
In estimating market risk, the Standardized Approach and the internal model are used. The Standardized Approach 
is used in order to calculate the required capital from market risk and the internal model is used in order to manage 
risks internally.  
 
Since July 2007, the Group has measured one-day VaR through the historical simulation method using the time 
series data of past 250 days under a 99% confidence level. The calculated VaR is monitored on a daily basis.  
 
The Group sets total limit of market risk based on annual business plan, risk appetite and others and monitors VaR 
limit of each department on a daily basis.132185Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries

214,877(iii) Market risks of non-trading positions 
 
Management method on market risks arising from non-trading positions 
The most critical market risk that arises in non-trading position is the interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is defined 
as the likely loss resulting from the unfavorable fluctuation of interest rate in the Group’s financial condition and is 
measured by interest rate VaR and interest rate EaR.  
 
Interest rate VaR is the maximum amount of decrease in net asset value resulting from the unfavorable fluctuation 
of interest rate. Interest rate EaR is the maximum amount of decrease in net interest income resulting from the 
unfavorable fluctuation of interest rate for a year.  
 
The Group’s interest rate VaR and interest rate EaR are measured through the simulation of conclusive interest rate 
scenario  with  the  FERMAT  and  are  reported  on  a  monthly  basis  to  the  Risk  Management  Committee.  The 
Management’s  target  of  interest  rate  VaR  and  interest  rate  EaR  are  approved  at  the  beginning  of  the  year. 
Additionally, the interest rate VaR and interest rate EaR on consolidated basis are calculated using the Standardized 
Approach in order to retain the consistency in the methods used by the Bank and its subsidiaries.  
.

53.    Risk Management, Continued(5) Liquidity risk management 
 
(i) Concept 
Liquidity risk is defined as the possibility of potential loss due to a temporary shortage in funds caused by a maturity 
mismatch or an unexpected capital outlay. Liquidity risk soars when funding rates rise, assets are sold below a 
normal price, or a good investment opportunity is missed.  
 
(ii) Approach to liquidity risk management 
The Group manages its liquidity risks as follows:Allowable limit for liquidity risk 
ž The allowable limit for liquidity risk sets LCR, foreign currency liquidity ratio, and remaining maturity gap 
ž The management standards with regards to the allowable limit for liquidity risk should be set using separate andstringent set ratios in accordance with the FSS guidelines.<Measurement Methodology> 
ž LCR: (High quality liquid assets / Total net cash outflows over the next 30 calendar days) X 100 
ž Foreign  currency  liquidity  ratio:  (Maturing  liquidity  asset  in  the  interval  /  Maturing  liquidity  liability  in  the 
interval) X 100ž Remaining maturity gap: (Maturing liquidity asset in the interval - Maturing liquidity liability in the interval) /total assets X 100Early warning indicator 
In order to identify prematurely and cope with worsening liquidity risk trends, the Group has set up 16 indexes such 
as the “Foreign Exchange Stabilization Bond CDS Premium,” and measures the trend monthly, weekly and daily 
as a means for establishing the allowable liquidity risk limit complementary measures.  
 
Stress-Test analysis and contingency plan 
ž The  Group  evaluates  the  effects  on  the  liquidity  risk  and  identifies  the  inherent  flaws.  In  the  case  where  an 
unpredictable and significant liquidity crisis occurs, the Group executes risk situation analysis quarterly based on 
crisis specific to the Group, market risk and complex emergency, and reports to the Risk Management Committee 
for the purpose of the Group’s solvency securitization.ž The Group established detailed contingency plan to manage the liquidity risks at every risk situations.136189Korea Development Bank and Subsidiaries
